The Duty of Massachusetts.
SPEECH OF CHARLES C. BURLEIGH,
Before the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society,
January 28, 1859.
Phonographically reported for the Liberator, by Mr. YERRINTON.
MR. PRESIDENT-The subject which is presented to us in this resolution, I am glad to know, is one claiming no small share of attention at the present time, throughout the Commonwealth; and indeed <illegible>in the Commonwealth alone. We have had, as we were told yesterday, an example set before us in a neighboring State, in relation to this matter, worthy to be imitated by those who believe in the fundamental principles embodied in the Massachusetts Constitution, and in the American Declaration of Independence.
I have, in my going up and down in the land, very often had occasion to meet those who objected to what they called the sweeping condemnation passed by Abolitionists on the people of the Commonwealth, and especially on the political parties of the North, by reason of their complicity with slaveholding. I have been told-' We are as much opposed to slavery as you are; we do not mean to do any thing to give strength to the oppressor's arm; and we do not feel that the severe censures passed upon us are deserved.' I have replied by asking them-'Are you ready to do this thing:-You say that you cannot reach slavery in Carolina and Virginia, and must not be condemned because you do not assail it there; are you ready to purify the soil of the Old Bay State from the contamination of slavery! Are you ready to say, that whenever a man sets his foot upon the soil of the Commonwealth, he shall be recognized as a man, and shall be treated as a man?' And I have not always found them ready to say yes to this inquiry. If, in general terms, at the first propounding thereof, they would say yes, yet upon a closer cross-examination, upon a more minute specification of the measures necessary to attain the general object, they would often shrink from replying in the affirmative-sometime assigning one reason, sometimes another, the whole, however, summed up in this- 'The Union and the Constitution.' We cannot say to the South, you shall no longer claim your runaways upon the soil of Massachusetts-you shall no longer blot out the Wood-stained footprints of Concord and Lexington with the- foul tread of the kidnapper and slave-hunter-we cannot say this to the South, because the Constitution guarantees to the South the right to hunt runaways all over the North; to seize them wherever they shall be found, and to drag them back to slavery from the very door of the sanctuary of liberty they may have endeavored to find shelter in. No matter that we have proclaimed to the nations, as a self-evident truth, the equal, inalienable rights of all men; no matter that we are preaching from a thousand pulpits the doctrine of human brotherhood-that God, who made the world, hath of one blood made all nations to dwell on the face of the earth; no matter that our fathers stood for the defence of those principles in the day of trial and danger, perilling their lives, on the high places of the field; no matter that they baptized their infant liberty with blood, on the spot where stands yonder granite column, telling of the deeds that were done for impartial freedom; no matter that the voice of musketry and artillery, from the banks of Concord river and the Common of Lexington, spoke out defiant words for justice an humanity, in the very face of the tyrant's displeasure and menace;-all that is nothing, because, at a later day the fathers consented to erase these glorious words of their earlier history, that they might find room upon the page, made black by the erasure, to write a covenant with death and an agreement with hell'-to write a compact binding them to give the lie to the glorious declaration of a previous day, binding them to bring upon their own souls that very stain of complicity with tyranny which they deemed so dark a spot upon the character of their mother land and its government. We cannot, then, they tell us, be just, we cannot be true to the principles which our fathers announced in their declaration, we cannot be humane and Christian. There is the Gospel of Jesus, with the glorious example of the Good Samaritan, bending over the sufferer by the wayside, at the risk of no matter what peril to his own person or damage to his own interest,-with its high lessons self-denial, self-sacrifice, and generous deeds of benevolence, with its solemn injunction to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, and take in the houseless wanderer, and recognize in every poor and suffering child of humanity, only the disguised form, but none the less real form, of Him who was the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of his person'; of Him who, speaking now through the poverty-wasted lips and now with the tongue of the sable bondman, says-' Inasmuch as ye have done deeds of kindness unto one of these my brethren, ye have done them unto me.' We know it is there; we read it every morning; we hear it every Sunday from our pulpits; we are aware that the injunction stands there, that the example is recorded there, that glorious spirit is diffused all through that blessed Gospel, and we in the presence of God, angels and men, have entered into solemn covenant that we will be true to that Gospel, that we will take it as the man of our counsel, as the rule of our life, as the law of our spiritual existence and action. Yet, because our fathers made a bargain to secure certain political advantages, that they would repudiate this Gospel when its application demanded humanity to
Resolved, That, whether the people of Massachusetts can do anything to abolish slavery in the South or not, they can forbid, and are imperatively bound by the highest moral considerations to forbid, the hunting of fugitive slaves in this Commonwealth, and to decree the immediate emancipation of all such as soon as they touch our soil; they can and ought to cease from all slaveholding relations with the South; and therefore they can and ought, in common with the people of every other free State, to withdraw from a government which, both by practice and intention, is a grand conspiracy against justice, and a powerful bulwark of the slave system.
<c02>
the bondman, justice to the oppressed, therefore will we be inhuman to the bondman, unjust to the oppressed; therefore will we trample our solemn covenant with God, made in the presence of God, angels and men, under our feet; and that we may be true to a man-made Constitution, all black with iniquity and bloody with crime, we will be false to the most sacred obligations of humanity and Christianity.
I do not say that men answer me in these words. I am translating their answer out of the dialect of wily politicians and cunning sophists, into plain language, which the common people can understand. You and I know that my translation is a faithful one, lacking, it may be, the force which it would be desirable to impart to it, because the speech of man has no symbols to match the ideas and the facts with which we hare to deal on this occasion.
Well, then, I meet the question as it is propounded, Has the Commonwealth of Massachusetts a right to refuse protection to the bondman, to refuse a recognition of his manhood, to refuse to repel the aggressions of the Slave Power, and the intrusion of the kidnapper within her borders? Has Massachusetts a right to sell conscience, and humanity, and God, for so poor a mess of pottage as is brought to her in the leaky vessel of the American Union, serving only, as it bubbles from the cauldron, hell-heated, to scald her own tongue with the dripping stream, and failing to satisfy her thirsting lip with the disappointing draught. (Loud applause.)
I say that Massachusetts has no such right; and I say it conceding, for the present moment, that the compact is, in letter and spirit, what it is assumed to be; because, assuming it to be such, it is so grossly and monstrously immoral, so flagrantly at variance with the principles acknowledged by the Commonwealth as self-evidently true, such an outrage upon humanity and decency, that it cannot be a binding compact. No man can bind himself, no community of men can bind itself, by no matter what bargains, to do what God, forbids, to do what conscience clearly and emphatically condemns. You tell me it is legal, this claim of the slaveholder; you tell me it is constitutional, this right which he arrogates to himself to turn men into brutes by the help, of the government. I tell you I do not care for your terms 'legal, 'and 'constitutional. 'I might stand here and argue whether it is, in any just sense of the term, 'legal'; and if you quote Kent and Story, Marshall and Taney, I might, on the other hand, quote Blackstone, Coke and Vattel; and I might ask you, if legal authority is to stand, whether that legal authority which exists afar from the overshadowing influence of the slave system, is less likely to be affected by those evil influences, or that authority which, standing the very midst of this shadow, is dimmed and bewildered by it. But without stopping to inquire as to the fitness of the application of the term 'legal' to this claim of the slaveholder, it is enough for me to be able to apply to it the epithets immoral, infamous, atrocious. I say to a citizen of Massachusetts, Do you not believe that the slave is a man, and your brother?-and few are the citizens of Massachusetts, so hardy as to answer No! They tell us that even the Boston Courier is beginning to claim for itself a due deference to the manhood of the black man; and if the Boston Courier has found out that it is expedient to say this, you may depend upon it, that the Boston Courier knows that Massachusetts believes it is right; and if the Boston Courier believes it is right, who will face the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with the imputation upon its character, that it doubts the rectitude of what even the Boston Courier feels to be right? You admit, then, that the slave is a man, and your brother; you admit that he has the same essential and inalienable rights that you have. You would skulk away in Roger B. Taney's poor hiding place, and pretend that when the Constitution was made, the public sentiment of the civilized world regarded the black man as 'having no rights which the white man is bound to respect. 'But even if that lie were a truth, it would not help the case at all, for your obligation dates back to a period older than your Constitution; and a part of the indictment which is read against you, and to which you must plead in Heaven's court, if not on earth, is that you consent to a Constitution which accepted as its basis, and incorporated into its structure, that horrible blasphemy against God, and that insult to man, that any child of the Eternal Father is destitute of rights worthy of the recognition of every other child of that Father. I ask you, assuming that your Constitution was based upon this principle of essential wickedness, What right had your fathers to accept that Constitution as the supreme law of the land? What right have you, now that your fathers have so accepted it, and transmitted to you the tradition of allegiance to it, to accept that tradition, and ratify the contract which has thus been made with the powers of darkness? That is the question which the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts must answer. They may try to evade it today; they may try to dodge it to to-morrow; they may try to silence it with the previous question, or a motion to indefinitely postpone in the State House; they may try to slur it over in the platform of the political campaign approaching; they may try to avoid it in the discussions of the political press; they may even put it out of sight in the homilies of the pulpit and the religious newspapers-but the question must be answered! It has been written out in the sight of men, it has been spoken in the ears of men, and there is no escaping it after that. The murderer who, meditating on his deed of blood, thought that,
'If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well
It were done quickly,'
could as easily wash out the memory of that day, and make the event to 'trammel up its consequence -could as easily close the eyes of that inner vision, which he shared not with any who shared not his consciousness of guilt, against the spectre that crowded him from his stool, and usurped his place at the banquet-as the Commonwealth of Massachusetts blind her eyes to this question, which is glaring out upon her from the skies that hang the North Star out to guide the fugitive in his flight, and speaks to her in the very murmur of the forest, which hears only, besides that murmur, the tread of the bondman on his way to Canada. The question must be met, then, has Massachusetts a right to abide by an unhallowed compact? And deep down in the heart of
<c03>
Massachusetts, if not very loud and audible to the outward ear, yet clearly, distinctly, in tones which imperatively demand audience, the answer to this question has already formed itself into syllables which will scorch the soul which refuses to heed them. (Loud applause.)Massachusetts has no right! It is the common sense of universal humanity, it is the doctrine of religion and morality, it is the principle of law itself, which forbids obedience to an immoral injunction, compliance with the terms of an immoral compact. If I ask the men of Massachusetts, Will you ratify a bargain made by your predecessors to sanctify murder with the warrant of statute law and judicial precedent?-the men of Massachusetts will probably look at me with mingled astonishment and indignation, hesitating between the latter emotion for the insult offered, and the former that any man should dare to offer such an insult. And yet, if you are set to institute a careful comparison between murder and the chattelization of manhood-if against the single atrocity of the one crime you balance the complex and innumerable atrocities of the other, who is there of you that is willing to avow his belief that it is less immoral, less criminal, to sanction slaveholding, than it is to sanction murder? If any, for him I have this question: Bring the matter home to yourself, in such form as will set it closest to your most central consciousness, whether it be in imagining that you are to be the victim of one or the other crime, or in imagining that some object of your tenderest affection is to be that victim. Fancy to yourself, for a moment, the alternative presented, whether the wife that you love, whether the daughter now blushing into beautiful womanhood, around whom cluster your strongest affections, and upon whom rests a father's purest pride, shall fall dead at your feet, and to-morrow be laid away in the safe sanctuary of the grave, -with the sheltering clods of the valley above her form, or whether she shall be grasped by the kidnapper and torn from your very presence, to be exposed for sale on the auction stand of the human flesh market, and be struck off to him who will bid the largest sum of filthy gold for the privilege of desecrating that sanctuary of the Holy Ghost, polluting that dwelling-place of the social and domestic affections, and turning that most beautiful specimen of fair humanity into the abode of impurity, and the scene of deepest degradation! Picture to yourself the presentation of that alternative, and anticipate your own answer to my question ; and in that answer hear your judgment of the comparative guilt of him who strikes the merciful blow of murder, and him who binds around his victim the poisonous coil of the slave's chain, blister­ing body and spirit together at every point of contact, festering to the core of the soul's, inmost being with a corruption darker than essential impurity itself, and more terrible to bear than the fires of unending perdition. You have answered the question long before I have done asking it, and have been reproving me in your souls for lingering in my tardy and halting speech behind the unerring and lightning-like readiness of your response. Well, then, you have answered the question, whether Massachusetts has any right to giveback the runaway slave to his master; for you know that all these sophistical distinctions which our selfishness and pride-sometimes with diabolical malice more than diabolical ingenuity whisper in our ears- you know that these are of no avail before the searching eye which looks to the very motive of our act, and sees that we are false to the convictions of our own souls when we seek the justification for our wrong in the color of its victim.
Grant, if you will, that the fugitive bondman coming from Carolina or Virginia belongs to an inferior race. I will not stop to argue that question now but the inquiry might very well arise, why it is that this haughty Saxon race, so conscious of its own superiority, is so afraid to trust a rival race to compete with it on equal terms for the world's prizes? Concede that it is an inferior race with which we have to deal,-what then? Is that inferiority the justification for robbing it of that precious boon which the Father has bestowed upon it? Or, in other words, do you justify plunder by the poverty of its victim? Do you lamb, brought up in his bosom, while you have many flocks and herds spread over your rich estate, you may therefore feed your guests with the flesh of his lamb, and dread no coming of God's stern prophet on the morrow to make you condemn yourself with your own lips, and ratify the condemnation with the words-'Thou art the man!' You know it is no justification. The slave comes here and asks for protection. You know you owe it to him. Tell me you did not bargain it in the Constitution-what then? Why didn't you bargain it in the Constitution, and what right had you to refuse to bargain it to him in the Constitution? When a man comes from a distant land to ours and asks to be sheltered under the roof of our 'asylum for the oppressed of all nations,' we bid him welcome, come from what quarter he may. Even was ready to welcome Garibaldi from the wars of freedom in Italy, and the nation rises up with loud acclaim to greet the arrival of the Hungarian patriot; yes, and even far abroad in the harbor of Smyrna, far as the nation can reach out the arm of its power, it protects the refugee who has announced his purpose to become a citizen of our country. So there is the nation's own answer to the question of its moral obligation.
Now, have you any right to barter away the rights of your fellow-men, and can you barter away your own obligation? Remember, that when you make a bargain that you will not protect Martin Kozta in the harbor of Smyrna, that you will not shield Kossuth from the myrmidons of Austria seeking him in the streets of Boston, that you will not shelter Garibaldi from the ministers of the Pope, you have not merely attempted to divest yourselves of a moral obligation, you have attempted to sell away that which does not belong to you-another man's rights. My right to be protected here upon the soil of Massachusetts is a right which God gave me, and not the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Suppose that before the Pilgrims landed from the Mayflower upon Plymouth rock, and gave occasion for the lifting up of that high strain of the English poet-
What sought they thus afar?
Bright jewels of the mine,
The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?
<c04>
They sought a Faith's pure shrine,
Aye, call it holy ground
The spot where first they trod;
They've left unstained what here they found,
Freedom to worship God'-
suppose that before that event, when this continent is yet a wilderness, was untrodden by the white man's foot-go back, if you will, to a still earlier period, before the red man had come here from the forests where he had chased his game, and suppose that some wanderer from a civilized land had been drifted to these shores by adverse gales, and had met here, borne unwillingly from some other region of the civilized world, one like himself, a solitary refugee from the fury of the tempest, what were their obliga­tions? Not constitutional-for they had made no Constitution; not legal-for they had enacted no law; not arising from any compact, or covenant,-for they had entered into none. What were their mutual obligations? When God wrote upon the soul of man the law of his social nature, put into him the power to feel for and with his suffering and imperilled fellows, then he wrote the mandate commanding him to help the suffering and the endangered. Now, can you repeal that Constitution of God by any of your man­made compacts? Can you rob that solitary wanderer from England, we will say, of the right to the protection of his fellow-wanderer from France or Germany, by making a bargain that it shall not be given? I owe you a debt; can I cancel that debt by simply writing under the obligation which attests it that I shall not recognize it henceforward? Certainly not. Until, then, you can cancel the obligation of simple humanity to simple humanity, the obligation of kindness and mutual benefit and protection, you cannot get any right whereon to base your constitutional compact to give up the runaway slave to his master. (Applause.) You come together, not two individuals, drifting hither from opposite regions of the earth, but multiplied to twenty millions, and yet every one under this same obligation which God had fixed upon the first individual man who set foot upon these shores;-you come together, each bound by that divine law, and can you any more shake it off by the multitude of your concurrence than could the individual effort of the single solitary wanderer? If a house is built of blocks of granite, it is a granite house, no matter what incantations, are muttered over it, no matter what inscriptions you engrave upon its front. Whatever is inherent in the individual constituents of the collective mass is inherent in the mass itself; and therefore the obligation to protect every man who sets his foot upon your soil, is as perfect when you have formed a Union and Constitution, as it was when one man by the side of another stood in need of help, when one man by the side of another had power to help. You can never escape from that obligation.
What is the making of a government? Simply this: the construction of a machine more effectively to do that work, the doing of which was every man's duty before the government was made. Suppose I owe a man an obligation to reap his harvest upon the prairies of Illinois, and when I go to look at it, I find there is an immense range of territory covered by the grain, and I say-'Here is a mighty obligation; what shall I do? I can never reap down that field with the old sickle my grandfather used on the hills of New England; I can never lay that harvest even in the swarth with the cradle I used in my. early manhood; I must devise some other means to accomplish it.' So I sit down, and, tasking my Yankee ingenuity to the utmost, I build in the recesses of my mind a reaping machine, and then I drag that reaping machine out of the subtle chambers of the brain and incarnate it in wood and iron, and there it stands palpable and practical before me. Now I have released myself, for­sooth, say our learned statesmen and profound jurists, from my obligation; because I have made a machine that can do in one day what would have taken me six months to accomplish! Do you believe that? No; the making of the machine is to be justified by the use to which it is put; and that use is the fulfilment of my obligation. Government is made to protect the rights of the governed. That is not, I think, one of the modern, ultra, radical, anti-slavery, Garrisonian obligations. I think we read it in a document once regarded of some authority, in this country, at least- that the purpose of the institution of government is to protect the rights of the governed. Now, I ask you, is the slave one of your governed when he comes to Massachusetts or not? If not, then you have no right to govern him, but must leave him to go and come when and where he pleases. If he is, then you have bound yourselves to protect him by your government, in the simple fact that you have made a government. You have only transferred to it, as the instrument of your action, the obligation already rested upon you, by virtue of God's decree, written in your very souls.
That, then, is our answer to those who talk to us about the Constitution. We contend that inasmuch as slaveholding is the violation of all human rights, that inasmuch as the refugee has a right to leave it behind him, and seek freedom elsewhere, if he cannot find it at home, and inasmuch as he has come to Mas­sachusetts, and is within the reach of her protection, he has acquired thereby a right to that protection, and we cannot divest ourselves of the obligation to give it to him.
But then, they tell us the Constitution, nevertheless. What, I ask, is the relative authority of a Constitution that man makes, and a Constitution that God, makes? What is the relative authority of an ab­solute moral obligation, and a mere conventional obligation? One would think there need be no labored answer to questions like these; and there would not be, if men had not suffered their minds to be befogged by the false, teachings of politicians and priests. When Boston pulpits can enunciate the infamous and blasphemous doctrine that we must obey the statutes enacted by a constitutional Legislature, whether wise or unwise, just or unjust, and when the doctrine that there is any Higher Law is repudiated by political parties and scouted by political leaders and denounced as heresy to be punished by political death, it becomes necessary for us to teach the very rudiments of political morality, it becomes necessary for us to tell new truths so plain that, we might almost tremble in the utterance, as insulting the understanding, and moral sense which we address; but so it is. Now I ask-because I do not mean to go at length
<c05>
into this argument-but one question: What is, after all, the source of your obligation to obey the law of the land? Why, you say, because the constituted Legislature has enacted it. But that only puts the question one step further off. What is the source of your obligation to recognize the authority of the constituted Legislature of the land? In other words, what is the source of your obligation to obey an enactment because it is a legislative enactment? Oh, you will tell me, it is your right and duty. The instant you make use of that word duty, you make your appeal to somewhat within me that takes hold of my moral sense, which takes cognizance of duty; and my inquiry is, whether I am bound to obey the dictates of my moral sense or not. If I am not, then no matter how you make it clear that my moral sense requires it, I sweep away the statute and the moral sense together, and tell you it does not please me to obey either. But if, to avoid that conclusion, you say, I am bound to obey the dictates of my moral sense, then I ask you, what must I do with your statute when that conflicts with my moral sense?-and you have already answered me, in assuming that I am bound to obey my own conscientious conviction. That is, you say, that to deny my right or obligation to obey my own conscientious convictions, is virtually to strike at the very foundation of allegiance to your government.
But I pass on to another consideration. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is to be called on, through its Legislature, this winter, to enact that no slave shall be taken back to bondage from its jurisdiction. I can easily suppose that the objection will be urged there which we hear elsewhere-'the Constitution and the Union!' I have shown that the Constitution, where in so ever it conflicts with the moral law, is not and cannot be binding; that it is not only our right but our duty to trample upon it; but I have this further reason, that the party in interest against the claims of justice and humanity has already forfeited even its apparent claim upon the ground of the compact of the Constitution. Whenever men make bargains, they make them with the understanding of mutuality-there is not only a benefit, but an obligation on both sides of the bargain. If I say to you, This farm shall pass into your possession for so much money to pass into mine, and you give me your note of hand and receive the deed, when the time comes for the payment of the note of hand, if you refuse to pay it, I am under no obligation any longer to recognize your right to the property, but have a right to use such means as will be effectual to bring that property back into my possession; or, if the note is to be paid before the deed is given, I have a right to refuse the deed. (Applause.) You all understand the principle well enough, and I think you already know enough of our relations to the Slave Power to see the application of that principle in the case before us. The bargain, we are told, was this; that for certain considerations, we of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will give up to the slaveholder his fugitive from slavery. Well, so the bond, if it do not exactly so read, has been, by common consent, interpreted. But, in the first place, the bargain rested upon these considerations-that, whatever rights were guaranteed to us in the Constitution, we shall be permitted to enjoy without molestation; and, second, (if not expressed, yet necessarily implied in the absence of any terms-extending the obligations further,) that we should not be obliged to surrender slaves carried from any part of the earth that was not covered by the terms of the compact, Now, in both of these particulars, the Slave Power has violated the terms of its compact, and has thus released us from our obligation, if it were possible that a compact so immoral could impose any obligation at the beginning. The slaveholders have not been true to the terms of the bargain we made. The Constitution has guaranteed to us the privileges and immunities of citizenship, go where we will within the compass of this Union. If I go to Carolina, I am a citizen of the United States, and, by virtue of my citizenship, I have a right to free speech and a free press, and to use my moral and religious influence in favor of whatever my moral and religious nature tells me I ought to endeavor to promote. I have a right, then-just as good a right in Carolina as in Massachusetts-to assail slavery with all the weapons of the moral armory; I have a right to call upon the people of the South, in the name of justice and Christianity, in the name of humanity, in the name of sound policy, in the name of good economy, to abolish the slave system; I have a right to say that it is unjust, Anti­Christian and inhuman, and that it is emphatically uneconomical; I have a right to show its waste of the energies of the people, its waste of the resources of national wealth, its violation of the essential rights of human nature, its opposition to the laws of God and the teachings of Christ. Can I do it? Will Carolina let me do it? I go there with the Constitution spread all over me as my shield of protection, I go there with my legal rights piled up before me as an impregnable fortress of defence, and one breath dissolves it into nothingness, and crumbles the parchment into thin particles of impalpable vapor. Where is my constitutional protection, if I dare to speak for humanity, for truth, for justice in a court of justice? If I dare to undertake the application of Christianity to the daily life of Carolina, if I even dare to quote 'Poor Richard's Almanac,' in application to the wasteful and desolating system of slavery, I do it at the peril of my life; and the very best fate I can hope is the privilege of going into instant banishment from the territory of the sovereign empire of Carolina. Well, I come home to Massachusetts, and the next day,-having been ban­ished by Carolina from her soil, in defiance of the terms of the compact,-I turn round and catch Anthony Burns, and tying him hands and feet, hurry him back into Carolina bondage! Even waiving the question of the original immorality of the compact, am I bound, having been robbed of the benefits that were to accrue to me, still to bear all the burdens that were imposed upon me? I tell you, no.
I might go on and recite one particular after another in which the Constitution has been violated by the Slave Power, not under the influence of passion, not in moments of high excitement, but deliberately, systematically, on a preconcerted plan, and with, an unanimity that speaks the Slave Power so complete as to leave no possible doubt of entire harmony of
<c06>
sympathy and feeling, and concert of purpose and action.
Now, who will tell me, in the face of these undeniable facts, that might be piled one upon another-like Pelion upon Ossa, until the whole land should be shadowed by the very darkness which would brood over it,-who will tell me that, nevertheless, we are bound to abide by the terms of the Constitution?
But, as I said, the Constitution carries with it another obligation on the part of the pro-slavery party, and that is, not to attempt to stretch its application beyond the limits originally understood. Yet the Slave Power has done that. It has carried to Texas what was meant only for the Atlantic States; it has carried over to the territory of Louisiana, and the States carved and to be carved out of it, and it is trying to carry to Cuba, and Nicaragua, and Sonora, and I know not how many other provinces and islands of continent and sea, that obligation which was originally understood as limited within definite boundaries. Now it has no definite boundaries. The domain of slavery is bound only by the possibility of slavery-extension. If you know where that limit is, then you can tell me what is the limit to which the Slave Power would carry the obligation to five back runaway slaves, and to do whatever other pro-slavery work it sees fit to exact from us. I deny the competency of one of the parties to a compact to extend the application of its terms in this manner. But if you tell me that it is not extended simply by the action of one party, but by the consent of all parties; if you tell me that, although Texas was admitted unconstitutionally, and Louisiana obtained unconstitutionally, (so admitted by Jefferson himself, when he made the purchase,) yet the North has made the act constitutional by tacit consent, by the ratification of acquiescence, I answer, very well; I grant it, for the sake of the argument; but then, what follows? Why, that we are not living under the Constitution our fathers made in 1787 to 1789; that we are not living under the Constitution which Washington administered and Jefferson violated when he bought Louisiana; which, if it had been in force, Polk would have trampled under foot when he admitted Texas, in defiance of the Constitution, which confers the privilege of admitting new States upon Congress and nut upon the Executive. In these various acts to which allusion has been made, the old Constitution of the fathers was clearly set aside, and either that Constitution is binding now,-and if it is, all those acts are unconstitutional and void,-or that old Constitution is not binding now, by virtue of the existence of a new one, and then it follows, that the obligations incurred by the old one do not rest upon us now. I say, it strict truth, we are not living under a Constitution made in 1787 to '89; I say, when the Slave Power made demands which the Constitution did not warrant, it virtually proposed a new Constitution, and when the North acquiesced in the proposition, it virtually adopted a new Constitution; and so we have had one Constitution made after another, each, perhaps, more ample in its concessions to slavery, in certain directions, than the other, but certainly neither carrying any obligation which is dependent on the original compact. Now, if any body does not choose to accede to any of the new terms, of course he is not bound to obey the new Constitution. When Louisiana was admitted to the Union, the North acquiesced, and a new Constitution was made. That lasted until Missouri asked admission. There was nothing in the original Constitution that contemplated the admission of territory west of the Mississippi. The single fact that the Constitution did not confer the power on any department of the government to admit new territory is sufficient evidence that such admission was not in the contemplation of the people; and who will tell me that the people gave the power to do that which they never contemplated doing, and gave it without assigning any repository that should receive it? Who could acquire new territory? Not the Executive, not the Judiciary, not the Legislative-not all together. There was no place where that power was put, and therefore we may reasonably infer that the people never meant to give the power, and it never was conferred. Well, we have a new Constitution tendered to us in the proposal to take Missouri into the Union; the North, after some contest, yield the point, and the new Constitution is ratified; and we have at least the third Constitution since the old Articles of Confederation were adopted. Then comes the attempt (overlooking all the out rages of the Slave Power in the mean time) to bring Texas into the Union-an attempt which it was then believed would have signally failed if it had been pursued in a constitutional way, and therefore it was consummated in a glaringly unconstitutional way; the North acquiesced, and we had our fourth Constitution made for us.
Now, if the South may go on tendering to as new Constitutions, here for the sake of getting Louisiana, there to acquire Texas, yonder to crowd slavery into Kansas, in defiance of the three previous Constitutions, pray may we not also make our tender of terms for a new compact? The South has made a new Constitution just as often as it has suited her own interests. Let us take that precedent, and say to the South, 'We have the offer of a new Constitution to make to you. It shall provide that whenever a man shall set his foot upon the soil of a State when slavery is not sanctioned by the local law, he shall be a free man; there shall be no chase after him, there shall be no dragging him back from thence; he shall be protected in his rights like any other inhabitant.' If the South chooses to acquiesce, there is no ham done. We have a right to procure other terms than those of the compact. You bargain to build me a house, with certain specifications, for a certain sum of money. You begin your work, get tired of your bargain, and come to me with proposed changes of the specification. I acquiesce. You are no longer bound by the terms of the first bargain, neither am I, and I have a right to say that the price shall be varied. Massachusetts has a right to take this ground, that there shall be no slave existing on her soil; and if that is contrary to the fourth, fifth. tenth or twentieth Constitution which has been made by claims on one side and acquiesced in on the other, all I have to say is, 'You may take your choice, accept the terms we propose, or refuse to accept them, and then we will no longer hold you to the terms of the old bargain, but
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
The United Station Constitution is 'a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell.'
‘The free States are the guardians and essential supports of slavery. We are the jailers and constables of the institution. These is some excuse for communities, when, under a generous impulse, they espouse the cause of the oppressed in other States, and by force restore their rights; but they are without excuse in aiding other States in binding on men an unrighteous yoke. On this subject, OUR FASATHERS, IN FRAMING THE CONSTITUTION, SWERVED FROM THE right. We their children, at the end of half a century, see the path of duty more clearly than they, and 'must walk tm it. To this point the public mind has long been tending, and the time has come for looking at it fully, dispassionately, and with manly and Christian resolution. No blessing of the Union can be a compensation for taking part in the enslaving of our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to be perpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that it can only continue through our participation in wrong doing. To this conviction the free States are tending.'-William Ellery CHANNING.

will just stand aloof from all complicity with the wickedness you practise.ï¿½ Have we not the right to do this; and if we hare reason to believe that the South Will acquiesce, what is there for the politician to be afraid of, or the office-seeker to tremble at? But if we bare reason to believe that the South will not acquiesce, what then? Why, then we meet, distinctly set before us this alternative: either to continue in the Union, on condition of participating in the atrocious crime of slaveholding and slavery-abetting, or shun the crime by withdrawing from the Union.
(Loud applause.)
Now, I want to know who is ready to meet that alternative in any other way than that which we propose: The excuse which men make continually is. that there it no need of participating in slavery became we remain in the Union. One man says, ï¿½I donï¿½t leave the Union, because the Constitution is anti-slaveryï¿½; another says, ï¿½I donï¿½t leave the Union, because I donï¿½t feel under any obligation to obey the United States pro-slavery Constitution where it requires me to do wrong, and therefore I may stay in the Union, and not stain my soul with the blood of the slave.ï¿½ If this is true, then the argument against the measure which we propose falls to the ground; if it is not true, then the assumption U a lie upon the face of it; and we leave it to those who cling to the Union to select which horn of the dilemma they will hang themselves upon, during the present session of the Legislature. There is no escaping from one or the other of them.
I have yet one word more to say, which I think worth saying, notwithstanding the length of time I have occupied already. I go to the people of Massachusetts, and I ask them, one by one, if you please, in the confidence of social communion by the fireside ï¿½What do you think of catching runaway slaves?ï¿½ ï¿½Think of it! It is abominable. No man shall be taken from my house.ï¿½ So says one. Says another ï¿½I will help him to the utmost of my ability. I never mean to permit the recapture at a fugitive, if I can help it.ï¿½ Among the Berkshire hills, in the Hampshire valley, along the banks of the Connecticut, in the heart of the Commonwealth, down here upon the shores of Essex and Plymouth and Barnstable, wherever I go, they tell me, ï¿½We donï¿½t mean to permit a slave to be taken away from our soil again. They got away Anthony Burns because they had the neighborhood of the Navy Yard, and the cannon and bayonets of the United States marines to help them; but these will not aid them any where else. Let them get away from the convenient vicinage of Charlestown Navy Yard, and they will try in vain to take any man from the soil of Massachusetts Now, I am not inquiring whether that proud boast will be verified in the day of trial; that is not essential to the argument; all I have to any is that in these declaration we learn the settled purpose of the people of Massachusetts not to permit the capture of runaway slaves, They do not mean to do it, let the Constitution be what it may. Let Judge Taney or Judge Shaw say what he pleases, let Benj. F. Hallett and his brother Commissioners do whatever dirty work they find congenial to their souls, and let Benj. R. Curtis, with whatever congeniality there is in him, ratify the work, the people of Massachusetts do not mean to let the slave be taken back to bondage.(Loud cheers.)
This, of itself, is a distinct, and, as at seems to me, potent argument; one strong link in the chain by which I would bind your consciences and your hearts to the deed I ask of you this day. If, I say, the people of Massachusetts, from the hills of Berkshire to the sands of Cape Cod, from the borders of the Green Mountain State to the line of the Connecticut, do not mean to send back the runaway slave, or permit him to be sent back,ï¿½if they mean to shelter him, to feed him, to hide him, and speed him on his way to Canada, if he cannot be safe hereï¿½in other words, if they mean to violate what they acknowledge to be a provision of the Constitution,-if they mean to transgress what they understand to be the requirements of the statute,-if they mean to tread under foot the precedents of the Supreme Court, and of the inferior Courts, then what right have they to lie to the South, and to lie to the world, even though that lie should cover ten pages of the statute-book with a veil of circumlocutions that darken counsel by words without knowledge? (Cheers.) What right have they to say they will do the thing somehow, which they do not mean to do anyhow?ï¿½that the only difficulty there is, is about the mode, when in the heart of them they know the difficulty is about the thing? Why not be honest, manly? Why not be frank and open? Why not speak out to the world what they cherish in their own hearts? Is it not time to verify the declaration of Scripture, ï¿½that what is spoken in the ear, shall be proclaimed from the house-topï¿½? Is it not time for us to get hold here of the two Massachusetts extremities of the Underground Railroad, and lift it up into daylight? (Loud applause.) Nay, is it not time to go yet a little further than that, and break the connection between the Underground Railroad of Massachusetts and that of Vermont or New Hampshire, and establish here the terminus, right under the shadow of your State House? (Enthusiastic cheering.) Let that granite obelisk yonder upon Bunker Hill be the boundary that says ï¿½Hitherto, but no further!ï¿½ Nay, rather, only to him who comes along the ocean track let this be the terminus, but just as soon as the land traveller crosses the line of Connecticut, and the air of Massachusetts breathes into the open windows of the car, let it be understood the journey is ended.(Renewed applause.)
Is not that the true response to the demands of the Slave Power for larger concessions to slavery, when, with Chief Justice Taney for her mouthpiece, she asks you to permit her to carryï¿½no, not asks you to permit her, but insolently demands that you accede to, her claimï¿½a claim not included in the terms of the Constitution-to carry her slaves all over the Free States,ï¿½to Bunker Hill and Faneuil Hall, to every place consecrated by the blood of freemen, and sacred to the memories of the pastï¿½demands the right of carrying slaves wherever she will, and of holding them as property whatever they are borne-is not this the true response: ï¿½No man shall be recognized as property on the soil of Massachusetts; no man shall be taken as property from the soil of Massachusetts!ï¿½ The people mean it, the people desire it, the people have deliberately purposed it in their heart of, hearts, and why should they not say so? That is the avowal of each of the parties, and of all, taken singly; why should it not be the avowal of all, speaking collectively? Lest the voice of the Commonwealth, expressed through an many organs of speech, should fail to reach the ears of the farthest South, why not utter it in one grand organ blast through the trump of your Legislature? Carolina, Florida, Texas, can hear that, for they tremble sometimes at even its faintest whisperings.
But the argument is not complete by this statement of it; and so I go back to the starting-point by the next statement which I make. I ask all these people of Massachusetts who tell me that they do not mean to give up a runaway slave, ï¿½What, do you dare disobey a law of the land?ï¿½ You are ï¿½a law-abiding people.ï¿½ I have learned that from your earliest history. It is in the very bones and blood of your Anglo-Saxon race to be ï¿½a law-abiding people.ï¿½ A-Saxon man is only a section of a circle, a fraction of an integer, and the recognition of the State is essential to his completeness, and he acknowledges its authority accordingly. He is ï¿½a law-abidingï¿½ man. Bat, some how, you nave come into a position hare which reveals another side of that Saxon character. You are practically contemning the law; doing it secretly, if you will, not because you are ashamed to do it openly, but because only so can you do it effectively; you say that you do not go about this work of charity and mercy and humanity and justice, In the manner one would go about robbing hen-roosts and stealing sheep, because you think there is any thing germane in such transactions, but because so only can you make the
<c02>
benefit effectual that you desire to confer. Very good; then comes my questionï¿½ï¿½Law-abiding as you are,ï¿½constitutionally, traditionally, educationally, habitually law-abiding as you are, why do yon now break away from the ties which Constitution and tradition and education and habit hare imposed upon you, and tread the law under your feet, break away from the constitutional requirements, and give liberty to him whom law and Constitution hare branded as a chattel and property? There is but just one answer you can make; there is but just one answer which measures itself adequately with the terms of the question, and that isï¿½Conscienceï¿½God! Yon know it as well as I. ï¿½God and Conscience will not let us do otherwise. We are not law-abiding, because we are law-abiding. We are not abiding by the lower law, because we are cognizant of the higher.ï¿½(Applause.)
There, then, I leave you, where I began. I began by showing you that this compact is rat binding by reason of its immorality; I conclude by showing you that you feel it not to be binding by reason of your consciousness of its immorality.
At the last session of the annual meeting of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, on Friday evening, Jan. 28th, addresses were delivered by Mrs. Caroline M. Severance, Wm. Lloyd Garrison, and Wendell Phillips. That of Mrs. S. we shall print next week: the two last we give below.

SPEECH OF WM. LLOYD GARRISON.
MR. PRESIDENT,ï¿½The story of the Good Samaritan has come down to us from the put centuries, and will go down to the end of time; and every where will be accepted by the judgment, and conscience and heart of man, as the best exposition and proof of the love of God that can be shown. ï¿½Heï¿½s true to God whoï¿½s true to man.ï¿½ It was a very simple and pertinent interrogation of old, ï¿½He that loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he hath not seen?ï¿½ My friend, Mr. Wright, omitted one remarkable feature of that transaction. He forgot to say that the crowning excellence of the conduct of the Good Samaritan was this,ï¿½that the man whom he succored and saved was his enemy. The Jews had no dealings with the Samaritans. Would not that Samaritan have been justified in also turning aside, like the Jewish priest an Levite, and refusing to give any aid? Nay; though the wounded traveller was an enemyï¿½a bitter and most implacable enemyï¿½he never seems to have thought of it, but went to him just as if he had been a brother Samaritan. I take this to be the sublime of moral action, and the grand feature which makes that story so touching and soul-subduing. Certainly, in the judgment of the Jewish nation, that Samarium was a heretic and infidel. As for Jesus himself, who was no Samaritan, but a Jew by birth, we know very well in what estimation he was held by those who represented the religion of the day, who claimed to have Abraham for their father. We know that they put him to death on the ground of his exceeding wickedness. The charge was clear and distinct:ï¿½ï¿½This man is not of God; he keepeth not the Sabbath day.ï¿½ And then, in regard to his wonderful works, remember that he was accused of ï¿½casting out Beelzebub by Beelzebubï¿½; and they said, ï¿½He hath a devilï¿½; and they said, also. ï¿½We have heard his blasphemy:ï¿½what need have we of further witnesses Let him be crucified.ï¿½ Now, that noble and heroic soul said, once for all, in reference to those who should follow in his footsteps, ï¿½If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they all them of his household?ï¿½ And an apostle, himself accounted as ï¿½the filth of the earth, the offscouring of all things,ï¿½ for Jesusï¿½ sake, also said, in the hearing of all posterity, for the comfort and edification of all heroic and brave spirits suffering for righteousnessï¿½ sakeï¿½ï¿½If we suffer with Christ, we shall also reign with him.
Infidels, are we? Yes, in the popular acceptation of the term. But then, when we learn what that is, instead of its being a reproach, it is a laurel that any man may be proud to put around his brow; for to be a Christian, popularly, means to be a sneak, a coward, a trimmer, a formalist, or a hypocriteï¿½one who goes with the multitude to do evilï¿½one who is ï¿½on the side of the oppressor, where there is power,ï¿½ and became there is power;ï¿½that is to be a Christian in this country, as Christianity is now interpreted and recognized. (Applause.) Now, to expose it, to repudiate it, is of course to be guilty of infidelity. Well, that is to be manly, heroic, and uncompromising for the truth. I would not, for the world, be recognized as a Christian, in the popular sense. I should feel that I ought to hang my head for shame, if that appellation were conceded to me, in the midst of universal religious degeneracy.
Sir, we have been accused of attacking the Church of Christ. We have done no such thing. Why should. we? We have no controversy with that Church, for it is the Church of Freedom. It has for its head, Christ the Redeemer, and we have no controversy with Redemption; that is our object. Christ came to open the prison-doors, and set the captives free; that is our mission. Why should we have any controversy with a Church which is all rightï¿½into which no tyrant ever yet was permitted to enter, although many a poor slave, in spite of the tyrant, has been taken to its embrace? Sir, it is time for us to look at the assumptions of these organized bodies, which undertake to awe us down, to padlock our lips, to frighten the timid and Unreflecting with the cry of ï¿½infidelity.ï¿½ It is an easy thing for any one to say, ï¿½Our organization is the true churchï¿½; equally easy is it to say, ï¿½I am a Christian.ï¿½ A very different thing is it to be one; and a very different thing is the true Church.
The true Churchï¿½what is it? Can men band themselves together, and say, ï¿½Go to! Voted, we are the true Church,ï¿½ï¿½and make themselves such? No, sir, it is not made in that way. These church organizationsï¿½I deny their arrogant assumption, that they are holy organizations, Heaven-derived, instead of man-made. Why, sir, a man may go round the earth, and join every so-called religious organization that he ran find, and he will not then hare joined the true Church. One of the cheering results of this conflict with a false Church has been the opening of the eyes of thousands to see that they have been deluded in supposing that God requires them to join any outward organization, or that any such is that Church, ï¿½against which the gates of hell shall never prevail.ï¿½ These petty corporations, putting on such divine airs! And yet asking permission of the State to exist, and to have granted to them the right to sue and be sued!ï¿½ How divine is all that! (Laughter and applause.) And you and I must take care how we impeach or rebuke any of these corporations! It is a holy Churchï¿½it is the Church of Christ! No, sir, it is not; it is only another edition of Romeï¿½a pocket edition. (Laughter.) It is edifying to see with what unanimity the various Protestant sects arrive at the conclusion, that the Romish Church is the ï¿½mother of harlots.ï¿½ Pray, who are her daughters, that have sprung from her loins, if they be not these corrupt Protestant sects? (Loud applause.) I accept their testimony as to their mother; for, knowing their origin, and their character, I am sure that they are her daughters. (Renewed applause.) The only difference between them is, she is old and haggard, and thoroughly diseased, and they are young and buxom in their wantonnessï¿½that is all. (Continued applause.)
The true Churchï¿½it is not organized flesh and blood. The true Churchï¿½there is no outward power that can put it down, because it is spiritual. But who will say that these petty organizations cannot be scattered to the winds of heaven, when empires disappear, when every thing is mutable beneath the skies, in the matter of association and combination? The true Church is in the hearts of true believers; of those who love man, and therefore love God; and that Church will stand.
<c03>
So, sir, even if it were true that we have brought unjust accusations against the Methodist Church, or he Presbyterian Church, or the Baptist Church, or my other organized body, in this long-protracted conflict, it don not follow that we hare assailed the true Church. But then, we have not unjustly accused any of teem. You remember the story of the man who came into his house one day in a great rage, and said to his wife, I have just been called a scoundrel oat here.ï¿½ Oh,ï¿½ said his wife, ï¿½donï¿½t mind it,ï¿½ ï¿½Well,ï¿½ said he, I wouldï¿½nt, if the man had not proved it on the spot.ï¿½ (Laughter.) So here the pinch is; our charge! Are true, and cannot be refuted; for we have exaggerated nothing, nor ï¿½set down anght in malice.
Understand, then, friends of freedom, that the soul is not to be in bondage to any religious organization. It is tree to stand where it pleases, outside or inside, where it can with a clear conscience, and with no compromise of principle. This being so, we call upon those who are giving their support to a pro-slavery Church to come out, and shake off the dust of their feet upon it, and stand erect on the side of humanity.
I thank God that the scope of Anti-Slavery is boundless; that there is nothing which pertains to the intellect, heart, soul, or interests of man, that is not wrapped up in this movement. (Applause.) Slavery is the annihilation of all human rights, and therefore of all human interests.
Mr. President, every great reform is a great religious movement, in the best sense of the term. We see this very clearly in regard to the past. We go back to Abraham and Moses, to Isaiah and Jeremiah, to Jesus and Peter and Paul, to Wickliffe an Huss, to Luther and Melancthon, to Wesley and Fox, to the Puritan fathersï¿½we go back to those old heretics, dissenters and infidels, and gratefully honor and reverence them as eminently religious, while we regard their persecutors and traducers with abhorrence. This Anti-Slavery movement, though everywhere denounced as infidel, shall be hailed by posterity as one of the most [extraordinary and deeply religious movements that the world has ever known, and mea will draw inspiration from it in all coming time. If we continue faithful in this work, others coming after us will be made faithful through us to the duties of their age. If we are brave and heroic, and meet the demands of the times unflinchingly, men a thousand years hence shall derive strength from our example. What incentives for a man to be loyal to right and duty! The power that is in him, the effluence that goes out of him, the result of his thought or actï¿½he may not be able to compute it, to follow it, or to measure it, but it shall go circling round the globe, and down from one generation to another, blessing, and strengthening, and elevating, and saving multitudes (Loud applause.) It is a mighty stimulus to think what we may do, however humble. It is the deed, not the man; it is being in the right, when the multitude are in the wrong.
What a change since the Anti-slavery cause was launched! Then, the American church and clergy were high above usï¿½proud, haughty, defiant, looking down with scorn and contempt upon our movement. Now, they are in many cases brought down upon their knees, begging not to be too severely dealt with, endeavoring to prove that they are anti-slavery, and entreating us to believe that they are ï¿½as much opposed to slaveryï¿½ as we are. They beg us not to crowd them to the wall. This is a great change of tone and position.
Mr. President, I wanted to say a word in regard to the specific work which is before us in the Old Bay State. Last autumn, I was in Vermont, among the Green Mountains, with my friend Mr. May, endeavoring to confer with the people on this great question. We travelled from place to place, and urged the importance and duty of circulating petitions to be presented to the Legislature of Vermont, asking that body to decree the emancipation of every slave coming into that State. Wherever we spoke, this suggestion met with the heartiest response. The oneness of sentiment was remarkable. There were only a few weeks, however, before the Legislature would come together; but petitions were printed as speedily as possible, circulated, and numerously signed, and then sent to that body; and to the surprise, I think, even of the most hopeful, the Legislature promptly responded to the very letter of the petition! (Applause.) Certainly, it is a most remarkable spectacleï¿½Vermont leading the way, and by statute declaring, that no matter how a slave may get within her limits, whether he be brought there by his master, or flee there for his own safety, he becomes a freeman; and whoever shall dare to molest him must suffer for it. (Applause.) That is the sublimest act of legislation in the history of the United States. I told the people of Vermont at that time, that they might, if they could, anticipate Massachusetts. I did not then believe they could; but they have done it. All honor to the Green Mountain boys! I believe they will standby it. (Loud cheers.)
Well, sir, it will be honor enough for Massachusetts if she will say ditto to Vermont. And will she say so? ï¿½What do you think?ï¿½ says one; ï¿½shall we carry it?ï¿½ ï¿½I do not know,ï¿½ is my reply. ï¿½Well, how many petitions have been sent in?ï¿½ ï¿½I do not know.ï¿½ ï¿½How many yet remain to be sent?ï¿½ ï¿½I do not know.ï¿½ But I do know that a great deal depends upon the popular demonstration as to what the Legislature will do in regard to a measure so important as this. I believe there is great unanimity of feeling among the people in this matter; and I want the members of the Legislature to see, from certain petitions that the will go into them, what is the state of public sentiment generally in Massachusetts, and not doubt that the Commonwealth is ready for just such a law as Vermont has placed upon her statute-book.
There is one thing, in connection with this subject, that is very remarkable, and that is, the entire silence on the part of the press in regard to this matter. Your editors are very courageous men, are they not? They want to know a little more as to the exact state of public feeling before they speak out. Not one single journal in the Commonwealth, except the Liberator, has noticed the fact that this effort is going on to nullify the Fugitive Slave Law, and make Massachusetts Canada to every fugitive slave. Do you say that that fact is rather ominous of defeat? No; it is ominous of victory; for the old maxim, I think, holds good in this caseï¿½ï¿½Silence gives consent.ï¿½(Applause.) At any rate, there is no dissent, and we may take it for granted, therefore, that the press is so conscious of the present state of public sentiment in Massachusetts on this question, that, if it has the disposition, it dare not, as a matter of policy, oppose this effort. I think this is a very encouraging sign of the times.
But we may not succeed this year, though I am going to assume that we shall. If we do not, we shall know precisely what we have got to do. Go to work again; once more into the deadly imminent breach;ï¿½ once more to canvassing the Commonwealth, in a more systematic and thorough manner than it has been done in our late effort. Massachusetts must be free soil to all who stand upon it. If we have to take the State House down, brick by brick, this decree must be made. (Loud applause.) We need not concern ourselves greatly with Georgia, Carolina, or Alabama. Let them go, if you will, until the Bay State liberates every fugitive slave within her borders; and then, I think, a staggering blow will be given to the slave system of the South. Massachusetts will wheel into line with Vermont; the Empire State is taming in the same direction; Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and other States will follow, for the flame is spreading from State to State, and the spirit becoming universal for the same object. We are yet to have a North, and it is to be a gloriously free North, on the Mil of which no slavehunter shall ever dare to plant his feet, and upon which every slave shall find his emancipation. (Loud cheers.)

SPEECH OF WENDELL PHILLIPS, ESQ MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that if you will allow me the merit of introducing so good a speech, [alluding to the speech of Gov. Robinson, of Kansas,] I need not make one myself. At any rate, as all governors, when they visit the college from which they graduated, are complimented with the degree of Doctor of Laws, I think we should be willing to confer it upon GOT. Robinson. (Laughter and applause) And, indeed, if yon were to throw in the degree of Doctor of Divinity, I should not object, for his divinity is about as good as we usually get. (Renewed applause) I think the testimony which he has given us relative to the people of Kansas goes to sustain the wisdom of the philosophy that has been laid down, time and again, from this platform. We are not to expect, from a comparatively rude community, yet in the gristle, not hardened into the bone of manhood, not knowing each other, not running in the grooves of familiar institutionsï¿½we, are not to expect from them, certainly, any greater advance in a radical, philosophical construction of Government, than from old established institutions like ours in Massachusetts. It was always to me a fair excuse, offered to me as far West as I ever went, in Iowa, when they said, ï¿½Set us the example in Massachusetts. You have more leisure and more leisurely men; you have more disciplined, educated, and farsighted men than we have; yon have an older average population; it becomes you to set the example we will follow you.ï¿½ When these young States want to make a code of laws, what do they do? They take the statute book of one of the New England States as their model. When we send out a code of laws, it is a light to all these States. That is the reason why the petition that has been named here gains addition al weight, every word of it, from the testimony which Gov. Robinson has given of the state of things in Kansas. We want to stereotype Massachusettsï¿½ example for these young States; we want to show them what can be peaceably and safely done, for they naturally look to us.
In that connection, allow me to mention another thing. I want to thank our friend Everett for throwing the religious element into the discussion, and for bringing us back to the point from whence we started. I spoke this morning of the petition from Georgetown, and stated that that large number of names was obtained by the exertions of one of the everpresent Beecher familyï¿½Rev. Charles Beecher. I was mistaken. It was a humble citizen, one Moses Wright, who took the blank petition, and then, on: his own responsibility and agency, presented it to the clergyman and his wife, who signed it, and then, by his own hard labor, from time to time, sought, in his own house or place of business, each one of the four or five hundred persons whose names he secured, by dint of earnest effort, backed by a life that looked over his shoulders, and sent us that most honorable petition. (Applause) Now that is a Moses worth having; and I believe in his plenary inspiration. (Laughter and applause) I wish to do justice to that man; for it is hard work to carry round one of those petitions. I honor the moral intrepidity of the man who takes his whole town by the throat, and makes it do its duty. But look at that petition. Men shrink from it; the Legislature, it is said, may shrink from it. But you cannot find a man in the Commonwealth,ï¿½unless it be South-side Adams, and I do not think quite so bad even of him,ï¿½who, when you put it to him as an individual, as a Christian, as a man, alone on the sidewalk, would respond to you that he himself, in his own person, would assist in the return of a fugitive slave. I have yet to find that man or woman among the millions of the men and women of Massachusetts. I do not know that he can be found. Why, here was a distinguished judge on the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States, who went down and argued the question in Faneuil Hall, that we all ought to obey t ho Fugitive Slave Law; yet it was privately reported that at that very hour he had come himself from the Christian duty of smuggling his own black servant into Canada. (Applause) I have a friend and relative settled in the city of Brooklyn, New York. He was surprised one night to find at his door a clergyman of that city, hurried, anxious, breathless, whom he recognized as the preacher of one of the most lauded sermons in support of the Fugitive Slave Bill, and which the Journal of Commerce had praised week after week. There he stood, under the portico of my friend, also a clergyman, and as soon as he could get breath to speak, he said, ï¿½What do you do with these black people? I have got a fugitive woman at my house; I donï¿½t know the steps to be taken, but she must be got to Canada.ï¿½ Stuttering with impatience, hardly able to art culate, confusing his words and questions, and only anxious that he should not lose a moment to give the officers an opportunity to seize the fugitive who had knocked at his door for mercy, and found it, because he had a heart that was not hide-bound by his theology. (Applause.) I say it is a singular fact, that you cannot find an individual in the State who is willing to say that he would assist in returning a fugitive slave.
Mrs. FOSTER rose to correct the speaker. She said that the City Marshal of Worcester, Wm. S. Lincoln, and a dozen others in that city, had raid again and again, that they would aid in the return of a fugitive slave, when called upon.
Mr. PHILLIPS.ï¿½I have one or two remarks to make upon that. You remember that story of the Cape Cod captain who had a steamer that run from Hyannis to Nantucket, and in the cabin was a notice that no gentleman was expected to spit on the carpet. One day the captain went up to a man, and remonstrated with him for disregarding the notice. ï¿½Lord, captain,ï¿½ said he, ï¿½I aint a gentleman. ï¿½I am not sure that a United States Marshal comes up to my statement when I said no man. (Hoars of laughter and applause.) Then, again, you remember that inimitable chapter in Mrs. Stoweï¿½s novel, where a State Senator, away off in Michigan somewhere, who had been making a very patriotic speech, and declared what he was ready to do, and how willingly he would do it, and summoned his fellow-citizens to his side, went home and found that his wife had hidden a fugitive slave in her room, looked in her face, and caved in.ï¿½ I am not sure that Marshal Lincoln would not do the same. I knew his brother when he was a boy, and he had a heart; and I am not sure that the Marshal would stand fire. But if he did, lie is only one; and I have no doubt, now I think of it, that there may be, now and then oneï¿½I had forgotten Hallett and Gushing, and several others. (Laughter and applause.) But what I mean is, the general remark holds true, that out of a million of men and women, you would not find a thousand, you would not find anything but the most (in two senses) despicable minority, who would consent to such an act; and everybody, (an immense majority, at any rate,) would be ashamed of it.
Now, the inference I was going to draw is this: When the State assembles as a State, why should it not enunciate for law what is the heart-sentiment of at least nine hundred thousand out of the million? I believe we do not utter foolish speeches when we prophecy, that when we have eight or nine hundred thousand out of a million on our side, it will not be long before we stereotype these pulses into statutes. I cannot believe that it can be. long delayed. This Legislature may not do it; the next Legislature may not do it. When they have done it, it is possible that the Supreme Court may stand, as I said, like a Gibraltar against it. I have no feeling of disrespect towards the Supreme Court; but you know John Quincy Adams told, when they threatened him with such an institution in Congress, the old story of the Chelsea doctor in England whose place was given to another, in case of his deathï¿½the way they manage those things in England. The young man went down to look at the place, and as he was walking in the garden, the old gentleman went up to him and said, ï¿½Young man, I am not fifty yet; my father lived to be ninety,
<c05>
my mother ninety-six, and my grandfather almost a hundred.ï¿½ ï¿½Sir,ï¿½ replied the young man, ï¿½I can wait.ï¿½ (Laughter tad applause.) So we can wait, until the Supreme Court gets ready to obey the State, or the State gets ready to dispense with the Supreme Court. (Loud applause.)
One way or another, in this age, and in these institutions, the people get their will. I believe, for instance, that the slave trade will be reestablished. Why? I do not thinkï¿½at least I am hardly fearful that the Congress of the United States will, by formal enactment, proclaim its own shame, and repeal the statute against piracy. I do not believe, on the other hand, that the wealthy men who bread slaves, or hold them in the Carolinas and Virginia, where they are worth, on an avenge, a thousand dollars a head, will aid a scheme that is going to introduce slaves at four or five hundred dollars a head. But I do not believe that either this wealthy class, or the reluctance of Congress to repeal its statute, will defeat the pecuniary interest, filibustering ambition, fire-eating recklessness and love of adventure, of lounging thousands in the Southern States, who have nothing to do. I believe that, as you can always smuggle goods when the profit is forty per cent., a fortiori, you can smuggle goods in the broad light of day, when the profit is three hundred per cent. Look at the case of the ï¿½Wanderer.ï¿½ The U. S. Marshal of South Carolina, after the press of that State has proclaimed that the captain of the ï¿½Wandererï¿½ ought to be welcomed as a deliverer, not tried as a criminal, announces that if the captain surrenders himself, he (the Marshal] will not deliver him up to the authorities of Georgia, on requisition, but will try him himself; and then the complacent captain surrenders himself, having had the pledge of the Government that he shall not suffer! How clearly that one fact indicates the state of public opinion at the South!
Now, how are we to act? It seems to me that we may sayï¿½the phrase I was about to quote reminds me of another thing. I cannot stand here, and watch the hands of yonder clock, warning me that the last moments of this Anniversary are approaching, without remembering one so often with us, and whose voice has so long thrilled the heart of the Commonwealth with a brave and pure eloquence, owning am wielding an inevitable weight to which few men can lay claim. Sickness parts him from us to-night, seals those wise lips for the present, bids that untiring brain be still, takes from the slaveï¿½s coffer the wealth of that rich freighted intellect, takes from his side the strength of that sturdy right arm, and sends Theodore Parker to softer climes; whence soon, with Godï¿½s blessing, he shall come,ï¿½turning our prayers into thanksgiving, and making glad every heart that loves liberty and struggles to save the race,ï¿½with restored strength arid his wonted vigor to lead and to labor, as he has done, so generously, so efficiently, and with such abundant fruits of his ministry for so many years. I cannot remember it without trying to give expression, feebly, at the moment, to what your hearts would say so much better, how profoundly we appreciate all he has done, how sorely we shall lack his aid, how deeply we shall feel his absence, with what longing we shall wait his return.
Suppose I turn aside to criticise another thing in this connection. A man of as generous a heart, his tongue touched with a kindred eloquence, but fettered by a fellowship with men-stealers, fighting up like a thunder-storm against the overwhelming suspicion and the black clouds that settle, deservedly, on his sect, who has never sunderel the ties that compromise his position, and whose trumpet gives so often an uncertain sound,ï¿½such a man thinks it worth his whileï¿½he forgets himself enoughï¿½to apologize to a boy or bigot criticï¿½he, free to frequent drunken revels in honor of old poets or of New England anniversaries, and when blamed, deigning no answer,ï¿½he so much forgot their relative places, that when God helped him once to cut loose a moment from his black associates, and, like a white dove, mount to the clear blue of Theodore Parkerï¿½s platform, apologized for the soaring flight to his accomplices, explained it with lavish logic to bigot priests; and the undertone of his whole apology is as if he had condescended to the foremost scholar of New England, to the purest and almost the only church that Boston boasts, to one whose place is in the vanguard of thought and life, to the Jove of the New England pulpit, whose brain forges thunderbolts before which every thing base, cruel and unchristian trembles on the shores of either ocean, wherever our English tongue is used. (Enthusiastic and prolonged applause.)
I was about to quote Mr. Parkerï¿½s favorite old maximï¿½ï¿½Let dog eat dogï¿½ï¿½which he has told us so often. It may not be our part to take special action in politics; but we stand here Massachusetts men. I said the other day, that Gov. Banks represented one class of the Republican party, who seemed to me to look upon Massachusetts only as a-convenient horseblock, by which to vault into the saddle of national office. They use the State simply as a means for something else. It is large enough for a pedestal. We do not lock upon it so. Little Greece, hardly larger, has kept the world talking about her achievements, has been the source of thought and liberty to every country since. Massachusetts is large enough to block the wheels of the Union; Massachusetts is large enough, if redeemed, to give the key-note to the free States of the North. What I want is to use this convenient width and breadth of State to inaugurate an absolutely faultless politics; to make our Constitution clean, so that other States can imitate it; so at to send out our politicians with no fetter of apology. Give us a Massachusetts with no stain of blood on her statute book, and no compromises in her Constitution. Give us a Massachusetts that does not send her legal sons down to Faneuil Hall with an argument in support of the Fugitive Slave Bill on their lips, and a railroad ticket to smuggle a domestic out of their own house in their pockets. Give us a Massachusetts that writes out on her statute-book the benevolent wishes of her citizens. Why should she not? Do you say there is any thing in the Constitution to the contrary? The Republicans say there is not. ï¿½Physician, heal thyself!ï¿½ I measure you by your yardstick. You tell me there is no clause in the Constitution which orders the return of fugitive slaves. If so, put it on the statute-book, that the dreams of Joseph Story and Roger B. Taney shall not be considered the constitutional law of the United States. (Loud cheers.) If, on the other side, you turn round and say, ï¿½We cannot pass that statute, because there is a clause in the Constitution that binds us to return the fugitive,ï¿½ then I ask, how do you settle it with your conscience when you swear to support such a Constitution? By what jugglery did you get inside of that State House, and obtain this power to act? Was it by swearing to return fugitive slaves? Own up, then; you are a slavehunter! In the language of Dr. Channing. you are ï¿½a legalized robber.ï¿½ In the language of Dr. Channing, you are ï¿½the watch-dog of the plantation.ï¿½ Do you accept the titles? Then own up. that yon have no right to laugh at the Marshal of Worcester, even if he were as bad as his words, or at Hallett, or George T. Curtis, or any other of the standing butts of merriment, when humor runs low, and the clouds hang heavy above us. Why did you swear to obey a Constitution that bids you not enact justice and make humanity law? If you cannot do it, then you have no right to be in that State House. I cannot render you justice,ï¿½ said Philip of Macedon to a woman who asked for it. ï¿½Then,ï¿½ said she, ï¿½you have no right to be king.ï¿½(Applause.)
I think, Mr. President, our argument is perfect to the Republican; and if Massachusetts enrolls ninety-nine patents to one from any other State, I do not see why she should not have a patent for the invention of a humane law. I am sure that nobody can say that it was ever invented before. (Applause.) Why should we not, under the great American principle laid down by Bancroft, that American law is not made
<c06>
by compacts and parchments, by enactments of the Legislature and the consent of the governed, but by acquiescence of the people-why should we not enact the present wish of the people? What did John Quincy Adams say. when, during the Missouri Compromise, they threatened to pot upon the statute book what he deemed an unconstitutional act: Why, he said, Gentlemen, if you foist that unconstitutional legislation into the Constitution, the Constitution no longer exists, and Massachusetts not only has a right, but the is bound to declare the Union dissolved-ï¿½ That was the principle of John Quicy Adams in 1819. Men shrink now from making a little law, as if our fathers never made any. They made the Constitution of 1780 and ï¿½87; and to-day, when the South wants a law made for her, she makes it to suit the times. How came Louisiana into this Union? Jefferson, who signed the bill, acknowledged it unconstitutional; Adams, in the Senate of the United States, pronounced the argument of Tracy of Connecticut, by which its constitutionality was denied, unanswerable.ï¿½ It was the We take the responsibilityï¿½ of the Democratic party which enacted the bill; ï¿½and now,ï¿½ said they, ï¿½let us see whether the people acquiesce.ï¿½ They did acquiesce. Then Florida was carried; afterward Mexico; and when the argument was brought up in the Senate that it was unconstitutional, even Webster allowed that the constitutional argument came too late; that the acquiescence of the people had settled that it was a law of the United States, though nobody could find it in the parchment. Now. I say, let the North act on this principle. Let Massachusetts begin by declaring on her statute-book, that there shall be no slave-hunting in her territory; that if slavery is the creature of municipal law, it may rest there, but the moment a man touches Massachusetts soil, all he shall have to prove is that he has touched it. (Loud applause.) If a million of men acquiesce in it; if, off the pavement, the people decree it, State street will cry ï¿½Amen,ï¿½ and the Supreme Court ï¿½cuckoo.ï¿½ (Laughter and cheers.) For you know as well as I do, that in the shifting quicksands of constitutional law, it is the opinion of the conservative intellect of Massachusetts that really guides the decisions of that Court. You know that if we can only bring up the public opinion of the State, by such an agitation as we are carrying on, to demand of the Legislature the enactment of a law to prohibit slave hunting on our soil, there will he no need of getting rid of the Supreme Court, or of getting rid of anybody. I complained to-night of being called to this platform; but the moment anti-slavery gets to be in the state in which Free Stateism is in Kansas, as described by Governor Robinson, there will be Doctors of Divinity on this platform, crowding for an on opportunity to say they always thought just so; the Supreme Court will hasten to make up a cast to undo the decision in the Sims case, and announce to the nation that Massachusetts holds herself to be a free State. What do you suppose makes the law for Taney and his associates? Is it the words the law for written in the law books or the decisions of the English Kingï¿½s Bench or our own No; it is the interests of the Democratic party at Washington, Buchanan or Douglasï¿½the rival interests of the chiefs of departments. Nobody deems it any libel on the Supreme Court at Washington to say so. Of course, our Supreme Court is a great deal better, and purer, and more learned,ï¿½because it is a great deal nearer home. I do not know but Lemuel Shaw is a more honest man than Roger B. Taney,ï¿½I am inclined to think he is. He once put on his brow that bright clear laurel, the decision in the Med case, when he said, the slave that is brought here, we will clutch her, and save her as a trophy of Massachusetts institutions! (Loud cheers.) It is not in Anti-slavery to be ungrateful. No; and it is not in Anti-slavery either to expect that the pulse of seventy or eighty shall beat with all the enthusiasm and fluid possibility of change that men of middle age possess, and ought to use. We pardon something to the necessarily faltering, and somewhat timid, and perhaps chilled pulses of age, It is only once in a while, just to prove the rule, that we see an exception, like your father, sir, [Edmund Quincy in the chair,] who outdoes, at eighty, even his mature age. (Loud cheers.)
But I have spoken as long as I ought. (ï¿½Go on, go on.ï¿½) All I can say is, I do hope that the Legislature will listen to this petition, and that we shall not close this Convention without the earnest hope planted in us, that from that Capitol will come down the ï¿½Amenï¿½ of the humanity of the State, and that we shall have it to say of Massachusetts, that she does order her judges to decree justice. (Loud applause.)
The Liberator. NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS. BOSTON, FEBRUARY 11, 1859.
Hearing on the Petition. We learn that the Legislative Committee on Federal Relations will give a hearing at the State House, on some day next week, yet to be determined, to the petition for a law prohibiting the rendition of any person in Massachusetts under the pretence, or on the claim, that said person is or has been a slave. Due notice of the hearing may be expected in the daily papers.

SLAVE ARIVAL IS ENGLAND.
Warrington, Eng., Jan. 11, 1859.
My Dear Sir,ï¿½You and all our friends will be glad to hear of the safe arrival of the Rev. S. J. May, of Syracuse, and Miss Sarah P. Remond, at Liverpool, on Sunday last. Miss Remond had a very severe time of it. Sickness continued her constant attendant the whole voyage. But she is now at my house, recruiting, I hope, her strength for labor in the good cause which has brought her here. She has not come before she was wanted. It is a very difficult thing to get Englishmen to believe the facts of the awful prostration of all moral and religious feeling on the subjects of slavery in America. Several of my own friends would not believe the case of Rev. Samuel Green, who was sentenced to ten yearsï¿½ imprisonment in Maryland, for having a copy of ï¿½Uncle Tomï¿½s Cabinï¿½ in his possession. No European despot durst have done such a monstrously tyrannical act.
I merely give you this as a specimen of the state of feeling here, and how much we want enlightening us to the facts of the present condition of the slavery question on this side the Atlantic. I hope by and by to have a little more time or strength, which with me is pretty nearly the same thing, to do something of the work I determined on before I left Boston, and which, though deferred, is I left Boston, and mind. With kind regards to you. H. c. Wright, and all my anti-slavery friends, believe me.
Yours very truly, W. ROBSON.

RESOLUTIONS EJECTING THE WANDERER FROM THE YACHT CLUB.

The American Almanac and Repository of Useful Knowledge, for the year 1759. 12 mo., pp. 384. crosby, Nichols & Co., 117 Washington Street, Boston.
The present issue forms volume X. of the third series of this valuable publication, which is justly called a Repository of Useful Knowledge. It contains the Calendar and Celestial Phenomena for the year 1859, with various tables of Meteorological information, in the first part; and in the second part, an immense amount and variety of information; first, respecting the government and institutions of the United States, and next, those of the individual States, comprising the most important facts, in regard to the Executive functionaries of the Federal and State governments, with the officers of their several; departments, the Post Office, its regulations and its officers, the Collectors of Customs, the Army, Navy, and Marine lists, the judiciary, the functionaries by whom our intercourse with foreign nations is maintained, our revenue and expenditure, commerce and navigation, institutions for education, elections and legislatures, banks, railroads, and telegraph lines, and other particulars too numerous to mention.
With these are given to the public two interesting and valuable scientific paper, one by Prof. Lovering, of Harvard University, on the history, use, and mechanical theory of the very curious Australian weapon called the Boomerang; the other by O. P. Bond, Esq., on Photography.
The American Almanac is a treasury of statistical information, presenting, with great order and compactness, facts which every one needs for occasional reference, and which every one may read with interest and advantage.
A SKILFUL WHITEWASHER. Mr. Choate is well known for his success in rhetorical embellishment applied to difficult cases in law, and ‘hard cases’ in members and morals. No one, more skilfully than he, can make the worse appear the better reason, and those malefactors who have long purses are always eager to secure his aid in their defence. We learn from the following, which is going the rounds of the newspapers, that he has now been engaged to plead a cause which eminently needs, and will severely test his peculiar talent.
ESSEX STREET CHURCH, BOSTON. The past and present members of the ESSEX Street Church and congregation are preparing to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the settlement of the Rev. Dr. Adams over that Society. The Hon. Rufus Choate, one of the parishioners, has accepted an invitation to deliver and address on the occasion. Dr. Adams, was installed on the 26th of March, 1834.
The very difficulties of this case may give it a professional attractiveness in the eyes of Mr. Choate, but it must be no easy task to defend the eulogist of slavery in this world, and of hill in the next.—C. K. W.

MISS HOLLEY IN WORCESTER.
MISS SALLIE HOLLEY, of Rochester, N. Y., daughter of the late Hon. Myron Holley, celebrated as a pioneer in the anti-slavery cause in this country, thirty years ago, delivered a very earnest, eloquent and feeling address on the Wrongs of American Slavery, last evening, at the Universalist Church.
The sympathetic, forcible, and logical manner in which she presented her views, and advocated the claims of the anti-slavery cause for support, evidently made great impression upon the large audience present. It was one of the best and most effective addresses which have been made, on the subject.
The speaker closed, thanking the proprietors of the house of the privilege of speaking in it. We trust that her statement, that that was the only church in the city which could be obtained for her to speak in, was made under misapprehension of the facts, as her address was of such a nature as should entitle its author to a cordial welcome in any Northern pulpit.—Worcester Daily Spy.
We doubt not that the Spy, on inquiry, will be satisfied that there was no misapprehension of the facts. But that Miss Holley’s statement is the literal truth, discreditable as it may be to the churches and leading religious influences of Worcester. We know that the two religious societies in Worcester, (one Trinitarian, the other Unitarian,) which stand the most favorably affected of all to the anti-slavery cause, refused to allow Miss Holley the use of their respective houses in which to rebuke the national sin of slavery, and plead the cause of the man fallen among thieves. It was understood that, in both cases, the minister of the church favored the request of Miss Holley, but the church authorities refused consent, to their shame be it spoken. What concord or affinity have such churches with the mind of Christ, or what claim to be regarded as churches of Christ?
This is the third time, within a few weeks, that a Universalist church has opened its doors to Miss Holley, as an advocate of the enslaved millions in this land of liberty! Let due honor be awarded for these instances of manliness and Christian fidelity, so rare even in Massachusetts.—M.

LECTURE OF C. C. BURLEIGH.
FALL RIVER, Feb. 6, 1859.
MR. GARRISON,—C. C. Burleigh, delivered an able and eloquent address in this city, last Tuesday evening, to a large and attentive audience. It was mainly devoted to an exposition of the guilty position of the North, politically, with regard to slavery, and an appeal to the people of the old Commonwealth no longer to bear the tread of a kidnapper upon her soil. He spoke of the changes which, it was claimed, had, virtually, been made in the U. S. Constitution, by the acquiescence of the people in unconstitutional acts; and hoped that Massachusetts would enact a law, for bidding the return of a fugitive slave from her soil, and demand that the South shall acquiesce in the enactment. The folly and inefficiency of attempting to prevent the extension of slavery, while sustaining and protecting it where it now exists, were referred to, and the guilt and immorality of aiding the slaveholder in perpetuating his outrages were plainly and forcibly pointed out. He closed by referring to the law-abiding character of the Saxon race, remarking that, when conscience and humanity were violated in obeying human enactments, the greatest proof of our law-abiding character was manifested by obedience to conscience and a diviner law. J. M. ALDRICH.
GREAT FIRE. At about three o’clock on Sunday morning, a fire broke out in the upper portion of Russell’s mechanical bakery, corner of Battery and Commercial streets, which was totally destroyed. The building was of brick, with a granite front, extending 64 feet on Commercial and 132 feet on Battery and Salutation streets, and contained two of Berdan’s automatic ovens, kneading machines, &c., and 23,000 barrels of flour on storage. The bakery had gone into operation on Thursday, when over 15,000 loaves of b read were baked delivered. The falling walls partially destroyed two or three adjoining wooden tenements. Daniel Henderson, fireman, was killed by the falling of one the side walls, Capt. Wilson of the steam fire engine Eclipse was seriously injured internally, and several others were more or less injured. One man is missing, and supposed to be under the ruins. The total loss of property is estimated at $300,000, on which there is a partial insurance. Mr. Russell will immediately construct a fire-proof building, and carry out his intention of establishing a mechanical steam-bakery in Boston. The fire was undoubtedly the work of an incendiary.
The speech of Mr. C. C. BURLEIGH, which occupies our first page, is marked by that force of logic and power of reasoning which characterize all the efforts of that eloquent and long-tried advocate of the enslaved in our land. We commend it to the special attention of every member of: the Legislature, as we deem it unanswerable.
Miss Sarah P. Remond, of Salem, Mass., has delivered a strong anti-slavery lecture in Liverpool, before a crowded audience. Rev. W. H. Channing resided. Miss R. was enthusiastically received.

DEBATE UPON AN ANTI-SLAVERY PETITION.
REMARKS OF MR. CUSHING.
In the Massachusetts House of Representatives, on Friday last—
The petition of Samuel Smith and 89 others of Middlefield, for an act to prevent the rendition of fugitive slaves, was presented; and pending a motion for its reference to the Committee on Federal Relations, Mr. Cushing rose and remarked that he had received new light, with reference to these petitions, since he made the speech charging the petitioners with disingenuousness or foolishness. The proceedings of these evil-disposed persons, included in the Anti-Slavery Society, showed this movement to be theirs. In a statement of their purposes, they had openly avowed a conspiracy against the peace and welfare of our common country. They had ostentatiously professed their unappeasable hatred of the Constitution and the Union of the United States, and evinced all that was treasonable in spirit. But, beyond this, they had professed the purpose to kindle a servile war, and convert one-half of our States into another St. Domingo—expelling the Americans, and leaving the territory to Africans. The speaker also complained that there were English accomplices in this matter. The consummation was, that this association, while declaring their hatred and contempt of the Legislature and the General Government, had boasted of forcing their purposes through previous Legislatures, and expect to do the same with the present one. These avowals constituted the expression of these petitions, and might suggest to the House the degree of consideration and respect to which they were entitled.
REMARKS OF MR. WELLS, OF GREENFIELD.
Mr. Wells, of Greenfield, said the simple question before the House was the reference of the petition. He could not see what the House had to do with what passed outside. He cared nothing for the remarks of Englishmen, or of Jefferson Davis when he advised the taking up of arms against the North. If gentlemen chose to air their rhetoric outside, he did not think the Legislature would, in consequence thereof, turn a single hair’s breadth from its course, but take the usual course in this instance.
REMARKS OF MR. GOODWIN, OF LOWELL.
Mr. GOODWIN, of Lowell, said he was not surprised that the gentleman from Newburyport had scented out an African in this woodpile, but was surprised to hear that he had discovered a band of conspirators. In this connection, allusion was made to those Southern democrats who once consulted together as to what they should do in the event of the election of a Republican President, and also to the fact that certain Southerners strenuously advocated a southern line of railroad to the Pacific, so that it might be within their portion of the Republic which they proposed to dissever. He was glad the gentleman from Newburyport was inclined to look after conspirators, the most dangerous of whom might be found in the South. He hoped the petition would go to the Committee.
REMARKS OF MR. JOHNSON, OF ABINGTON.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Abington, alluded to another dangerous society. He said it was formed at the National Capitol in 1835, and from that time down to last fall, when it held its Convention at Montgomery, it had been avowedly committed to the dissolution of the Union.
FURTHER REMARKS BY MR. CUSHING.
Mr. CUSHING, of Newburyport—
Mr. Speaker: I have accomplished more than I expected. My original purpose was to call the attention of the House to the fact—and again reiterated—of the declaration of certain persons, out of this House, that they control the Legislature of this Commonwealth; that they have heretofore compelled them to do what they desired; and that they expect to compel it now
Now, sir, if these persons have unwise, criminal—not benevolent, but malevolent and treasonable—purposes, then it is my duty, in my judgment, as a member of this House, to notice the character and object of these petitions at the very start. I am not bound to wait longer; and I have a right to characterize it as it deserves, from the start; and in my judgment it is important so to do.
That, sir, is one, and the other is this: Gentleman who have so promptly arisen upon this floor to respond to the views which I presented, and to maintain the wisdom and propriety of these petitions, have not denied that its signers and other man of kindred principles have made the declaration that their purpose was to exercise an unjust and improper influence in this Legislature. Not at all; far from it; on the contrary there is a complaint that some friend of mine, in past times, may have voted with such a purpose, or that there may have exists some embryo society elsewhere that has entertained some such purpose—not in this Commonwealth, not before this Legislature. In what respect, Mr. Speaker, is it pertinent to say that purposes, wise or unwise, have been held by persons in other States? It is our duty to justify our own Legislature; and when that Legislature is in danger of being so swerved as to run counter to the dictates of the Constitution, it does not answer the suggestion to say that other persons have done wrong in other parts of the Union. Let us, at any rate, do right ourselves. So the remarks from my friend from Greenfield, [Mr. Wells,] were hardly applicable to the case. What Mr. Davis said upon the subject referred to, when connected with the context, would be just what that gentleman would himself say, here in this place,—that is, that if the other States in the Union should undertake, by unconstitutional violence, to destroy the rights of his State, he, as a citizen of that State, was prepared to resist that violence. Would not that gentleman say here, in his place, that if the other thirty States in the government were to combine by unconstitutional violence to oppress and tyrannize over the State of Massachusetts,—would he not say that he would be prepared to take arms? I know he would; I know his patriotism and devoted attachment to his native State. I am here ready to repeat, in my own place, in behalf of Massachusetts, the declaration which Jefferson Davis made in Mississippi in behalf of Mississippi, that in the supposed case of unconstitutional, violent oppression upon his own Slate, by other States of the Union, he would be prepared to resist it. That is supposing a contingency which has not arisen, but I trust that if it ever should arise, there does not exist a single State in the Union which would not be prepared to assert its constitutional rights, by lawful means if it might be but if not, then by appeal to the revolutionary forces to which our fathers appealed.
Now, then, Mr. Speaker, I have only this further to say, drawn from me by the comments made upon my remark that those purposes of carnage avowed by that society, on the occasion of the discussion of these memorials; that is to say, the sum of the action at that time was to invite and arrange to receive English aid for the purpose of producing civil war in these United States. Aye, that society which backs these petitions declares, proposes—as it is the settled arrangement—that it shall be the subsidized agent and tool of Englishmen, for the purpose of overthrowing the constitution of this Union, and of inducing servile war in this country. I do not believe, sir, that we are to plunge into that vortex of madness and treason. No, Mr. Speaker, I trust we shall not; and I take courage to think that no such madness is by others contemplated, when I find his Excellency the Governor reproached that he, from that chair, played the Prince of Denmark, leaving out the part of Hamlet. And I take more courage when I see how desirous gentlemen are that these petitions should go sub silentio to this committee. And when I find that when I mention these facts, by way of opening the minds of gentlemen, I am denounced as an agitator of the slavery question. I desire to be so considered, if by so doing I may in any degree contribute to arrest what I regard as a mischievous under-cover either of revolution or of the subversion of the constitution, prejudicial to the harmony of the Union, and adverse to the common interests of our common country.
REMARKS OF MR. ELBR1DGE OF CANTON.
Mr. Speaker: I do not propose to be a sectional agitator of slavery in this House. I have, at different times, spoken upon the subject, and I may be allowed here to say that I have some strong views and strong feelings upon the subject of slavery. Perhaps at this time it is not pertinent that we should enter into a discussion of that subject. It seems to me, however, that the petition now before the House is proper, and that it should be presented to the Committee on Federal Relations. I believe that committee quite competent to perform any duties in regard to the matter which may be necessary, and that they will recommend to this House such measures in regard to our federal relations as will be, in the judgment of this House, expedient for this Legislature to pass.
But there is one thing which quite amuses me,
<c03>
Mr. Speaker; and that is the extreme sensitiveness of the gentleman from Newburyport, whenever the question of slavery is brought forward in this House, by petition or otherwise. He stands up on all occasions as its chief and foremost defender. For what reason? Because be believes that the system is right, or for other purposes which might be very fairly and reasonably imputed to the gentleman from Newburyport? I believe the gentleman is yet young enough to repent of the accusation which he makes, when he stands up in his place in this House. and says that the persons composing the anti-slavery society of Massachusetts are a kind of desperadoes. Why, sir, if they are the revolutionists, if they are the secessionists, there are two classes of such men in this country, one headed by the gentleman from Newburyport, and the other by the anti-slavery people of Massachusetts; and the question is, how can we best preserve the Union, and keep them both loyal to it.
Sir, I heard the gentleman say that if thirty States should make an aggression upon a single State, then the Revolutionary blood would flow in his veins, and that he would stand up as the defender of those first principles of the Revolution, foremost among the men of this country. Why, sir, when I beard the sentiment go forth throughout the country that a slaveholder—an infamous slaveholder —does the gentleman from Newburyport understand it? an infamous slaveholder rose to say that he would call his slave-roll on Bunker Hill—then, Mr. Speaker, my blood boiled, and you might have taken the last drop of it in defence of Massachusetts. (Applause.)
Sir, there has been constant reference—and it has been offensive to my ears, and to the ears of the people of Massachusetts—to the congratulation, by the gentleman from Newburyport, of his Excellency, upon leaving out of his message to the Houses of the Legislature the subject of slavery. Let me tell the gentleman from Newburyport, that even his Excellency the Governor of Massachusetts cannot afford to ignore the subject of anti-slavery. No public man in Massachusetts can afford to overlook the subject of slavery and our federal relations. And I trust that when the matter is presented by the Committee on Federal Relations, there will be a fair-opportunity to discuss this whole matter, from beginning to end; and the gentleman from Newburyport will remember that there are blows to give as well as blows to take.
SPEECH OF MR. KIMBALL.
MR. KIMBALL of Boston.
Mr. Speaker: I was really rejoiced when the gentleman from Newburyport rose the second time, and made the statement that he opposed this matter from his sense of duty, and not from any feeling on the subject; that he let the members of the House down a little from the fever pitch of excitement into which they must have been drawn, in regard to the ingenious arrangement of words, stating that there was danger to the country from a gang of desperadoes who intend to destroy the peace and union of the country. I know there must have been gentlemen here, who, after listening to that eloquent advocate of a principle which some of us do not admire, must have begun to shake a little in their boots, and to doubt whether the government would hold together long enough to finish this session, and get the Revised Statutes adopted. (Laughter.) You know, sir, there were raw heads and bloody bones pictured out here, and I have no doubt blood swam before the eyes of many members of this House, the gentleman called so vividly to our minds the horrid transactions of St. Domingo, where the earth was deluged and saturated with blood. The gentleman gave us the blood three or four times over, for fear we might not know what an unpleasant looking thing it is, and what a calamity it would be to this country if a few colored people should have their wishes carried out. But, not satisfied with directing us to the immediate dangers besetting us, and his entire disinterestedness, willing to throw himself forward, in the front of the battle, he calls our attention to the fact, o’er and o’er, that there is an Englishman in this matter; that there is an Englishman coming to take this country; that we are in danger because there is an Englishman after us. (Great laughter.) I was astonished when I heard that from that gentleman, because we remembered when he commanded in the army in this country, in a foreign state; and I considered there must be good cause for fear, if the late Brigadier thinks there is danger to this country because one Englishman is coining to take us! Why, sir, if it were possible for me to be afraid of anything, I should have got down under the seats, and hid, for fear the Englishman was here in disguise. (Renewed merriment.)
I thank the gentleman that he spoke too quick for me, for it gave me time to cool my blood; and then I called to my mind the history of the Indian wars that I had read, and the history of the Revolutionary War, and the Life of Washington, where it relates what he encountered, and, some how or other, I came to the conclusion that when this country was a great deal smaller than it is now, we were not afraid of as much as half a dozen Englishmen, who tried to whip us, and that we beat them, and settled the thing entirely satisfactory to ourselves. And I think if this one Englishman, or the entire nation, should come here and attempt to split up the Union, I think we can flax them out, and send them home to their business more effectually than in the war of the Revolution.
The gentleman tells us St. Domingo may be reenacted here; our fair country may be deluged with blood, and a hundred other evils may come upon us; but the greater, the mightier evil than all is, that a little party of fanatics, disturbers of the peace, who want to destroy our common country, are going to get, or have got, possession of the Legislature, upon this great principle. Well, we are all under obligation to act according to our best understanding; and if we have allowed a little society to take possession of us, and brow beat us, and compel us to take their position, the more it is to be pitied! It is melancholy in the extreme. (Much laughter.) Bat when I reflected upon that portion of the gentleman’s speech, I somehow or other came to the conclusion that there are a large number here who sympathize too strongly with the outsiders, in the principle that sent their petition here, and that consequently we make ourselves willing servants to the advocates of this principle, who have been so unfortunate or fortunate as not to be returned to this House.
But there comes up another phase of tins matter, gratifying to my friend from Newburyport. And you may remember that when the Governor ‘enacted the play of Hamlet, with the part of Hamlet left out,’ the gentleman was so overjoyed that he couldn’t sit still, as the rest of us did, but got up and told the House how much he was delighted with Governor Banks’s address. Well, now, it was kind in him; because, he not sympathizing with the Governor, it must have been gratifying to the Governor. I have no doubt Governor Banks slept much easier and happier that night, and ate a better and heartier breakfast than usual the next morning. (Great merriment.) But if the Governor left out the part of Hamlet, I am rather inclined to think His Excellency has a little more good common sense than some gentlemen give him credit for—that he has taken hold to administer the affairs of the State in a manner satisfactory to the people of the State; and I have no doubt he intends to devote his time and his message to subjects that require the attention of the Legislature; and that he will not do as some gentlemen do who occupy their time in the mere utterance of words, on paper or orally, for the purpose of making a display, but will occupy himself in putting on paper such things as it is necessary to call the attention of the Legislature to, and leave things upon which they are as much interested and as desirous as he to take care of, without any reminder on his part. He believes that the gentlemen of the Legislature have some ideas of their own, that they are honest and independent and fearless, whatever; may be said, and that they will grapple with any subject that they understand, without any prompting of his. And I trust that gentlemen will petition upon all these matters, of interest to them and the country. And as my friend from Abington and others have traveled down a thousand and two thousand miles, in relation to what has been said—the gentleman from Newburyport does not prefer to go as far as that—he prefers to stick to that dreadful Englishman, and his one Englishman in Massachusetts is a thousand times bigger bugbear to him than all that the disunionists of the Jefferson Davis kind can do or say.
In regard to the subject of this debate, I trust gentlemen having grievances to redress will always bear in their petitions to the Legislature of Massachusetts.
Mr. WELLS of Greenfield wished to add a word on the position which he had taken in his previous remarks. He knew nothing of Mr. Cushing’s desperadoes, his Englishmen, or the treasonable plots
<c04>
which had been charged, or the boasts of overawing the Legislature, except from Mr. C. ’s statement, and so had no concern with them. Such statements were not unfamiliar to him. He remembered that at the last session, similar considerations had been held out to frighten the Legislature from the enactment of a measure of general importance to the Commonwealth. What boasts were made by persons outside the Legislature, or what imputations of improper influence might be thrown out, were not, in his judgment, considerations properly to influence the action of the House.
He had not misstated the remark of Jefferson Davis. It was under the circumstances stated by the gentleman from Newburyport, that Mr. Davis proposed to dissolve the Union, that is, when a Republican President should be elected, a contingency which Mr. Wells trusted would before long occur, when our present Governor, whose silence Mr. Cushing so much admired, might have occasion to repress the threatened insurrection.
For the report of this debate in the House, we are indebted to the Boston Journal of Saturday. How industriously bent on making himself alike the laughing-stock of the people of Massachusetts, and the supple tool of the Southern slave oligarchy, is Mr. Caleb Cushing of Newburyport!
DEPARTURE OF THEODORE PARKER. Mr. Parker left this city on Friday last for New York, whence he has doubtless embarked, ere this, on his West India voyage for the benefit of his health. The following farewell letter was read at Music Hall, by Mr. J. R. Manley, on Sunday, 30th ult., and was listened to with deep emotion by an immense audience. It was crowded out from our last paper by a pressure of other matter:—
MUCH VALUED FRIENDS: When I first found myself unable to speak to you again, and medical men bade me be silent, and flee off for my life to a more genial clime, I determined, before I went, to make ready and publish my New Year’s sermon, the last I ever preached; and the one which was to follow it, the last I ever wrote, lying there yet unspoken; and, also, to prepare a letter to you, reviewing our past intercourse of now nearly fifteen years.
The phonographer’s swift pen made the first work easy, and the last sermon lies printed before you: the next I soon laid aside, reserving my forces for the last. But, alas! the Thought, and still more the Emotion, requisite for such a Letter, under such circumstances, are quite too much for me now. So, with much regret, I find myself compelled to forego the attempt—nay, rather, I trust, only to postpone it for a few weeks.
Now I can but write this note in parting, to thank you for the patience with which you have heard me so long; for the open-handed generosity which has provided for my unexpected needs; for the continued affection which so many of you have always shown me, and now more tenderly than ever; and yet above all, for the joy it has given me to see the great ideas and emotions of true religion spring up in your fields with such signs of promise. If my labors were to end to-day, I should still say, ‘Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,’ for I think few men have seen larger results follow such labors, and so brief. But I shall not think our connection is ended, or likely soon to be; I hope yet to look in your eyes again, and speak to your hearts. So far as my recovery depends on me, be assured, dear friends, I shall leave nothing undone to effect it; and so far as it is beyond human control, certainly you and I can trust the Infinite Parent of us all, without whose beneficent Providence not even a sparrow falls to the ground; living here or in heaven, we are all equally the children of that unbounded Love. It has given me great pain that I could not be with such of you as have lately suffered bereavements and other affliction, and at least speak words of endearment and sympathy, when words of consolation would not suffice.
I know not how long we shall be separated, but, while thankful for our past relations, I shall stilt fervently pray for your Welfare and Progress in True Religion, both as a Society and as individual men and women. I know you will still think only too kindly of Your minister and friend,
THEODORE PARKER.
Exeter place, Jan. 27, 1859.

COMPENSATION CONVENTION.
ALBANY, Jan. 26.
The Compensated Emancipation Society held its session in this city this evening, Dr. Nott, of Union College, presiding.
The Convention was addressed by Dr. Nott, Elihu Burritt, the Rev. Dr. Welch, and Bradford R. Wood.
Resolutions were introduced, embodying Elihu Burritt’s principle of compensated emancipation, and determining to raise funds to carry out the plan.
A. M. Powell offered objections to the plan, on account of its immorality in principle, its injustice to the poor whites, and its impracticability.
Mr. Hutchinson, of Orleans, inquired if the plan contemplated forcible interference with slavery?
Mr. Burritt replied that it did not; he defended the morality and practicability of the plan, and denounced the Abolitionists as attacking constantly the sinners of the South, and neglecting to urge repentance.
Mr. Powell replied, defending the Abolitionists; they asked the repentance of the North. He attacked the colonization scheme, because it refused to recognize the humanity of slaves.
Dr. Nott indorsed Mr. Powell’s views as to human rights pertaining to all classes. At the North, all men are more or less restricted in their rights. Women and colored people were instanced in support of the Doctor’s views. He had come to the Convention, hoping to receive some new light on these questions, and was gratified at the debate which had taken place.
Mr. John C. Underwood, of Virginia, was called on, and addressed the meeting at length. He declared himself an out-and-out Abolitionist, and in favor of immediate emancipation. He honored the benevolence of this movement, but objected to the purchase of the slaves as immoral. He gave his experience among the slaveholders of Virginia, where, he said, the present movement excited the utmost displeasure. He had never heard one of them speak favorably of the plan. He would rather claim on his part that compensation was due to the slaves and poor whites. He designated the scheme as impracticable, because slaveholders would not meet them half way. The proposition was to pay $250 each for the slaves in forty years, while the masters could put their slaves in the market now, and get from $800 to $1,500 each for them. He would rather raise the proposed one thousand millions to be devoted to the education of the poor whites. He gave encouraging accounts of the progress of emancipation, and believed it would soon be accomplished in Virginia through the organization for settling the lands there by Northern emigration. Mr. Underwood’s speech was received very favorably.
At an adjourned meeting only a dozen or so persons were present, the resolutions reported at the prior meeting were adopted, and an adjournment, sine die, took place.
The meeting is regarded as unfavorable to the plan of compensated emancipation.
E. H. HETWOOD acknowledges the receipt of the following sums for the cause:

TO DYSPEPTICS,
And all who suffer the tortures which the disease inflicts, in one form or another of its many phases: Cure yourselves permanently and speedily by using
The Oxygenated Bitters.
The ’Weekly Novelette,’ of Sept. 18, says: 
Dyspepsia is one of the prevailing diseases of our country. This is owing both to climate and the almost universal habit of eating our meals too rapidly to admit of proper digestion. But, in spite of these adverse circumstances, this disease, even when it becomes chronic, disappears rapidly by the use of the Oxygenated Bitters, which have been found to prove an infallible remedy.
From the Publisher of a weekly circulated Magazine.
MESSRS. S. W. FOWLE & Co: I have taken three bottles of the Oxygenated Bitters, and have derived great benefit from their use. I have been much troubled with Dyspepsia for several yean, and found nothing that afforded me any relief until I used the Bitters. I most cheerfully recommend them to all who are afflicted with this troublesome and stubborn complaint.
JAMES ROBINSON,
of the ’Student and Schoolmaster.’ 
From Gen. A. C. DODGE, our Minister to Spain.
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 18. 
DR. GEO. B. GREEN: DEAR SIR—The Oxygenated Bitters with which you were so kind as to furnish me, have had a most salutary effect in my case. I was troubled with Dyspepsia for four years, during which time I tried many remedies, but never met with any so good as your Bitters. I am now in the enjoyment of good health, and I hope and believe that all who use the Oxygenated Bitters will find them as serviceable as I have found them.
With high respect, your ob’t servant, 
A. C. DODGE.

POETRY.
CENTENNIAL BIRTHDAY OF BURNS
BY JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.
I.
A hundred years! they're quickly fied,
With all their joy and sorrow,
Their dead leaves shed upon the dead,
Their fresh ones sprung by morrow;
And still the patient seasons bring
Their change of sun and shadow,
New birds still sing with every spring,
New violets spot the meadow.
II.
A hundred years! and Nature's powers
No greater grown nor lessened!
They saw no flowers more sweet than ours,
No fairer new moon's crescent;
If she would treat us poets so,
Would so from winter free us,
And set our slow old sap allow,
To sprout in fresh ideas!
III.
Alas! I think, what worth of parts
Have brought me here competing
To speak what starts in myriad hearts
With Burn's memory beating;
A theme like this would Bryant choose,
Longfellow, Holmes or Whittier;
If my poor muse can't fill their shoes,
Pray pardon her and pity her.
IV.
As I sat musing what to say,
And bow my verse to number,
Some elf in play passed by that way,
And sank my lids in slumber;
And on my sleep a vision stole,
Which I will put in metre,
Of Burns's soul at the wicket hole
Where sits the good St. Peter.
V.
The saint, me thought, had left his post
That day to Holy Willie,
Who swore, ' Each ghost that comes shall toast
In brimstone, will he, nil he;
There's none need hope with phrases fine
Their score to wipe a sin free;—
I'll chalk a sign, to save their tryin'—
A hand Vide infra! '
VI.
Alas! no Boil's too cold or dry
For spiritual smoll potatoes,
Scrimped nature's spry the trade to ply
Of diaboli advocatus,
Who lay bent pins in the penance stool
Where Mercy spreads a cushion,
Who've just one rule for knave or fool,
It saves so much confusion.
VII.
So, when Burns knocked, Will knit his brows,
His window-gap made scanter,
And said, 'Go rouse the other house,
We lodge no Tam O'Shanter!'
'We lodge!' laughed Burns, 'now well I see
Death cannot kill our nature,
No human flea but thinks that he
May speak for his Creator.
VIII.
'But Willie, friend, don't turn me forth,
Auld Clootie needs no gauger,
And if on earth I had small worth,
You've let in worse, I'll wager!'
'Na, nane has knockit at the yett'
But found me hard as whunstane,
There's chances yet your bread to get,
Wi Auld Nick, gaugin' brimstone.'
IX.
Meanwhile, the uno' guid' had ta'en
Their place to watch the process,
Flattening in vain on many a pane
Their disembodied noses;
Remember, please, 'tis all a dream,
One can't control the fancies
Through sleep that stream with wayward gleam,
Like midnight's boreal dances.
X.
Old Willie's tone grew sharp's a knife;
'Imprimis, I indite ye
For makin' strife wi ' the water o' life,
And preferring aqua vita.'
Then roared a voice with lusty din,
Like a skipper's when 'tis blowy,
'If that's a sin, I'd ne'er ba' got in,
As sure as my name's Noah!'
XI.
Sly Willie turned another leaf—
'There's many here have heard ye,
To the pain and grief o' true belief,
Say hard things o' the clergy!'
Then rang a clear tone over all,—
'One plea for him allow me,
I once heard call from o'er me, " Saul,
Why persecutest thou me?"'
XII.
To the next charge vexed Willie turned,
And, sighing, wiped his glasses,—
'I'm much concerned to find ye yearned
O'er warmly tow'rd the lasses!'
But David cried, ' Your ledger shut,
E'en Adam fell by woman,
And hearts close shut with if and but,
If safe, are not so human!'
XIII.
When sudden glory round me broke,
And low melodious surges,
Of wings whose stroke to splendor woke
Creation's farthest verges;
A cross stretched, ladder-like, secure
From earth to heaven's own portal,
Whereby God's poor, with footing sure,
Climbed up to peace immortal.
XIV.
I heard a voice serene and low,
(With my heart I seemed to hear it,)
Fall soft and slow us snow on snow,
Like grace of the heavenly spirit;
As sweet as over new-born son
The croon of new-made mother,
The voice begun, Sore-tempted one!'
Then, pausing, sighed, 'Our brother!'
XV.
'If not a sparrow falls, unless
The Father sees and knows it,
Think, rocks he leas his form express?
The soul hit own deposit?
If only dear to him the strong
That never trip nor wander,
Where were the throng whose morning song
Thrills his blue arches yonder?
XVI.
'Do souls alone clear-eyed, strong-kneed,
To him true service render?
And they who need his hand to lead,
Find they his heart untended?
Through all your various ranks and fates,
He opens doors to duty,
And he that waits there at your gates
Was servant of His Beauty.
XVII.
‘The earth must richer sap secrete,
(In time, could ye but know it!)
Must juice concrete with fiercer heat
Ere she can make her poet;
These larger hearts must feel the rolls
Of stormier-waved temptation,
<c02>
These star-wide souls between their poles
Bear zones of tropic passion.
XVIII.
Her cheaper broods in palaces
She raises under glasses,
But souls like these, heaven's hostages,
Spring shelterless as grasses; 
He loved much! that is gospel good,
Howe'er the text you handle;
From common wood the cross was hewed,
By love turned priceless sandal
XIX.
If scant his service at the kirk,
He paters heard, and aves,
From choirs that lurk in hedge and birk,
From blackbird and from mavis;
The cowering mouse, poor unroofed thing,
In him found mercy's angel,
The daisy's ring brought every spring
To him Faith's fresh evangel!
XX.
Not he the threatening texts who deals,
Is highest 'mong the preachers,
But he who feels the woes and weals
Of all God's wandering creatures;
He doth good work whose heart can find
The spirit 'neath the letter;
Who makes his kind of happier mind,
Leaves wiser men and better.
XXI.
They make Religion be abhorred,
Who round with darkness gulf her,
And think no word can please the Lord
Unless it smell of sulphur;
Bear Poet-heart, that childlike guessed
The Father's loving-kindness,
Come now to rest! thou didst his hest,
If haply't was in blindness!'
XXII.
Then leapt Heaven's portals wide apart,
And, at their golden thunder,
With sudden start I woke, my heart
Still throbbing-full of wonder:
‘Father,’ I said, ‘'tis known to thee
How thou thy Saints preparest,
But this I see-Saint Charity
Is still the first and fairest!'
XXIII.
Dear Bard and Brother! let who may
Against thy faults be railing!
(Though far, I pray, from us be they
That never knew a failing!)
One toast I'll give, and that not long,
Which thou would 'st pledge, if present-
To him whose song, in nature strong,
Makes man of prince and peasant!

OUGHT WOMEN TO LEARN THE ALPHABET? NO. 1
PARIS Smiled, for an hour or two, in the year 1801, when, amidst Napoleon's mighty projects for re-modelling the religion and government of his empire,
the ironical satirist, Sylvain Marechal, thrust in his Plan for a Law prohibiting the Alphabet to Women.' Daring, keen, sarcastic, learned, the little 
tract retains to-day go much of its pungency, that we can hardly wonder at the honest simplicity of the author's friend and biographer, Madame Gacon Dufour, who declared that he must be partially in sane, and proceeded to prove herself so by replying to him. His proposed statute consists of eighty-two clauses, and is fortified by a 'whereas' of a hundred and thirteen weighty reasons. He exhausts the range of history to show the frightful results which have followed this taste of the fruit of the tree of knowledge; quotes the Encyclopedie, to prove that the woman who knows the alphabet has already lost a portion of her innocence; cites the opinion of Moliere, that any female who has unhappily learned anything in this line should affect ignorance, when possible; asserts that knowledge rarely makes men attractive, and females never; opines that women
have no occasion to peruse Ovid's 'Art of Love,' since they know it all in advance; remarks that three-quarters of female authors are no better than
they-should be; maintains that Madame Guion would have been far more useful, had she been metely pretty and an ignoramus, such as nature made
lier,-that Ruth and Naomi could not read, and Boaz probably would never have married into the family, had they possessed that accomplishment,-that the Spartan women did not know the alphabet, nor the Amazon, nor Penelope, nor Andromache, nor Lucretia, nor Joan of Arc, nor Petrarch's Laura,
nor the daughters of Charlemagne, nor the three hundred and sixty-five wives of Mohammed;-but that Sappho and Madame de Maintenon could read together too well, while the case of Saint Brigitta, who brought forth twelve children and twelve books, was clearly exceptional, and afforded no safe precedent.	
We take it, that the brilliant Frenchman has touched the root of the matter. Ought women to learn the alphabet? There the whole question lies. Concede this little fulcrum, and Arehimede will move the world before she is done with it; it becomes merely a question of time. Resistance must be made here or nowhere. Obsta principiis. Woman must be a subject or an equal; there is no middle ground. What if the Chinese proverb should turn out to be, after all, the summit of wisdom,-For men, to cultivate virtue is knowledge; for women, to renounce knowledge is virtue'?
No doubt, the progress of events is slow, like the working of the laws of gravitation generally. Certainly, there has been but little change in the legal position of woman since China was in its prime, until within the last dozen years. Lawyers admit that the fundamental theory of English and Oriental law is the same on this point: Man and wife are one, and that one is the husband. It is the oldest if legal traditions. When Blackstone declares that o the very being and existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage,' and American Kent echoes that' her legal existence and authority are in a manner lost,-when Petersdorff asserts that ' the husband has the right of imposing such corporeal restraints as he may deem necessary,' and Bacon that' the husband hath, by law, power and dominion over his wife, and may keep her by force within the bounds of duty, and may beat her, but not in a violent or cruel manner,'-when Mr. Justice Cole-
It may be well to fortify this point by a racy extract from that rare and amusing old book, the pioneer of its class, entitled 'The Lawes Resolutions of Women's Rights, or the Lawes Provision for Women. A Methodicall Collection of such Statutes and Customes, with the Cases, Opinions, Arguments, and Points of
Learning in the Law as doe properly concern Women.' London: A. D. 1632, pp. 404. 4to. The pithy sentences lose immeasurably, however, by being re
moved from their original black-letter setting.
Lib. III. Sect. VII. The Baron may beats his Wife.
The rest followeth, Justice Brooke 12. H. S. fo. 4. uffirmeth plainly, that if a roan beat an out-law, a traitor, a Pagan, his villein, or his wife, it is dispunishable, because by the Law Common these persons can haue no action: God send Gentle-women better sport, or better companie.
'But it seemeth to be very true, that there is some kind of castigation which Law permits a Husband to vse; for if a woman be threatened by her husband to
bee beaten, mischieued, or slaine, Fitzherbert sets done a Writ which she may sve out of Chancery to compell him to finde surety of honest behauior toward
her, and that he shall neither doe nor procure to be done to her (marke I pray you) any bodily damage, otherwise then appertaines to the office of a Husband
for lawfull and reasonable correction. See for this the new Nat bre. fo. 80 f. & fo. 238 f.
How farre that extendeth I cannot tell, but herein the sexe feminine is at no very great disaduantage: for first for the lawfulness; If it be in no other re
gard lawfull to beat a man's wife, then because the poore wench can sve no other action for it, I pray, why may not the Wife beat the Husband againe, what
action can he haue if she doe: where two tenants in Common be on a horse, and one them will trauell and vse this horse, hee may keepe it from his Companion
a yeare, two or three and so be euen with him; so the actionlesse woman beaten by her Husband, hath retaliation left to beate him againe, if she dare. If
he come to the chancery or Justices in the Country of the peace against her, because her recognizance alone will hardly bee taken, he were best be found for her, and then if he be beaten the second time, let him know the price of it on God's name.'
<c03>
ridge roles that the husband, in certain cases, ' has a right to confine his wife in his own dwelling-house and restrain her from liberty for an indefinite time,' and Baron Alderson sum6 it all up tersely, 'The wife is only the servant of her husband,'-these high authorities simply reaffirm the dogma of the Gentoo code, four thousand years old and more:-' A man, both day and night, must keep his wife so much in subjection that she by no means be mistress of her own actions. If the wife: have her own free will, notwithstanding she be of a superior caste, she will behave amiss.
Yet behind these unchanging institutions, a pressure has been for centuries becoming concentrated, which, now that it has begun to act, is threatening to overthrow them all. It has not yet operated very visibly in the Old World, where (even in England) the majority of women have not yet mastered the alphabet, and cannot sign their own names in the marriage-register. But in this country, the vast changes of the last twelve years are already a matter of history. No trumpet has been sounded, no earthquake felt, while State after State has ushered into legal existence one half of the population within its borders. Every Free State in the American Union, except perhaps Illinois and New Jersey, has conceded to married women, in some form, the separate control of property. Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania have gone farther, and given them them control of their own earnings,-given it wholly and directly, that is,-while New York and other States have given it partially or indirectly. Legislative committees in Ohio and Wisconsin have recommended, in printed reports, the extension of the right of suffrage to women; Kentucky (like Canada) has actually extended it, in certain educational matters, and a Massachusetts legislative committee has suggested the same thing; while the Kansas Constitutional Convention came within a dozen votes of extending it without reserve, and expunging the word male from the Constitution. Surely, here and now, might poor M. Marechal exclaim, The bitter fruits of the original seed appear, and the sad question recurs, whether women ought ever to have tasted of the alphabet.
Mr. Everett, perhaps without due caution, advocated, last summer, the affirmative of this question. With his accustomed eloquence, he urged on the attention of Suleiman Bey the fact of the equal participation of the sexes in the public-school system of Boston, while omitting to explain to him that the equality is of very recent standing. No doubt, the eminent Oriental would have been pleased to hear that this public administration of the alphabet to females, on any terms, is an institution but little more than a half century old in the city of Boston. It is well established by the early deeds and documents, that a large proportion of Puritan women could not write their own names; and in Boston especially, for a hundred and fifty years, the public schools included boys only. In the year 1789, however, the notable discovery was made, that the average attendance of pupils from April to October was only one half of that reported for the remainder of the year. This was an obvious waste of money and accommodations, and it was therefore proposed that female pupils should be annually introduced during this intermediate period. Accordingly, school-girls, like other flowers, blossomed in summer only; and this state of things lasted, with but slight modification, for some forty years, according to the School Superintendent's Third Report. It was not till 1828 that all distinctions wire abolished in the Boston Common Schools; in the High Schools lingering far later, sole vestige of the ' good old times,' before a mistaken economy overthrew the wholesome doctrine of M. Sylvain Marechal, and let loose the alphabet among women.
It is true that Eye ruined us all, according to the ology, without knowing her letters. Still, there is something to be said in defence of that venerable ancestress. The Veronese lady, Isotta Nogorola, five hundred and thirty-six of whose learned letters were preserved by De Thou, composed a dialogue on the question, Whether Adam or Eve had committed the greater sin? But Ludovico Domenichi, in his 'Dialogue on the Nobleness of "Women,' maintains that Eve did not sin at all, because the was not even created when Adam was told not to tat the apple. It is ' in Adam all died,' he shrewdly says; nobody died in Eve;-which looks plausible. Be that as it may, Eve's daughters are in danger of swallowing a whole harvest of forbidden fruit, in these revolutionary days, unless something be done to cut of the supply. 
It has-been seriously asserted that, during the last half-century, more books have been written by women and about women than during all the previous uncounted ages. It maybe true; although, when we think of the innumerable volumes of Memoires by Frenchwomen of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,-each one justifying the existence of her own ten volumes by the remark, that all her contemporaries were writing as many,-we have our doubts. As* to the increased multitude of general treatises on the female sex, however,-its education, life, health, diseases, charms, dress, deeds, sphere, rights, wrongs, work, wages, encroachments, and idiosnycrasies generally,-there can be no doubt whatever; and the poorest of these books recognizes a condition of public sentiment which no other age ever dreamed of. Still, literary history preserves the names of some reformers before the Reformation, in this matter. There was Signora Mcderata Fonte, the Venetian, who left a book to be published after her death, in 1592, Dei Meritidelle Donne.' There was her townswoman, Lucrezia Marinella, who followed ten years after, with her essay, ' La Nobilita e la Eccelczea delle Donne, con Difetti e Mancamenti degli Uomini,'-a comprehensive theme, truly! Then followed the all-accomplished Anna Maria Schurman, in 1645, with her ' Dissertatio de Ingenii Muliebris ad Doctrinam et meliores Literas Aptitudine,' with a few miscellaneous letters appended, in Greek and Hebrew. At last came boldly Jacquette Guillaume, in 1665, and threw down the gauntlet in her title-page, ' Les Dames Illustres; ou par bonnes et fortes liaisons il se prouve que le Sexe Feminin surpasse en toute Sorte de Genre le Sexe Masculin,' and with her came Margaret Boufflet and a host of others; and finally, in England, Mary Wollstonecraft, whose famous book, formidable in its day, would seem rather conservative now,-and in America, that pious and worthy dame, Mrs. H. Mather Crocker, Cotton Mather's grandchild, who, in 1818, published the first book on the 'Bights of Woman,' ever written on this side the Atlantic.
Meanwhile there have never been wanting men, and strong men, to echo these appeals. From Cornelius Agrippa and his essay (1509) on the excellence of woman and her pre-eminence over man, down to the first youthful thesis of Agassiz, 'Men's Feminae Viri Animo superior,' there has been a succession of voices crying in the wilderness. In England, Anthony Gibson wrote a book, in 1599, called ' A-Woman's Woorth, defended against all the Men in the World, proouing them to be more Perfect, Excellent, and Absolute in all Vertuous Actions than any Man of what Qualitie soever, Interlarded with Poetry. Per contra, the learned Acidalius published a book in Latin, and afterwards in French, to prove that women are not reasonable creatures. Modern theologians are at worst merely sub-acid, and do not always say so, if they think so. Mean while most persons have been content to leave the world to go on its old course, in this matter as in others, and have thus acquiesced in that stern judicial decree, with which Timons of Athens sums up all his curses upon womankind,-'If there sit twelve women at the table, let a dozen of them be-as they are.'
Ancient or modern, nothing in any of these discussions is so valuable as the fact of the discussion itself. There is no discussion where there. is no wrong. Nothing so indicates wrong as this morbid self-inspection. The complaints are a perpetual protest, the defences a perpetual confession. It is too late to ignore the question, and once opened, it can be settled only on absolute and permanent principles., There is a wrong; but where? Does woman already know too much, or too little?. Was she created for man's subject, or his equal? Shall she have the alphabet, or not? 

THE CHAPLAIN QUESTION.
Memorial for the Abolition of the office of Chaplain in the United States Army and Navy.
In the House of Representatives, December 21st., Mr. Jones, of Tennessee, presented the following memorial of Samuel P. Sparks and 14 others:
The undersigned, citizens of the state of Missouri, deeming the employment of a large number of chaplains or national clergy by Congress and through its authority, at the expense of the government, a serious violation of bar rights of conscience, and of those principles of religious and civil equality and freedom, sought to be protected by the provisions of our national Constitution, respectfully call your attention to some of their reasons for asking the immediate abolition of the office of national chaplain in Congress, in the army and navy, and elsewhere.
<c04>
1. By-article tenth of amendments, the Constitution provides that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively or to the people, 'and the right of employing clergymen to preach or pray for the people, or any portion of them, not being delegated to Congress, either directly or constructively, we claim as a reserved right, which we deem sacred, inalienable, and absolutely essential to our civil and religious freedom.-2. By article one of amendments, the Constitution provides that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,' and we deem the employment of a clergyman of any sect an establishment, to a certain extent, of the religion of that sect, inasmuch as he is thereby made an officer of government; the doctrines preached by him in his official capacity must be considered those of the government, whose acknowledged agent he is, and by, whom he is paid for promulgating his sectarian views, with money drawn from the whole people, nine-tenths of whom, perhaps, hold sentiments entirely at variance with those they are thus by law compelled to support. ' .
3. By article six, section three, the Constitution declares that,' No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States,' and from the very nature of the office of chaplain, a religious test is an indispensable prerequisite to determine the qualification of a candidate therefor, as the employment of a non-pro feesor of religion, or an avowed Infidel, to such an office, would be an inevitable absurdity. Such an office of public trust is most clearly unconstitutional. It is an office to which all citizens are not equally eligible without a religious test, as contemplated by that instrument, from which alone Congress derives all its rightful powers.
4. The immense increase of the number of chaplains employed by the government within the past few years, has alarmed us to apprehend that an extension of the system may ultimately subject us to all the onerous and oppressive features of the unholy union of Church and State, with which the world has been go grievously burdened in all ages, and from which we had hoped we were forever delivered by the glorious epoch of the American Revolution. The report of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives to the Thirty-third Congress, at its first session, on the subject of the numerous petitions for the abolition of the chaplaincy, shows that the number of national clergy which the citizens of our country are annually forced to support, by direct taxation, is as follows; Thirty in the army; twenty-four in the navy, and two in Congress; besides a large number at the various naval and military, schools, stations, and out-posts; and at various missionary stations, ostensibly as teachers of Indian schools. The aggregate amount which we are annually compelled to pay for the support of clergymen, as officers which the Constitution gives Congress no power to create or impose upon us, but, on the contrary, positively prohibits, cannot, therefore, vary far from a quarter of a million of dollars annually! Should the number of national chaplains continue to increase in the ratio of the last few years,] it will soon equal that of the national clergy in the despotisms of the Old World, where the Church and State are allies in corruption and oppression. Indeed, we know of no stopping-place or limit that can be set to arrest its progress, when precedent has! overthrown the protective barriers of the Constitution.
We cannot perceive why clergymen should be sustained . by government in either House of Congress, at our military and naval stations, on board our vessels of war, and in each regiment of our army, any more than in each township, district, parish or village throughout the land; and to sanction the former could not be regarded otherwise than as an assent to the extension of the same system that would place us upon a level with the priest-ridden despotisms of the Old World. Our members of Congress, military and naval officers, soldiery and seamen are or should be paid a just compensation for their services, and be left, like all other citizens, to support any clergymen, or none, as their consciences may direct them, without legal agency or coercion. Neither Christianity nor the genius of our institutions contemplates any aristocracy predicated upon the clerical profession, and no special provision, therefore, is necessary by the government to admit clergymen to our army and navy, as they may enlist like other men, and labor like Jesus himself and his apostles among the poor fishermen on the seaside. If it be objected that few clergymen would serve among I the troops and marines upon such terms, we can only say that, if actuated by correct religious motives, no minister would wait for government gold to lead him to his labors of love among them, and that none but hypocrites would be debarred by the want of it. We think the government should not evince more religious zeal than professed ministers of the gospel themselves, by bribing them to perform religious service. If the clergy in the army and navy look for other compensation than the voluntary contributions of those among whom they labor, the various religious societies of the country might be more appropriately appealed to, as their funds are voluntarily contributed for such purposes, while those of the government are taken for state purposes, ¦ by authority of law, equally from all classes of citizens, of whatever sects, and whether professors or non-professors of religion.
6. Believing that religion is a matter entirely between man and his Maker, with which no human government has a right to meddle, and that its true exercise mu6t be voluntary, it is equally humiliating and painful to us, as Christians and as citizens, to find the barbarous system of persecution, which characterized the dark ages, employed at this day in our army and navy, to compel attendance upon the religious services of our rational clergy. Among the many cases of the kind may be instanced the recent one of the private Duggan, who was sentenced by court-martial, at Fort Columbus, New York harbor, for neglecting to attend the chaplain's religious services, after having been frequently punished for the same offence, to a fine of five dollars per month for six months, the torture of the ball and chain for four months, and partial starvation upon bread and water during the remaining two months of solitary imprisonment. We rejoice that a portion of this sentence was remitted by the clemency of the department, but deeply regret that any religious persecution whatever is authorised by the government, or rendered necessary by military discipline, by the employment of clergymen as government officers to perform religious services in the army and navy.
7. While we reverence religion as a Divine institution, only claiming the free exercise of our own consciences concerning it, we believe that all attempts of human governments to foster it will result similarly to that of Constantine, in its corruption and great detriment, and in rearing an ecclesiastical aristocracy of hireling hypocrites who will assume the clerical character from unholy motives, and ultimately lead to all the oppressive proscription, imposition, and persecutions which have resulted from the same policy in the Roman and all other European governments.
We, therefore, earnestly pray your honorable bodies to carefully consider the unconstitutionality, injustice and oppression of the national chaplaincy system, and to abolish the office of chaplain wherever it may exist by your authority, thereby restoring us the liberty of contributing our own money for such religious and charitable purposes only as our consciences may approve.

From the Portland 'Malne Temperance journal'
REV. DR. NEALE'S LEOTURE.
We are not very apt to be over captious about what people ay or do. Our own good nature always leads us to commend rather than censure. Toe tint gratifies us, the other pains. Bat fidelity to the public, and the good cause we have under our especial charge, demands that we should not permit anything we see, calculated to do mischief, to escape without rebuke, however much it might gratify our feelings to refrain. This is just where we stand with reference to Mr. Neale's lecture. It gives us no pleasure to say what a sense of duty to the public, and fidelity to temperance, compels as to say about some things in that lecture.
The lecture we refer to was delivered before the Mercantile Library Association, on Wednesday evening, the 2d ult. by Rev. R. H. Neale, D. D., of Boston. We did not hear the lecture, bat we did hear of some passages in it with surprise, and we did hope to find there was some mistake about the matter. But we find the very worst confirmed. The last Portland Transcript is before us, containing a report of the lecture, and there we find the very passages to which exception is taken. We can, therefore, no longer doubt their genuineness. The passages are these:
I took but a small carpet-bag, in one side of which was a change of linen, and in the other-shall I tell-a beefs tongue, a Bologna sausage, and a bottle of
brandy!-the latter for medicine, of course. Mr. Dow would excuse me, for he would have done the same.
At the village of Ramleh, we called on the U. S. Consul, a surly Arab, who could speak no English nor French, and would give us nothing to eat. It was then that the beef's tongue came in play! I gave him a drop of brandy, and that warmed his heart, and he began to show us his insignia of office.'
Such a performance might be very benefiting for a reckless collegian; but it strikes us as not at all becoming in a Doctor of Divinity. And then the public narration of such a transaction in any terms would be quite bad enough; but when rented in the flippant manner it is here done, and accompanied with club-room flings, is utterly inexcusable in a gentleman occupying the position of the lecturer. It was a direct insult offered to the temperance men present.
It was for ' medicine, of course! Mr. Dow would excuse me, for he would have done the same thing.' As for Mr. D. he can speak for himself; but how Mr. N. came by the authority to decide so dogmatically as to what be would do, in such a case, the public may be somewhat carious to know. ' Medicine, of course,' may be designed as a witticism; but it betrays his associations, and comes with a very bad grace from one occupying the position he always has been understood to occupy, with reference to the temperance reform.
‘I gave him a drop of brandy, and that warmed his heart!' This we suppose was the kind of medical use for which he took the brandy! just the sort of use that any wag and brandy-drinker would put it to-to warm his own heart, and those of his companions! What will the sober and considerate temperance men think of such doings for a D. D. to engage in? We think it will require a very broad sacerdotal robe-wider than the robes of the Pharisees-to cover up such a transaction, and make it befitting the clerical character.
But the worst feature in this thing is the influence it is calculated to exert on the minds of young men. What does such a procedure, by a man in his position, say to all the young men who heard and may hear of the narration of that transaction? Most obviously, that the temperance men are over-nice in their notions, and that, after all, there is nothing very bad in carrying about in their satchels bottles of brandy, and treating all persons they may meet, whose hearts they may wish to warm up! And what would be the result of such a practice? Simply to open wide the door to all the old drinking habits which entailed such fearful evils on the community, and in their very worst form. When reduced to its elements, it presents the very wont features of the use of liquors. It is using it to answer a purpose, the some as the libertine, the gambler, the sharper, and the horse-jockey. They use it to warm the hearts of those they wish to operate on.
We do not mean to be understood to intimate, that we suppose that Mr. N. saw the matter in this light; but simply to say such is the aspect under which it will be viewed by the very ones who wish for an excuse for their practices, and are most to be injured by such an example. It was just one of those inconsiderate, off-hand sort of things which a good man might well be ashamed of, and which should never be named, and will not bear to be talked about by any man of standing in society. And we hope this gentleman will review this whole matter, and then say whether he thinks such a transaction is becoming the character of a D. D.; and whether, being done, it is calculated to exert such an influence on the community as is desirable, to have the thing paraded before a public audience in the flippant way this was, and especially before oar young men. 'If D. D.’s may warm the hearts of those they meet with brandy, why may not we do the same, and warm our own too?' says every reckless young man.

FOLLIES IK DRESS, AND THEIR CURE.
DRESSES FOR THE STREET.-The New York ladies of indisputable ton and fashion have adopted the English custom, and now wear only the plainest dresses on the promenade. No fashion has been more ridiculed by foreign travellers than the habit once so prevalent among our ladies, of going abroad in the mud and wet in silks and satins, and the reform so much needed is now in progress.-Exchange.
Can anybody tell us what propriety, taste, fitness or common sense there is in having dresses at all that cannot be worn in the street? What does a sensible person, male or female, want of dress more loan plain, serviceable cloth, tastily cat and tidily worn, will subserve? We would like to have any one who values his or her reputation for common sense, and yet indulges in costly dress, answer this question. For our part, we esteem no man or woman but for their genuine good qualities of soul, and their degree of culture; and we never knew any bat simpletons who really loved better or respected more, for their richness of dress, any person among their acquaintances.
The truth about female apparel is, that it is capricious in the extreme, often fantastic, almost always unsuitable, and therefore unbecoming, and unfavorable to health. From the crown of the head to the sole of the foot, woman's dress is an absurd thing. The head-dress does not cover the head, the foot-dress is no protection to the foot. The skirt is hooped out like an umbrella, so that two women meeting upon the sidewalk, can scarcely pass, if the walk be not amply wide. A full dressed lady at a party takes up the room of three, and Betty's hoops among the tables and chairs in the kitchen go lilting and bouncing about like a great blown bladder on the billows. In the street, Madam's silk trail disgustingly in the filth, or she is obliged to lift them immoderately high. Of the two evils, many choose the former.
These things we speak of are admitted to be extremes; persons of more knowledge and sense preserve a mean between one extreme and another of fashion. Still, however, they countenance the mode. How much better if they would refuse to recognize silly fashions at all, and set an example of good taste and real sense! If a woman has the instruments of locomotion-it was for a long time a question whether she had; but we believe that question has at length been settled-she should dress so that she could use them as freely as nature demands. If she is liable to take cold and engender disease in her system through wet feet, she should cover those extremities with thick, warm, serviceable shoes or boots.
But such preaching as this of ours will never be listened to from a conviction of its justice and truth. Men and women-for both are alike to blame-must know more than they do now-a-days before these evils can be cured. Reason always was, and always will be, sacrificed to feeling, while feeling is uninstructed. As long as Angelina thinks that a bonnet which does not cover her head is pretty, so considered by William and Henry and the rest, so long she will wear it in defiance of argument and conviction. Let Angelina alone, then; and let the benefactors of humanity address themselves to parents and teachers, and when wholesome truths enough about humanity are got into the comprehension of such,-when a thorough knowledge of phrenology and physiology, such as Mr. Butler is imparting these winter evenings at his rooms in Washington street, is common property,-correcting, as it will, a thousand errors of thought and habit in society,-then, and not till then, can it be hoped that human beings will drew rationally. Nor do we apprehend, from the signs of the times, that that day is very far distant.-East Boston Ledger.

From the (Ohio) Anti-Slavery Bugle. 
WHERE TO GET THE FACTS.
A Correspondent writes to us for well authenticated documents, exhibiting the actual relation of the Methodist Episcopal Church to slavery. He sends for these, because one of the ministers of this church recently asserted in the pulpit that the Methodist Episcopal church has no connection with slavery; That the assertion that they had such connection was a lie.
The man who made this declaration is either an ignoramus, unacquainted with the actual relation of the church to slavery, or he is a jesuitical knave, striving to build up his church by misrepresentation and falsehood. The official organs of his church, the record of the general and the annual conferences, and the testimony of a multitude of ministers and church members, convict him of falsehood in making this assertion. These authorities have all repeatedly admitted that actual slaveholding exists in the church.
That not only its private members but its stewards, exhorters and ministers are bona fide slave owners and slaveholders; that its ministers have offered rewards through the public papers for the hunting and returning of fugitive slaves; and that very recently official members of the church participated
approvingly in a popular convention in Maryland,. the avowed object of which was the expulsion or enslavement of the whole colored population of state.
But even if this was not true, still as our correspondent well remarks, the fact that the church is pro-slavery, is abundantly sustained by other considerations. He says, 'I, for my part, regard the church as pro-slavery as long as it admits slavery to be an evil, and refuses to denounce it from the pulpit as such.'
But to our correspondent's inquiry, as to Where the evidence of the actually existing facts are to be found, we reply: that we have given in our columns an overwhelming mass of them from time to time and so well authenticated that no reasonable man' can doubt the evidence. But we advise him all who, like him, would confound the clerical falisfiers of facts on this subject, to enclose fifty cents in potage stamps, to the Editor of the Northern Independent, at Auburn, New York, accompanied with the request to send on the pamphlet recently published by Rev. Mr. M'Cartney, and also Rev. Mr. Marttisons late work-The Crisis. Do this, and you will have in your hands authentic testimony with, which you can overwhelm and confound all such reverend falsifiers as the one of whom our correspondent complains. 
The correspondence referred to was merely a private note have, therefore, omitted all reference to persons and places, but have made this public statement, that others besides our correspondent may know where to look for facts.
Send on for the documents.

Ayer's Sarsaparilla,
A compound remedy, in which we have labored to produce the most effectual alterative that can be made. It is a concentrated extract of Para Sarsa parilla, so combined with other substances of still greater alterative power as to afford an effective antidote for the diseases Sarsaparilla is reputed to cure. It is believed that such a remedy is wanted by those who suffer from Strumous complains, and that one which will accomplish their cure must prove of immense service to this large class of our afflicted fellow-citizens. How completely this compound will do it has been proven by experiment on many of the worst cases to be found of the following complaints':-
SCROFULA AND SCROFULOUS COMPLAINTS, ERUPTIONS AND ERUPTIVE DISEASES, ULCERS, PIMPLES, BLOTCHES, TUMORS, SALT RHEUM, SCALD HEAD, SYPHILIS AND SYPHILITIC AFFECTIONS, MERCURIAL DISEASE, DROPSY, NEURELGIA OR TIC DOULOUREEI, DEBILITY, DYSPEPSIA AND INDIGESTION, ERYCIPSLAS, ROSE OR ST. ANTHONY’S FIRE, and indeed the whole class of complaints arising from IMPURITT OF THE BLOOD.
This compound will be found a great promoter of health, when taken in the spring, to expel the foul humors which fester in the blood at that season of the year. By the timely expulsion of them any rankling disorders are nipped in the bud. Multitudes can, by the aid of this remedy, spare themselves from the endurance of foul eruptions and ulcerous sores, through which the system will strive to rid itself of corruptions, if not assisted to do this through the natural channels of the body by an alterative medicine. Cleanse out the visited blood whenever you find its impurities bursting through the skin in pimples, eruptions, or sores cleanse it when you find it is obstructed and sluggish in the veins; cleanse it whenever it is foul, and your feelings will tell you when. Even where no particular disorder is felt, people enjoy better health, and live longer, for cleansing the blood. Keep the blood healthy, and all is well; but with this pabulum of life disordered, there can be no lasting health. Sooner or later something must go wrong, and the great machinery of life is disordered or overthrown.
Sarsaparilla has, and deserves much, the <illegible> of accomplishing these ends. But the world has been egregiously deceived by preparations of fit partly because the drug alone has not all the virtue that is claimed for it, but more because many preparations, pretending to be concentrated extracts of it, contain but little of the virtue of Sarsaparilla of any thing else.
During late years the public have been misled by large bottles, pretending to give a quart of Ex tract of Sarsaparilla for one dollar. Most of these have been frauds upon the sick, for they not only contain little, if any, Sarsaparilla, but often no curative properties whatever. Hence, bitter and painful disappointment has followed the use of the various extracts of Sarsaparilla-which flood the market, until the name itself is justly despised and has become synonymous with imposition and that Still we call this compound Sarsaparilla, an data to supply such a remedy as shall rescue the name from the load of obloquy which rests upon it. And we think we have ground for believing it has virtues which are irresistible by the ordinary run of the diseases it is intended to cure. In order to secure their complete eradication from the system the remedy should be judiciously taken according to directions on the bottle.

REFUGE OF OPPRESSION.
<c01>
From the Boston Post.
WENDELL PHILLIPS.
This abolition orator has again made his appearance on the platform of disunion and death, before a Committee on Federal Relations, in support of a petition asking for a law to prevent the recapture of fugitive slaves, and in a speech of the most nefarious character has labored to prove to the people of this Commonwealth and of New England, that there has been on obligation on them individually, or the State government, to obey the Constitution, or to regard as binding upon them any law passed by Congress, by virtue of the authority of that instrument, since the Missouri Compromise.
Phillips, the oracle of the higher law theory, has attempted to satisfy the people at large, that they have been paying fealty to a power long since defunct, continuing to exist upon the wires of political doctors, who have contrived by their skill to dress up the skeleton in such a manner as to give it the appearance of life, and to palm it off as a living thing. Mr. Phillips has, doubtless, in the judgment of his followers, raised a knell that must summon slavery to heaven or to hell; he has stated that every nine in ten voters, provided the bill in question should be referred to them, would rush to the ballot-box to support it. Oh, most knowing Phillips! And again: he wants the State to resist this statute, and if it is outside of the Constitution, and most certain, should an attempt be made to enforce it, to raise a talk which our orator himself would find greatly to his discomfort and disadvantage; although it is believed he can accommodated himself to almost any disorder, so that the result promises to be a larger liberty. Freedom! that is the idea; the one-string harp this gentleman plays so well, that chaos may come, and from the general despair that he may find himself famous for covering the land with darkness. But, seriously, what does this gentleman expect to accomplish by placing the State in open rebellion against the general government?
Admitting all that he says to be true in reference to the Constitution as a contract being null and void in consequence of the action of both sections of the country, is this sufficient reason why he should seek to prevent a return to the kindly spirit in which it was formed by the statement of the past? Under the mere pretence, too, of saving the fugitive from restoration to the service of his master. Does be not know that the South are more sensitive on this point than any other, and that when the counsels the State to pass an act over-riding the constitutional rights of Southern men to arrest their escaped negroes upon our soil, and carry them to the place from whence they came, that he counsels a wrong, which, if resulting in a disruption of the Union, will place him and his co-workers on the scourges of mankind? We have no disposition to follow him through his speech, or to sift his arguments. It is enough to say that he desires to infect the New England mind with the idea that it is not merely their moral and religious duty, but their political right to make a law which cannot be enforced so long as there is any authority at Washington to resist it. 'Enact that bill,' says he, 'and if it is set aside, enact it again-and if it is again set aside, enact it a third time, and be certain that when the law comes from the rotunda of the Capitol, if the people do not make it effectual through the Supreme Court, they will make it effectual over that Court; for the humanity! of the people-(mark that!) will be represented by the institutions of Massachusetts in some form or other.' Oh, yes, Mr. Phillips! The humanity of Massachusetts, under your precious instructions, is to be forced into conflict with the general government, and all because your woolly horse, which you ride so gallantly, is not made a pet of at Washington. The humanity of Massachusetts, indeed. that is a sentiment we trost which all citizens of the Bay State too well understand to make such a misapplication of, as you would have them, and to which infamous end, all the energies of your natural and acquired talents have been for years, and continue to be devoted. Who and what is this interest that this stalwart champion of liberty has so near at heart, and would wreck all other interests to defend? Is it the honor of Massachusetts? No; is it the material welfare of the State? No; is it the spiritual welfare? No; if it is not the welfare of the State in any of its classes and ramifications, what in the name of common sense can it be, that thus moves the gentleman? Why, it is the outside of the Constitution-he has got behind' that, and sitting himself down like a frog, begins to croak about a liberty not in the Constitution; and having placed himself outside of this domicil, comfortable though it is, calls upon Massachusetts to follow him, and enjoy the right of making all men free upon our soil. And for this fun, Messrs. Phillips & Co. are willing to 'let the Union slide.' What a set of frogs, to be sure; we think it will be leap-frog in good earnest, when that time comes.
We admire all men who battle for the right, when untold evils do not threaten their zeal; when such is the case, they may be said, in common parlance, to run things into the ground.
To suppose for a moment that the people of the South will yield their right to arrest fugitives, and carry them back from whence they came, is absurd; the South is more determined now than ever on this right, since it is sought so persistently to deprive them of it.
We have our doubts as to the great preponderance of voters in Massachusetts being in favor of any such law as Mr. Phillips advocates; his hopes are too sanguine. We feel quite sure that the men of this State, let them hate as they may the institution of slavery, and the constitutional requirements of the rendition of fugitives, are by no means prepared to make an issue with the authorities at Washington, as to the right of the south to take from our soil the fugitive held to service in a slave State. If such, however, shall prove to be the action of our people, we have only to say that they pursue a shadow which is leading them to a fatal fall. If the contract by which we became a Union has not been faithfully executed, the North are as much to blame as the South, and have as much to atone for. Therefore, for Mr. Phillips to set up the plea of a breach of contract, as good ground for annihilating what little good faith does remain, instead of trying to restore the integrity of the Constitution, is criminal in the extreme, and indicates either a very bad heart, or a badly diseased brain. If he is such a humanitarian-such a lover of his race, (indeed, all now,) as he would have us believe-why does he not take a common sense rational view of things, and finding that the evil he combats cannot be knocked down without sad results, go to work gently and fairly to overcome the obnoxious presence, by such means as unite a true philanthropy with a high manhood? It is not wise to crowd the South; she has held a share of power too long in this government, now that she is being eclipsed by the North, submit to insult. She will yield, and gracefully to the operation of natural causes, tending to build up the North, and place the government in its
<c02>
hands; but touch her honor, wound her pride by insult, by taking undue advantage of a prosperity which she has sided in gaining for us, and what other result can follow, than a hatred of the most hitter nature? Let the people of New England consider carefully the precise state of the case, and remember. that however much they may he attached to negro liberty, a forbearance of that attachment where Southern rights are involved is imperative, I order to preserve our free institutions, and encourage the growth of liberal government in Europe! If a rupture of our political relations with the South should occur, through any execss. at the North of fellow-feeling for the slave, we shall find our gain on the score of humanity nothing, and our political loss incalculable. We say again, our only safety is in Union, and manly dealings with the South upon the question of slavery. She has the right of going into any territory belonging to the United States with her negroes, and of reclaiming, in any free State, all such property when found, and proved; those rights cannot, and ought not to be restricted; the South may surrender them as a matter of compromise, but they cannot be denied her under the Constitution. She agreed to that contract in consideration of those privileges, and she will, we trust, be permitted to remain in the undisturbed possession of them. W.A.C.

NULLIFYING THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW.
We deeply regret that the Committee on Federal Relations should have lent their sanction to the bill to prohibit the rendition of fugitive slaves, which was reported to the House last Friday. The scheme is so full of mischief, and so inoperative for any practical good, that while we acquite the majority of the Committee of any improper motives in reporting it, and readily admit that many honest men may be led unthinkingly to approve of it, we cannot help suspecting that sinister designs have had something to do with its origin and development. We are confident that the people of a Massachusetts want nothing of the kind. Their record is too clear, their present position too commanding, the auguries of their future too bright to need any such strained and futile legislation as that proposed.
But we do not purpose at this time to open any elaborate controversy on the matter. There will be time enough for that, should we prove mistaken in our expectation that the Legislature will quietly dispose of the Committee's action when it comes up in course. We now throw out only a few obvious considerations, lest erroneous conclusions might possibly be derived from our silence.
The Fugitive Slave Law is manifestly about as near a 'dead letter' in Massachusetts as any statute can well be. Whatever may be the reasons for this, we are quite contented with the fact. Two slaves have been returned, under circumstances which will probably never occur again. How many have been escaping every year across our soil-neither starved nor means of ascertaining. It was recently stated in the Assembly of New York, that 176 fugitives had passed through Albany in seven months ending with the 1st of January last; and this statement probably gives a fair hint of what is going on in this State. The fugitives, therefore, do not ordinarily require any more favor than they now receive Perhaps if the proposed bill should be passed, the only effect would be to detain a large proportion of the fugitives as residents here, and to attract hither many who would otherwise seek Canada through the other Northern States. Would our permanent population be benefited by this addition? Would the fugitives gain anything by giving up an absolutely safe retreat for one which would never be free from alarms, and could only assure security at the expense of commotion and bloodshed?
We assume that the proposed bill comes into direct collision with the Constitution of the United States. No man in whom sophistry has not taken the place of common sense, will dream of saying the contrary. It only needs that the two things be put together. It only needs that the two things be put contrary. For instance, the Constitution says; 
'No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws there of, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.
Now the proposed bill says:
'Whoever shall arrest, imprison, or carry out of this Commonwealth, or shall attempt to arrest, imprison, or carry out of this Commonwealth, any person for the alleged reason that such person owes service or labor, as a slave, to the party claiming him, shall be punished by imprisonment, in the State Prison, not exceeding five years.'
Did ever two railroad trains headed towards each other on the same track, come into a more dead collision than will these two clauses, in case the letter should be made a law? Did ever a hand-car encounter a fully equipped locomotive train with so many chances of having its own way, as would a State statute started into operation with the avowed purpose of overriding the Constitution of the United States? We make no argument on this point, because there is room for none. It is too late in the day-and would always have been very foolish-to eontend that the above clause of the Constitution does not refer to slaves. Even Mr. Garrison will resort to no such delusion, but, in admitting the clear meaning of the phraseology, also says:
'Enough that, for seventy years, all the Courts, all the Legislatures, all the Congresses, and all the people have understood these compromises of the Constitution in precisely the same way, and pronounced them obligatory. It is too late, therefore, to get up a new and unwarrantable construction of the Constitution.'
There are many minor considerations which we might notice, if we thought it necessary. Thus, we might point out the discreditable estimate which the act seems to put on human liberty. The first section declares in substance that every person coming into the Commonwealth is a freeman; but, according to the second section, the penalty for reducing such freeman to bondage is imprisonment 'not exceeding five years'! It would thus be proclaimed to the world that, in Massachusetts, the taking away of a man's liberty is a crime on the same penal level with that of receiving stolen goods! Into such inconsistencies does unthinking radicalism sometimes impel men. Into what political inconsistencies and disadvantages we should be driven by the adoption of this bill, we will not now examine. It is sufficient that the propassed actions is clearly and grossly unconstitutional. We will go as far as any in upholding and developing the free sentiment which has ever been the glory of Massachusetts, and we will not stop to inquire whether the path leader through good report or evil report. But the moment it trenches upon the grand constitutional limits to which we and our fathers have assented, we pause. We know that to go forward is such cams us against ascred pledges, is a wrong to our sister States, is setting an example full of mischievous in fluences is not only taking a position incapable of being sustained, but is striking a blow which will fearfully recoil upon the very cause whish prompts it.

SELECTIONS.
From the Christian Examiner for March.
CONDITION OF THE FREE COLORED
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.
BY REV. JAMES FREEMAN CLARKE.
(Concluded.)
The treatment of the free colored people in the Store States is far more oppressive than in the Free. There, they are not only disliked, but also feared. Yet, though the laws against them are more severe than at the North, their opportunities for prospering are greater. In both respects their condition in the Slave States is analogous to that of the Jews in Mediaeval Europe. Hated and trampled on, they were still needed; they were an essential element in the business of society, and therefore they prospered.
The tyranny exercised over the free colored people in the Slave States may be illustrated by a few facts.
1. Every colored man, living in a Slave State, is by law presumed to be a slave. Thus the law of South Carolina of 1740, providing the way by which persons held as slaves and claiming to be free shall bring suit for freedom, says: 'Provided, that in any action or suit, &c., the burden of proof shall lay upon the plaintiff, and it shall always be presumed that every negro, Indian, mulatto, and mestizos is a slave, unless the contrary be made to appear.' The law of Georgia, 1770, is a copy of this. And in both acts it is added, that, if the plaintiff does not succeed in his suit, the court may inflict on him any corporal punishment not extending to life or limb.
This doctrine, says Stroud, which presumes every colored man to be a slave, obtains in all the Slave States except North Carolina, where it is confined to negroes of whole blood, while with mulattoes, &c. the presumption is in favor of freedom.
2. Any colored person who cannot prove his freedom by documentary evidence is liable to be imprisoned, and sold as a slave to pay his jail fees.
Such is the law of nearly all of the Slave States.
3. In many Slave States it is contrary to law to teach a free colored parson to read and write. In Virginia, according to the code of 1849, 'every assemblage of negroes for the purpose of instruction in reading and writing shall be an unlawful assembly,' and the punishment for being present at it is stripes. The punishment of the white person who teaches negroes is fine and imprisonment. Under this law, Mrs. Margaret Douglass was sentenced in 1854 by Judge Baker to pay one hundred dollars, and be imprisoned one month in the common jail of Norfolk.
South Carolina has a similar law, declaring any assembly of slaves, free negroes, or mulattoes, for mental instruction, an unlawful meeting. (Law of 1800.) So in Georgia. (Act of 1833.) So in Alabama. (Clay's Digest, act of 1832.)
4. In many Slave States the free colored person is obliged by law to submit, without resistance, to any amount of injury inflicted by a white man.
Thus a law of Louisiana declares that 'free persons of color ought never to insult or to strike white people, nor presume to conceive themselves equal to the whites; but, on the contrary, they ought to yield to them on every occasion, and never speak to or answer them but with respect, under the penalty of imprisonment,' &c.
In Maryland (Act of 1723) a justice of the peace may direct a free colored man's ears to be cropped for striking a white man. The white man may be a robber, a murderer, a man mad with drink,-he may be committing violent outrage on the colored man's wife or daughter,-but he must not strike him!
In Kentucky the law runs, that, 'if any negro, mulatto, or Indian, bond or free, shall at any time lift his or her hand in opposition to any person not being a negro, mulatto, or Indian, he or she so offending shall receive thirty lashes on his or her bare back, well laid on.'
In Washington City, says Mr. Olmsted, in April, 1855, twenty-four 'genteel colored men' (so they were called) were found by a watchman privately assembling in the evening, and were lodged in a watch-house.
'The object of their meeting appears to have been purely benevolent, and when they were examined before a magistrate in the morning, no evidence was offered, nor does there seem to have been any suspicion, tout they had any criminal purpose. On searching their persons, there were found a Bible; a volume of Seneca's Morals; Life in Earnest; the printed Constitution of a Society, the object of which was said to be to relieve the sick, and to bury the dead; and a subscription paper to purchase the freedom of Eliza Howard, a young woman whom her owner was willing to sell for $650.
'I can think of nothing that would speak higher for the character of a body of poor men, servants and laborers, than to find by chance in their pockets just such things as these. And I cannot value that man as a countryman, who does not feel intense humiliation and indignation, when he learns that such men may not be allowed to meet privately together, with such laudable motives, in the capital city of the United States, without being subjected to disgraceful punishment. One of the prisoners, a slave named Joseph Jones, was ordered to be flogged; four others, called in the papers free men, were sent to the workhouse, and the remainder, on paying costs of court, and fines, amounting in the aggregate to one hundred and eleven dollars, were permitted to range loose again.'
The census of 1850 contains some tables designed to show that the proportion of colored convicts in the jails and penitentiaries of the Free States is very large, not only in proportion to the white convicts in the same States, but also to the number of colored convicts in the Slave States. We say designed to show this; for the principle of tabulation indicates the purpose. The purpose is evidently to prove by statistics that freedom is unsuited to the colored race, and that they are much more virtuous in slavery. A similar thing was attempted in the census of 1840. It was then attempted to prove that freedom made the black man insane, blind, and deaf and dumb,-and the tables certainly showed this to be the case. But, on further examination, it appeared that these figures were consummate liars, and that, in many of the localities given, the insane colored people existed only in the figures of the census. It was the census that was insane, and not the colored people. Whether similar blunders, all on the side of slavery, may not have been committed in preparing the tables of 1850, we know not; but we cannot rely fully on the fairness of statement in one like Mr. DeBow, whose principal business in life, down to the time that he was appointed Superintendent of the Census in the place of Mr. Kennedy, was editing a magazine of the most pro-slavery proclivities, and which be still continues to edit. The animus of Mr. DeBow appears in the following sentence (Compend. of 7th Census, p. 86): 'Dwellings and families. These are not ascertained on the slave schedules. The facts, if known, would compare favorably with those of other classes in most moderate circumstances, and especially with the free colored.' 'The facts, if known'! How Mr. De-
<c04>
Row can tell what facts not known would do if they were known, does not appear. All that does appear is this. If he can get any facts which can he made to look as if freedom was an injury and slavery a blessing to the colored man, he parades them in tables. If he cannot get any such facts, he says, 'I have not got them; but if I had them, I know that they would show what a curse freedom is to a colored man.'
Taking, however, these statistics as given by the census, what do they say, at the worst? Here are the free colored people in the Free States. Most of them were once slaves themselves, or the children of slaves. Educated by slavery, if they are vicious, is it slavery or freedom which is responsible for it? Taught by plantation life to lie for defence and to steal for enjoyment, what shall we expect of them when free? Exposed to the brutalities of overseers, confessedly a degraded class,-witnessing the fierce outbreaks of passion which have made the Slave States a 'dark and bloody ground,' shall we expect then to have learned patience and the milder virtues? Shut out from all higher enjoyments, deprived of education and of all refined pleasure, do we think that they should be peculiarly temperate and sober? And when they have come to the Free Slates, or when born in the Free States, what are their opportunities? Prejudice turns them out of the schools into which we invite the children of newly landed foreigners,-prejudice closes against them the occupations open to all others,-prejudice drives then from the public car, steamboat, omnibus. If the free colored man has a genius for invention, and makes a discovery which would enrich a white man, the law says, 'You are not a citizen, you cannot have a patent.' A white shoemaker may become a United States Senator, a white blacksmith Governor of Massachusetts; but when Governor Bashford of Wisconsin issued a commission as Notary Public to H. Nolan, a colored man, the Secretary of State refused to file the paper, and wrote on it, 'This appointment is in violation of the Constitution, and is therefore void.'* Judge Bicknell of Indiana has decided that railroad companies may require colored passengers to produce evidence of their freedom. If the colored man wishes to buy a Western farm, the United States land offices give him no right to enter land, since he is not a citizen. Thus when Christ says, 'The colored people are weak, bear their burdens,' Judge Taney, by his Dred Scott decision, says, 'They are weak, trample them down lower still.' Under these circumstances, what degree of virtue may we fairly expect of them? Put on one side these poor refugees from slavery, uneducated, without money, without a trade, and refused admittance into any, with no hope of a career, conscious of living amid a dark cloud of prejudice. Put on the other side the white population, with its free schools, academics, and colleges, its churches, books, and lectures, its accumulated property, its career opened to all talents. What shall be the respective proportion in jails and penitentiaries from these two classes? Why, from the upper and middle classes of the whites we draw no recruits for the prison. they are almost all taken from the lower fourth.
According to the Compendium of the Census of 1850, the average in the penitentiaries of the Free States was 28 to 10,000 of the free colored persons. Meantime there were 6 or 7 white foreigners to every 10,000 white foreigners, and 2 native whites to 10,000. There were four times as many colored convicts as foreign white, and fourteen times as many as native whites.
But two or three things are to be noticed in this table. The average is 28 convicts to 10,000 colored persons. But in Pennsylvania, which contains 53,000 colored persons, the largest number of any Free State, the average is only 8 to 10,000, scarcely greater than the average of foreign convicts to the foreign population. The inference is, that, as the number of free colored persons increases, crime is diminished among them. But on the other hand, in Vermont, containing only 718 colored persons, there were none in the penitentiary. Yet both these facts are explained by a single consideration. The colored people are social and affectionate; they need sympathy and kindness; they thrive in the sunlight of good-will; they wither in the cold region of neglect or dislike. Where they are numerous, they are kind to each other, and they do well. Where they are treated kindly by the whites, as in Vermont, where there is little prejudice against them, they also do well. There is no race who will repay with better fruits a little good-will than they.
That there should be few colored persons in the penitentiaries in the Slave States is not surprising. Every plantation is a penitentiary for its own slaves. It punishes them, however, not by five or ten years' imprisonment, but by fifty or a hundred lashes. This is much more economical, for they can thus be sent again to work immediately. Few planters would care to lose the service of a slave for five years, by letting him go to the penitentiary.
On the whole, then, we think we may say, that our colored population arc remarkably free from crime, when we consider the disadvantages under which they labor. As long M only 28 in 10,000 commit offences making them liable to the stateprison, we can hardly say that they are vicious, degraded, and criminal as a body. As long as only 89 out of 9,000 were in all the poor-houses of Massachusetts in 1850, we cannot fairly call them a race of paupers. The facts, even when collected and arrayed by those least friendly to them, put down at once the popular sweeping charge of utter worthlessneas. These facts show a people struggling against difficulties, and struggling well; contriving, somehow or other, to get a support, though ninetyfive occupations out of a hundred are closed against them; making sure progress, sending their children to school, and gradually accumulating property and knowledge.
The colored people are to be educated and moved through their social and affectionate nature. Make of them pariahs and outlaws, and you corrupt and degrade them; show them sympathy and kindness, and they repay it a thousand-fold. In all those cities where they are the best treated,-in Cincinnati, and Cleveland, and Columbus,-they are the most prosperous. The feeling toward them in Cleveland, and throughout the Western Reserve, is very kind, and there they do better than in most places. There yon find them master carpenters, master painters, shop-keepers, and growing rich every year.
But what can the colored people of the Free States do to improve their condition? Some say, 4 They ought to go to Africa.' But to this we see objections.
The following seem strong objections to the plan of colonization in Liberia, regarding it either as a plan for getting rid of slavery, or getting rid of toe free colored people of the United States. Regarded merely as a missionary station, or a commercial station in Africa, it is unobjectionable. But regarded as a means of putting an end to Southern slavery, or as a means of removing the free colored people oat of our way, it is liable to very grave objections. These are:-
1. Impracticability. We have in this country, by the last census, 3, 198,324 slaves, and 428,637 free
Madison Democrat, July 16th 1857.
<c05>
colored people To transport this number to Africa would require a hundred millions of dollars, according to the calculations of the Colonization Society. But that is the least difficulty in the matter. How are the free colored people to be made willing to go? How are the masters of the slaves to be made willing to send them? Instead of sending their slaves to Africa, they now clamor for a revival of the slave-trade, to bring more slaves from Africa, If only the annual increase of the black population in the United States, which is about 100,000 a year, were sent to Africa, how would they be provided for after their arrival? The population of Liberia seems to be usually on the Verge of starvation. In 1839, Dr. Bacon, of New Haven, testifies to this: in 1854, Augustus Washington, a missionary of the Colonization Society, testifies to the same thing. Ninety five per cent, he says, of all who come here with nothing, endure suffering and death to an extent almost incredible.
2. Why should they be sent away? They are wanted here as laborers; they are not wanted there. Here, labor is in demand; in Africa, it is in excess. The attraction of high wages has brought to this country within the last ten yean a million and a half of laborers from Europe. How absurd to try to reverse this current, and to send so large a part of our laboring people to Africa.
3. As a missionary work, the plan of sending the colored people to Africa is simply absurd. It they are ignorant, vicious, idle, as you say they are, they ought to be scholars, not teachers. Keep them here in our midst, and let them be educated by the influences around them. Put their children into our schools and churches; let them see and copy our habits of industry and economy, and let them also do something to Christianize us, by teaching us how to love our neighbor as ourselves.
The practical question for the people of the United States is this: Is it more practicable to remove 4,000,000 of colored people to Africa, or to remove the prejudice against them out of our hearts? Many people think the first the easiest, for prejudice to itself always seems something infinite and immortal. Most Americans, who have never met an intelligent colored person on terms of equality, would think it impossible to sit with them at the same table without very disagreeable sensations. But having done so once, they would think it strange that they ever thought it strange to do so.
It is not best for the colored people, we think, to spend much time in conventions, in passing resolutions, or in making speeches. They may resolve ever so often, that the prejudice against them is a wicked one, and may denounce, in ever so eloquent language, the inequalities of their condition. It will do no good. Conventions and resolutions do not make public opinion, they only concentrate and express it. The public opinion in behalf of the colored people is yet to be made. Every colored man who is industrious, virtuous, intelligent, and gentlemanly, helps to make it. Prejudice cannot be talked down, it must be lived down. To talk is easier than to work, but it accomplishes little.
Colored people ought to make money. A colored man who makes a thousand dollars, does more to put down prejudice, than if he made a thousand moderately good speeches against prejudice, or wrote a thousand pretty fair articles against it. No race in this country will be despised which makes money. If we had in Boston or Now York ten orang outangs worth a million dollars each, they would visit in the best society, we should leave our cards at their doors, and give them snug little dinner-parties. We long for the time when there shall be colored people rich as Croesus in every part of this dear New England.
The colored people ought to diversify their occupations. They should not be satisfied with being only barbers, waiters, and sailors. Each one who has a special talent should cultivate it. Let him not try to be a lawyer, unless he can be a good one. Let him not write books, of which we have to say, 'They are very good, considering.' But if he can be first-rate in anything, so as to be the best dentist, or engineer, or artist, or engraver, or gunsmith, or oculist, or reporter, in the place, then those who wish to have their work well done must go to him, and no prejudice will prevent it.
The colored people should educate themselves and their children. They will find that nothing will be worth so much to them as education. In the Free States, the free schools and academies are open to them, and they can have equal advantages with the children of their most prosperous white neighbors. Let them make use of them.
Let them avoid vices of all sorts, and encourage each other to habits of virtue. In Cincinnati, at one time, all the free colored people belonged to the temperance society. Liquor is the great enemy of the race. It makes them mad. And a single crime committed by a colored man does more to increase the prejudice against the race, than all their friends can do to diminish it. When the next United States census appears, let the colored people see that it shall not find a larger proportion of them in the prisons and jails than there is of other races.
Finally, the colored people ought to have faith in God and man. They must not be discouraged because just now they labor under a heavy weight of prejudice. If they are true to themselves, they will surely overcome it. They may for a time be excluded from theatres and lecture-rooms and operas; they may be denied a passport when going abroad, or the protection of their government at home; they may be refused the right of locating lands and receiving the appointment of notary public, or even, as lately, the right of testifying in the courts of justice of the United States. But no matter. They cannot be prevented from leading noble and useful lives, from informing and improving their hearts; and so they wilt be respected and happy when brawling demagogues and slimy statesmen are despised and forgotten.
The people of this country are, in the main, real democrats, not sham democrats. They really believe in an equality of rights before the law for all men. This talk about superior and inferior races will, by and by, disgust them. If they see the colored people show the qualities of men, they will treat them as such.

THE LAW OF GOD AND THE LAW OF MAN
The late Daniel Webster refused to legislate against slavery in New Mexico, because, as ho said, he did not wish to re-enact a law, of God. The physical features of the country, according to his assumption, were an eternal ordinance against slavery, and there was no need, in that case, of human legislation. As well enact that water should not run up hill, or that the earth should turn from east to west, as to pass laws in order to repulse slavery from such a soil and climate as the soil and climate of New Mexico.
Mr. Webster was positive and eloquent on this theme, and all his followers, and a great many who were not his followers, echoed his earnest assurances with evident comfort to themselves, and to the utter confusion of all abolitionists and Wilmot-provisomen. It was suspected at the time that this was a mere dodge behind an alleged divine authority, to escape toe responsibility of a just exercise of human 
<c06>
authority; it was said that Mr. Webster and his party caught at the pretext to screen themselves in the desertion of a policy to which they had before been pledged; but that, it appears, now was a grave injustice, for events have proved that the gentlemen to whom we allude were altogether right. It is true that slavery has gone into New Mexico; it is true that slavery now exists in New Mexico; but the law of God-i. e., the law of soil and climate-is so strong against it that nothing bat the most stringent human law is able to keep it in existence; at least we infer as much from the following synopsis, of a recent statute passed by the territorial legislature:
'The killing or maltreating of a slave is placed on a level with the same offences towards white persons. Kidnapping, stealing or enticing a slave away, or aiding in so doing, or assisting him to escape or secrete himself, is punishable with imprisonment for net less than four nor more than ten years, and one of from $500 to $2,000. To give a slave fabricated freedom papers or induce his absence from his owner, subjects the party to imprisonment, and from $100 to $1,000 fine. To incite or advise to insurrection or furnish weapons to a slave, or traffic with one without permission, are punishable with from three months to three years imprisonment, and with from $25 to $100 fine. The penalty for gambling with a slave is a fine not exceeding $100, or imprisonment not exceeding three months. A reward is provided for apprehending runaways, and the sheriffs are compelled to take care of such when delivered to them, at the risk of being amenable to the owner for the value of the slave, and to take steps for restoring them to their owners, or if no owner comes forward to claim them, to provide for their sale at public vendue.
'It is also provided that the owners of slaves shall be compelled to provide adequately for their maintenance, and shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than one year, or fined not more than $1,000, for inhuman treatment of a slave. This law also provides punishment for slaves convicted of crimes and misdemeanors; forbids negroes or mulattoes giving evidence in courts against whites; prohibits marriages between whites and negroes, and makes all attempts to procure such alliances punishable. The attempt to commit or the committal of a rape upon a white female by a negro or mulatto is made punishable with death. Emancipation of slaves in the territory is totally prohibited. Slaves are not allowed to go off their master's premises after sunset, without a pass. Provision is made for recovery of a slave unlawfully detained from the owners by another person, by replevin, or habeas corpus.
'The act took effect from the date of its passage, which occurred on the 26th of January last.'
These are fundamentally the same provisions as are made in other slave states or territories in which the law of soil and climate does not operate; they look, as in all other cases, like simple devices of selfishness, to protect and maintain a valuable species of property; they look like the ordinary muniments and defences of the 'institution,' which finds the same reasons for its existence in New Mexico that it finds elsewhere; but we presume that they are not to be interpreted in that light, and that they are wilful efforts to counteract the 'natural laws of God.' In this view, we may add, it is very hard that man should not be permitted to legislate in favor of the divine law, while he has such large scope to legislate against it; or that it should be needless or improper for him to aid the efforts of soil and climate, while he is allowed the utmost latitude in countervailing them. In fact, we think that a little timely assistance given to the endeavors of nature, by human enactments, would not have been out of place in New Mexico, in spite of the dictum of Mr. Webster, and the enthusiastic plaudits he received from his friends.
CUBA TAKEN AT TAMMANY HALL!
'A grand Democratic rally to extend the area of freedom,' by acquiring the Island of Cuba, with its extensive population of slaves, was called by the Tammany General Committee for last evening, at Tammany Hall.
The Committee of Arrangements consisted of one delegate from each Ward, and among the number were the following distinguished advocates of freedom:
WILLIAM D. KENNEDY, Soft Politician, Chairman. 
ALFRED CHANCELLOR, small politician and standing candidate for party favors.
WILLIAM BAIRD, Ex-Alderman and proprietor of a Fourth Ward rum-shop.
EDWARD C. MCCONNELL, Ex-Councilman, Ex-A-derman; oNce indicted for assaulting a Duane-street prostitute.
M. TUOMEY, Alderman, rum-seller, and Chairman of the Stump-tail Committee on Swill Milk.
THOS. C. FIELD, Public Administrator, down among the dead men.
JAMES IRVING, friend of J. Morrissey, Esq., suspected of being implicated in the row which resulted in the death of W. Poole, Esq., and late an official in the Street Department, and generally available in a scrimmage.
ALEX. WARD, General Fugleman of the Tammany Committee, and anxious to serve his fellow-citizens.
As usual, the gun was fired, a brass band played, and a bonfire was lighted, and the usual effect was not produced. The unterrified did not turn out, as in duty bound they should, in obedience to party mandates. Not more than eight hundred persons were present at any time.
Of the speakers from abroad who had been announced, only Senator Brown of Mississippi was present.
The platform was ornamented with those distinguished apostles of Freedom, Bill Kennedy. Ike Fowler, Sawyer Rynders, Dan Delevan. Jack Clancy, Corneil Campbell, Mike Halpin, Ned McConnell, Tom Dunlap (late of the Pewter Mug), Dug. Taylor, and the Hon. John Cochrane of 'incarnate devil' fame.
At 8 o'clock. Mr. Chairman KENNEDY called the meeting to order, and announced its object to the 800 advocates of freedom who had assembled. He nominated ANDREW H. MICKLE, ex-Mayor but for many years an extinguished luminary of Freedom, relighted for this occasion only, to preside.
The nomination was received with faint applause, started by Capt. RYNDERS, whose efforts in behalf of Freedom have made bin famous. The PRESIDENT was commendably brief and praiseworthily inaudible in his remarks.
EDWARD C. McCONNELL. (whose demonstration in behalf of freedom at the late resident of Miss Ridgeley in Duane street secured for him the attention of the Grand Jury) read a list of Vice-Presidents and Secretaries, which be put in nomination.
The PRESIDENT then announced that the Hon. A. G. BROWN, Senator from Mississippi, would address the meeting. The Hon. Senator took the stand amid the cheers of the multitude. He said Cuba must and should be ours. The decree has gone forth, and there exists nowhere power on earth to revoke it. (Cheers.) The question was how? There were three ways of getting her; was by purchase; that was the most honorable. Second by conquest; that was the most certain; and, third by fillibustering, which was the most probable If Spain would sell out that piece of real estate, would give two hundred millions of dollars. If she would
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
The United States Constitution is 'a convenant with death, and an agreement with hell.'
'The free States are the guardians and essential supports of slavery. We are the jailers and constables of the institution. There is some excuse for communities, when under a generous impulse, they espouse the cause of the oppressed in other States, and by force restore their rights; but they are without excuse in aiding other States in binding on men on unrighteous yoke. On this subject, OUR FATHERS, IN FRAMING THE CONSTITUTION, SWERVED FROM THE RIGHT. We their children, at the end of half a century, see the path of duty more clearly than they, and must walk in it. To this point the public mind has long been tending, and the time has come for looking at it fully, dispassionately, and with manly and Christian resolution. No blessing of the Union can be a compensation for taking part in the enslaving of our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to be perpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that it can only continue through our participation in wrong doing. To this conviction the free states are tending.'

not sell, he would propose to enter into negotiations which would give indemnity for the past and security for the future from the aggressive character of Spain against this free and enlightened Republic. But if this could not be done, he would abrogate the neutrality laws, and say to the filibusters, take her, and let slip the dogs of war. We wanted territorial expansion. No pent up Utica should contract was our powers, for the whole boundless continent was ours. (Tremendous cheers.) We had thus got Texas, and California. This was a great and glorious country. Mr. Jefferson was of this opinion when be bought Louisiana, and at what was regarded as an extravagant price for real estate at that time. Yet, who among the free and god-like citizens now assembled in Tammany Hall would give up one foot of that sacred soil? (Loud cheers.) That great man, James R. Polk (cheers), had secured Texas, and had secured California, with its gold. Then why should we not take Cuba? We wanted more territory. We wanted sugar. We wanted Cuba for her agricultural resources. And he wanted it for a little reason of his own�for the expansion of Slavery. (Applause.) Let Greeley understand it; let Garrison understand it; let all the bloody Abolition crew understand it. (Loud applause.) They said that England and France would object�the d�I they did! (Lood applause.) If England and France wanted to go to war about it, let them, and be d��d! (Greatapplause.) Suppose those governments should go on stilts, it we don�t bring them down, d�n me! (Renewed cheering and laughter.) What is it to us whether they like it or not? when England, the bloody old bruiser (applause) has gone slashing round the world, insulting everybody, fighting everybody, and plundering everybody.�
Here a pour Englishman who was drunk, and had not the fear of Tammany before his eyes, said gammon.� .Immediately arose a storm of put him out!� and the fists of the short boys extemporized an acquaintance with his physiognomy. He begged in vain; be bad committed the unpardonable sin. Only the voice of the great Rynders could restore order.
Senator Brown went on to say that in caw of a war with England and France the chances were that we should see an American General hoist the stars and stripes over the Tuilleries and the Palace of St. James. (Enthusiastic applause.) Talk about offending Spanish pride; why, Spain had already ceded territory twenty-one times in her history, and you might as well tell him that a woman who had been debauched twenty-one times would he offended at the twenty-second time. True, ladies of that class were apt to he coy at first, but that would soon wear off. If Cuba were to come to us a free territory, his anxiety to gel her, like Bob Acres� courage, would ooze out at his finger end. What was the condition of the African race in the Island of Cuba? Was it as good as in the Southern States? He appealed to Lloyd Garrison himself, to Gerrit Smith, or to descend lower, if possible, be appealed to Horace Greeley (applause), if the condition of the African raised in Cuba were not infinitely worse than in the Southern States. He believed that Slavery was of divine origin (applause); that God decreed it from the foundation of the world (great applause); that the African was destined, from his creation, to become the servant of the white man (continued applause); and his own opinion was, that every one before him would be better off if he had a nigger to wait upon him. (Loud and contained applause.)
Mr. Brown said he had spoken the sentiments of his own heart in its deepest recesses, and he believed he had spoken the sentiments of a vast majority of the democratic party; and charged the reporters, in the words of Othello:
���� nothing extenuate,
Nor set down aught in malice.�
The Hon. JOHN COCHIRANE next harangued the meeting. He was geological and rhetorical at the same time�referring to the waters of the Gulf, which had divorced Cuba�the fairest sister of America�from us, and now the time was come to get her back into our arms�which were open to embrace her. And if she didn�t want to be embraced, she must be embraced without reference to her wishes, because the time had come when she should be ours. The safety of this country depended upon gutting her; for if she remained as she was, there was no telling the calamities which would fall upon thin country and the Democratic party. The honorable gentlemen was also saccharine, and insisted that because we raised cotton and rice, and held the control of their market, we must, ex necessitate, extend the sphere of influence over sugar, and with a short supply of cotton, sugar and rice, the speaker argued that Europe would be unable to go to war. As a matter of fact, then, the taking of Cuba became a great humanitarian measure, designed to supersede the peace society. Again, if we had Cuba, the ad valorem duty being gone, we would be no longer compelled to scrimp ourselves in our tea or coffee. Having exhausted sugar, the speaker touched on tobacco, and finally struck a balance between Cuba and the United States in their commercial dealings, and showed that Cuba had a balance of trade against us of over forty millions of dollars. Leaving commerce, the sneaker became classic. He drew a parallel between Rome and Carthage and the United States and Cuba, and capped the climax by instituting a comparison between Senator Brown and Cato. The acquisition of Cuba being a foregone conclusion, the speaker�s remarks had an evident filibuster squint toward Guiana and Brazil. We must, therefore, have Cuba. The necessities of commerce demanded it, if we had to take it by right of power. Had England not bombarded Canton�had she not obliterated a third of Asia from the map of the world�had not we driven off the Aborigines? With these as his premises, the speaker could find no reason why we should not exterminate Greasers in Cuba. He was in favor of taking it by virtue of necessity or the law of nature, or by the force of power if necessary. (Cheers.) There was a time when America should have struck, and that was when the Black Warrior was seized; and had we a pilot at the helm then, Cuba would have been ours. (Cheers.) But another casus belli would arise in which a white warrior would he prominent, when the cohorts of America would descend upon the island with a sword in one hand, and a purse in the other. (Loud cheers.) He was sure that his words found a full response in, the meeting. (Applause.) In conclusion he said that the standard of Old Tammany was afloat, and its blood-red folds in the light of the morning would exhibit the word of our idolatry��Cuba!� Mr. Cochrane then retired amid loud cheers.
Captain RYNDERS said he was only going to my a few words. (A Voice��Go ahead, invincible Rynders.�) When be got started, he intended to go ahead. (Hurrah.) He would not enter into an extended argument.
A VOICE�Go ahead, invincible Rynders.
Captain RYNDERS�Now, if that fellow wants to speak, for God�s sake let him speak, and I will pay him for it. He would not enter into a long discussion, for they had had enough to satisfy any reasonable crowd. (That�s so.) But he would offer a few suggestions. Much bad been said about our country and other countries fillibustering, but he thought they had left the gist of the matter out. Mr. Cochrane had described Cuba in a most poetical manner. He had likened her unto a beautiful maid, tender and full of wishes, with her arms extended to Young America; and if he was not mistaken, Young America bad a most hearty wish to embrace Miss Cuba. (Applause and laughter.) We were willing to do this on reasonable terms�to legalize the marriage solemnity, and pay for it; but if Miss Cuba�s mother will not listen to reason in the way of purchase or legal marriage, all the way we can do is to run over were, and run away with her, and marry her anyhow (laughter), and then if her mother don�t like it, let her submit to the only argument she can, at the cannon�s mouth. (Cheers and laughter.) Mr. Brown had said that if Cuba stood in the English channel or at the mouth of, the Seine, and we should attempt to interim with England or France in their attempt to take it, they would laugh at us; but they would do more than that�they would take it themselves first; they would not haw eared about laughing at us, but would take it, and then say, �You are fools that you didn�t take it.� (Laughter.) Young America could take Cuba. Let them but repeal the Neutrality laws, and we would go there, and take it on our own hook. (Applause.) Instead of. as Mr. Cochrane said, Cuba sailing into New York bay, than would be a large portion of New York sailing into Havana bay. (Applause.) In less than ten days, the stars and strips would be floating over the Moro Castle. (Applause.) They knew that, as a public officer, he could not be a filibuster. (Laughter.) He would do his duty, but it went awfully against his feelings. (Laughter.) He agreed with Mr. Cochrane, that they wanted sugar cheaper�
<c02>
they would have it free. (Applause.) He believed in the democratic doctrine of extending the area of freedom�it would ever be their doctrine. We will have Cuba; it may not be to-morrow or next day, but we will have it, let them call it fillibustering or whatever they choose. What did England and Russia and Austria and France care about international law? When did they ever observe it? Did Russia when she wanted to take Turkey? When she divided Poland, England and France stood by. Was that fillibustering? They divided a country of as gallant, brave and noble people as ever trod the face of the globe. (Applause.) And when England butchered 22,000 souls in one day in India, the Queen offered up prayer. (Laughter.) He wondered did God listen to that prayer. (Laughter.) He guessed it never went higher than the Queen�s head. (Laughter.)
A VOICE��Go in.�
Capt. RYNDERS�If you will not talk so much, my good fellow, people won�t know you are a fool. (Laughter.) The difference between our fillibustering and that of other nations was that we had never subjugated a people. When we extended our territory, the people enjoyed the same privileges with us. (That�s so.) Have we ever despoiled land, and made slaves of the people? Never, except in the case of the nigger�and be thought that about right. (Applause and laughter.) But let England allow her conquered territories to enjoy the same privileges with herself. Look at Ireland. (Cheers.) He did not say this to tickle the Irish�he would see every one of them to the devil first. (Laughter.) There was a party in this country which decried against the government, because it endeavored to extend the area of freedom. (That�s so.) Well, that was so; but the democratic party was an open party, and not a sneaking party. (Applause.) There were men there to-night who wanted sugar free, and they would have it. (Applause.) In 1844 he had stood up for Texas and Oregon and 54:40, and people laughed at him, and said he was crazy; that Texas couldn�t reach the Rio Grande, and that Oregon was away up north in a region that the black republicans never heard of. But the democratic party had been successful with that cry, and if he lived until 1860, he would bring out his old banner, and add Cuba to it. (Applause.) There was no dodging in that day as there is in this, and we would not allow ourselves to be dodged out of Cuba now. The democratic party must triumph. God help the country when it did not triumph� there would be no extension of freedom, no liberty, no Union, but the North, and South, and West�he did not think there would be an eastern country, for they would join England�(laughter)�would be split up into miserable factions quarreling about a dead nigger. (Laughter.) That was where we were going. We were bound to have Cuba, and he told them we would have it. (Applause.) Young America has proclaimed it, and the venerable head of government at Washington has sanctioned it; and, as Jackson said, �the democratic party wills it.� He would add, to use a vulgar expression, he did not think all hell could stop it. (Applause and laughter.)
It being now after ten o�clock, a motion was made to adjourn, which was carried.�N. Y. Tribune.
Where, outside of the bottomless pit.�except in the United States�could such a depraved and desperate assembly be convened, and such satanic sentiments avowed, amidst enthusiastic plaudits, as were unblushingly proclaimed at this Tammany hall demonstration? And this is American �Democracy�!

THE SCHOOL QUESTION. 
The trouble in one of the Boston Public Schools, growing out of the practice introduced into it of reciting, as a part of the school exercises, the Ten Commandments and the Lord�s Prayer, according to the Protestant version, though a large part of the pupils are Catholics, is a very instructive case. No doubt it appeared to the Boston School Committee and to the teachers of the Elliot School a great piece of absurdity, if not of mischief, on the part of the Rev. Father Wiget of St. Mary�s Church, to stir up the religious prejudices of their pupils against this part of the school exercises, and to exert his pastorial authority in forbidding them to join in these recitations. It is no part of our business to defend Father Wiget; but if the Boston School Committee consider him a firebrand, what shall be said of their wisdom or common sense in going to work to arrange matters as if on purpose to furnish him an opportunity to kindle a fire? And what is to be said of the judgment, to leave the humanity out of account, of the teacher who, by dint of corporeal punishment and repeated chastisements with a ratan, makes a religious martyr of one of his pupils, and attempts to force him, on a question of religion, to obey the schoolmaster rather than the priest?
Very possibly, the Catholic parents of these children may show more good sense than either priest. School Committee, or teachers. We hope they may. Rather than have their children obliged to leave the school, they may choose to submit to the regulations of the Committee. But why establish, and still more, why continue, after its danger is proved, a practice capable of being made the occasion of rebellion on the part of the children, and grow oppression on the part of the teachers?
It has been alleged that a portion of the Catholic clergy are hostile to our whole system of public schools. It is said that they prefer that the Catholic children should have no education at all, except they receive it at Catholic hands, duly mixed up with the peculiar tenets of that faith. If such be the case, certainly everything ought to be avoided which is calculated to inflame that feeling, or to give it an opportunity for practical effect. It is difficult to see why the Lord�s Prayer, or the Ten Commandments, however proper in a Sunday School, of which the object is to teach religion, need be introduced into our public schools, of which the primary object is to teach the children to read, write, and cipher. The Rev. Father Wiget of St. Mary�s, probably considers these chants, for it seems the Commandments and the Lord�s Prayer were chanted, not recited, as an intrusion into his particular duty of superintending the religious instruction and directing the religious devotions of the Catholic children of his parish. The Catholics who, in all our cities, furnish so large a part of the pupils at our public schools, though very anxious to have their children instructed in the ordinary branches of secular knowledge, and ready to avail themselves of our public schools for that purpose, are extremely unwilling to expose them to the chance of misinstruction on the subject of religion. The matter of religious instruction they prefer to leave to their priests. It is not enough that Catholic zealots should have a chance, as they must and will, at the best, to denounce our public schools as godless? Why give them the opportunity to substitute for this the still more damaging charge of heretical instruction and heretical practices? Why turn the Lord�s Prayer and the Ten Commandments from a source of edification into an occasion for religious wrangles, rebellion, protest and martyrdom on the part of the children, passion and rataning on the part of the teachers? Were it ever so desirable to combine in our schools religious with secular instruction, the division of religious sentiment which prevails among us makes that very difficult, if not impracticable; and with so many other sources of religious instruction open, why employ our schools for that purpose at the manifest risk of driving away a considerable part of those whom it is most desirable to retain, as the public school affords almost their only chance of obtaining the rudiments of knowledge?�New York Tribune.
A PEN AND INK PORTRAIT OF GOVERNOR SEWARD.�The following is from the Washington correspondent of the Boston Transcript:
�What man is there who can pretend to describe him? We see a short, delicately made man, with a singular looking wrinkled face and Roman nose, a head calculated to puzzle Spurzheim, covered with coarse and rather short gray hair, not very tidily brushed; bushy, gray eyebrows overhanging eyes most remarkable for their brilliancy of expression; clothed in attire neat to precision, but negligently worn. We hear him speak, and his voice is poor, evidently injured by the long and prodigal use of snuff�his delivery careless even to slouchinees,� loaning against his desk with his hands in his pockets,�his only gestures made with his head, which rolls about independently of his body,�thus deliberately, and more in the tone of conversation than of debate,�he pours out the most beautiful specimens of rhetoric, the clearest logic in language of Saxon parity, the profoundest axioms, prophecies that never fail, legal aphorisms true as the statutes, illustrations drawn from every source which literature bas reached,�all clothed in language not one word of which need ever be blotted out. He never says a foolish thing.�

The Liberator.
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
BOSTON. MARCH 25, 1859.
A NEW ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY.
The readers of the Liberator saw, last week, an account of a Convention recently assembled at Worcester, to take action in regard to slavery. This Convention was brought together not by a public Call, through the newspapers, but by a Circular, addressed to a limited number of ministers and church-members. The meeting which assembled pursuant to this invitation proceeded to organize a Society, entitled The Church Anti-Slavery Society of the United States,� and to adopt a Preamble, Declaration of Principles and Constitution, and also two series of Resolutions, all of which were published as above.
The fifty gentlemen who formed a Society with this comprehensive title can hardly be considered fair representatives of the churches of the United States. Those churches yet remain, as they were in Mr. Birney�s time, �the bulwark of slavery.� The clergymen and church-members who thus organized themselves are, therefore, a very small minority, separated from the brethren whom they are accustomed to call Christian brethren� by a very great gulf, not only of opinion but of principle. The reason why the churches of the United States have neither joined the American Anti-Slavery Society, nor formed an Anti-Slavery Society for themselves, is, plainly, because they wanted no such thing. And it is notorious that, hitherto, in every large and popular sect, a clergyman could gain the approval of his brethren and their churches far better by opposing anti-slavery than by favoring it.
The members of the new Society are not satisfied with this state of things. They wish their churched, and the churches of the country at large, to be vigorously, radically, effectively anti-slavery; and they have set a good example by publicly stating the ground they themselves occupy, in a Preamble, Declaration of Principles, and Constitution, expressed in genuine and thorough-going anti-slavery language.
But, while they seem earnestly and sincerely desirous of forming an anti-slavery character in the church, their preponderant allegiance to that body, and their earnest desire to save its credit, prompt them to represent it as already bearing that character, and to press the suggestion of this idea somewhat further than truth will warrant.
The real amount of �Church Anti-Slavery� that exists in the country is sufficiently indicated by the fact, that even the fifty who were culled from all the �evangelical� denominations, and brought together be private Circular as best fitted of all that could found in New England and New York to unite in the new movement�could not be brought to a unanimous vote in regard to �the inherent sinfulness of slaveholding.� This expression passed only �by a large majority,� while all the rest was voted unanimously. The probability is, that the addition of fifty ministers more, however nicely selected, from the States in question, would have turned the majority the other way, both upon that particular expression, and upon such other radical abolitionism as their documents contain.
Fifty is a small number, but by no means a hopeless number. Much may be done by fifty, directing their energies steadily and faithfully to one object. Fifty, trusting in the Lord, and working with Him, can do wonders. But the case will be very different if they trust partly in the Lord, and partly in Egypt or Assyria. The �Church Anti-Slavery Society� appear to have fallen into this error. For, besides the weakness of affirming, among their �Principles,� that �The Church and the Ministry [are] to form the conscience of the nation in respect to slavery, and to make it loyal to the Higher Law��while the fact notoriously is, that these bodies lead in the opposite direction�the course of policy indicated in their �Resolutions,� subsequently adopted, is self-contradictor and suicidal.
The closing resolution of their last series affirms the important (though little acknowledged) truth that those who place the evil of slavery in its abuses, and not in the relation, virtually sanction the slave code and the slave system. Yet the Society have instructed their Executive Committee to confer, in regard to the publication of anti-slavery tracts, with a Society which has just publicly planted itself upon this very ground, (of opposing the evils of slavery, but not slavery itself,) namely, the American Tract Society at Boston, auxiliary to the American Tract Society at New York.
The Church Anti-Slavery Society� have also energetically expressed, in the sixth resolution of their last series, their condemnation of that persecution and proscription of the free people of color which deprive them of a portion of their rights, at the North as well as at the South. Yet the government of that Tract Society at Boston, with whom their Executive Committee are instructed to confer as anti-slavery allies, includes the pastors of two churches which have been and are eminently conspicuous in enforcing the system of caste in question: namely, Park street church, which plundered a respectable colored man of his property, forcibly expelling him, first by the action of the church committee, and next by vote of the church itself, from the pew which he had bought and paid for; and the Baptist church in Bedford street, who have voted to sell their pews to no one but a �respectable white person�; and yet the Rev. Baron Stow, and the Rev. Andrew L. Stone, who have never in the slightest degree opposed these well known characteristics of their respective churches, are adopted as coadjutors and advisers by the �Church Anti-Slavery Society.�
The new Association formed at Worcester should have been warned of the time-serving character of the Tract Society at Boston, not only by their adoption of such men as these for officers, and their deliberate re-affirmation of the resolutions of the pro-slavery New York Society as a constitutional basis but by the character of the tracts on slavery (only three in number) which they have hitherto published: the first of these being so non-committal as not to mention slavery by name, the second so profligate as to assume its perfect justice and rectitude, and the third so feeble in its condemnation as to suggest only an ultimate and very gradual emancipation of the slaves.
The �Church Anti-Slavery Society of the United States� have thus, unfortunately, shown an inconsistent character and a compromising policy in their very commencement. We seriously warn them of the danger of forming alliance with people of essentially diverse principles, and the folly of expecting practical aid from such. If they will be true to the excellent and truly anti-slavery statements of their constitutional basis, they will work with truth and righteousness, and will surely attain a measure of success. If they fritter away, by compromise, the truths which are now displayed on their banner, and which markedly distinguish them from ninety-nine hundredths of the ministers and churches in the land, their enterprise will soon sink into the oblivion which has swallowed an earlier �Clerical Appeal.��C.

TRIBUTE TO A GOOD MAN. 
DEAR MR. GARRISON
The many friends of the late ASA CUTLER, formerly of Oxford in this State, but for a number of years past resident in Putnam, Connecticut, will, I am sure, desire to know more of the circumstances of his departure than could be obtained from the brief paragraph which recently announced his death. That event had brought, to those of his friends not resident in his immediate neighborhood, no premonition of its approach; for though he had, attained a good age, yet he could not be called an old man, for ho was active and vigorous, in both mind and body, and appeared to be one of those whose strong natural constitution and well-balanced powers gave promise of a long and green old age. To this very activity and energy of will, it may be, that his seemingly premature death is to be attributed. About three weeks before his death, and when he had previously bean in his usual good health, an attack of rheumatism confined him to the house for a few days, He did not sufficiently spare himself, but went out too soon, and re-engaged in business. Another attack of rheumatism followed of a more inflammatory character, and this time appears ed in his head. By the use of powerful remedies, relief was obtained, and it was supposed that the malady had left him. One week before his death, he arose in the morning, feeling himself well, and bathed his head, neck, &c., freely in cold water. In about an hour after, he was seized with chills, the rheumatism re-appeared, and the next day had seated itself upon the heart, and all efforts for relief were unavailing. His last days were days of great suffering. At the funeral, a very great crowd was present, in the streets and at the church, earnest to manifest their respect for a thoroughly honest and a truly benevolent man.
ASA CUTLER was one of the earliest Abolitionists of New England, espousing the cause in the days of its darkness and peril, and never wavering in his attachments to it, nor in his labors in its behalf, to the very close of his life. Wherever he lived, there was an anti-slavery centre, and one from which light, as well as warmth, radiated. For be was one of the most intelligent and discriminating of men, and did not a little, wherever he was known, to open the eyes of men to see men and things as they are, and to inspire courage to resist the hypocrisies, shams, and falsehoods of the ecclesiastical and political institutions which depress and enslave so many minds. He was an upright and a just man,�true to his own convictions and fearless in declaring them; .fair in his judgment of others, willing to wait for the necessary growth of principles in the community about him and never losing hope or faith in the sure triumph of the right. He was a good man, of a large and generous heart. No one (it has been said of him) �could ask a favor of him, were they ever so poor and friendless, but he was ready to respond�,�the fact of their friendlessness indeed would be to him a reason for responding. The early agents and lecturers in the Anti-slavery field will, one and all, testify to the great value of the help he gave them, by his moral support and his liberal pecuniary aid. The Anti-slavery cause, in his death, has lost a very faithful and intelligent friend, whose loss it will be hard to supply And we who remain will be wanting in duty to that cause, if the memory of one, who was so true to it to the end, does not animate us to now and persevering efforts in its behalf. S. M. Jr. 

PHILANTHROPY IN MISSOURI.
ST. Louts, March 13, 1859. 	The present Legislature of Missouri will long be remembered for their piety, their patriotism, their sagacity, and their unselfish benevolence. A bill has been introduced into the lower House, by Mr. Jones of Marion, and passed through that body, by a vote of 88 to 29, the object of which is, to give the people of this State the practical benefit of the Dred Scott decision, which has hitherto been withheld from us so far as free negroes and mulattoes are concerned This decision, it will be remembered, declares that �black men have no rights which white men are bound to respect.� By black men, persons tinctured wish African blood are meant, no matter how white they may be. The Jones bill is to enable us to reapthe benefit of the Dred Scott decision, by selling the free blacks and mulattoes for the use of common schools, and to confiscate their real and personal property and cash, for the benefit of the poor and needy It is entitled �An Act forbidding the emancipation of slaves in Missouri; and also in relation to free negroes and mulattoes.� The first and second sections forbid the emancipation of any slave, under the penalty of $100 to $500, or imprisonment, three to six months.
Sections 3 and 12 are as follows:�
�See. 3. Every free negro or mulatto over the age of eighteen years, and under the age of fifty-five years, who shall be a resident of this State, on and after the first Monday in June, 1860, shall be reduced to slavery.�
�See. 12. The sheriff of any county in this State in which any free negro or mulatto shall be sold under: this act, shall take possession of all property, real or personal, (wearing apparel and bedding excepted, belonging to said free negro or mulatto, and after giving due notice thereof, shall expose the same to sale at public auction, at the front door of the court house, to the highest bidder for cash.�
The price of the negro sold is, by section 7, appropriated to common schools. 
The avails of his real and personal property are, by section 13, appropriated for the support of paupers The other twenty sections breathe the same magnanimous, catholic spirit of enlightened justice that is evinced in the third and twelfth sections
I am sorry to say this bill, having passed the lower House, has gone over to the fall session, when I fear some malign influences will cause its defeat in the Senate, a calamity truly fearful to contemplate. There are 2600 free negroes in this county alone. Of these 2000 or more are between eighteen and fifty-five years, and they will bring, at the east door of the courthouse, over $800 a-piece, or one million six hundred thousand dollars, the interest of which will be annually one hundred and sixty thousand dollars; enough to pay all the school teachers in the county. Truly this is a most moral and religious undertaking. I know of one negro, who belongs to the Baptist Church, who paid $500 for his wife, and $1000 for himself, and $2000 for his wife�s sister and her three small children. They will now sell at the negro auction, at the east door of our court-house, for $5000 This same negro has a good house and lot in which he lives, and he has other houses, the yearly rents of which an $700. The fee of his real estate is worth $20,000. It is not too much to say, that the property of our negroes in this county is worth $800,000 the interest of which will maintain all the poor in our county. I would like to know when, or where, you of the free States have ever made such sacrifices, in the cause of education, or of the poor? Have we not cause to be proud of our State, and of her institutions? I cannot express the feeling with which I shall greet the commendatory notice that the New York Observer and the Journal of Commerce will so heartily bestow on our unselfish legislation. Verily, the Lord moveth the hearts of men, and his ways are ways of righteousness. Amen. So mote it be. L.

ATTUCKS COMMEMORATION.
The 5th of March occurring, this year on Saturday, the commemoration was postponed to Monday evening, 7th, and came off at Chapman Hall, as announced
In the rear of the Speaker�s desk was displayed the representation of Crispus Attucks in the scene on King (State) street, March 5th, 1770.
The flag presented by Gov. Hancock to the colored military company, after the revolutionary war, and the original certificate of General Washington. Honorably discharging a colored soldier from the Connection-cur cut regiment, were displayed in the same conspicuous manner.
After martial music by the band, Wm. C. Nell introduced the exercises by bidding the friends welcome to the eighty-ninth anniversary of the scene in Boston, March 5th, 1770, remarking in substance as follows:
It will be remembered, that at the Faneuil Hall commemoration last year, our esteemed friend, Rev. Theodore Parker, playfully criticised the festive festures of the programme. Quite contrary to say thought expressed by Mr. Parker, that had been seized upon this year by those who wanted an excuse for staying away themselves, or influencing others in doing so. In reference to which, it is perhaps appropriate here to mention, the 5th of March was formerly celebrated in Boston only by a public oration. In 1783, it was resolved to cease its distinct commemoration, and observe instead the 4th of July.
The Dred Scott Decision, and other persecutions of colored Americana, previous and subsequent, has suggested the revival of the 5th of March celebration as the application of that sentiment in the Constitution of Massachusetts which declares that �a frequent recurrence to its fundamental principles is absolutely necessary to preserve the advantages of liberty, and to maintain a free government� And, as speeches comprise one department of the evening's arrangement, and socialities the other, I conceive it a legitimate blending of the two ideas.
Crispus Attucks and his companions fell on the 5th of March, 1770. ���Harrington, ��parker and others at Lexington, April 19th, 1775, and General Warren and fellow-patriots at Bunker Hill, June 17th, same year; and. as these two last named days are occasions for festivities, both social and public, lie, is there not a manifest appropriateness now in the proposed varied exercises commemorative of the event which gave birth to them both- the day which History has selected as the dawn of the American Revolution; and bat for the signal leadership of Crispus Attucks, on that day, no one ii competent to say there would have been made that Declaration of Independence dependence which has imparted such a lustre to the 4th of July.
Judge Taney, of the U. S. Supreme Court, in his Dred Scott Decision, declares that �colored men have no rights which white men are bound to respect�; and Senator Douglas, in his campaign speeches last fall, says that �this country was founded upon a white basis�; and from his seat in the Senate, recently, expresses his abhorrence of acknowledging the citizenship of zenship of colored Americans. While these atrocious sentiments are responded to by their numerous satellites all over the Union, it seems to me an imperative duty it impressed upon us to render this annual commemoration a permanent institution until at least such decisions are reversed�such sentiments expurgated gated from the theory and practice of the Judiciary and the people; and, meanwhile, colored Americans should be daily struggling for excellence in the various pursuits of life, thus offsetting the aspersions of their enemies; and, by the blessing of God, the peal of Jubilee may soon salute their ears.
After explaining the cause of absence of some speakers�
Rev. J. B. Smith of New Bedford was introduced, who, after alluding to the associations of the occasion, mentioned the book� �Colored Patriots of the American Revolution'�which, he regretted to say, had not yet received that patronage from the colored people themselves which the subject and its merits deserved.
The Trimount Club substituted for
�Oh, who would leave his native land?
one of their trios, which was sung to great acceptance.
William Lloyd Garrison next addressed the meeting, with special reference to the encouraging signs of the times in regard to the anti-slavery cause, and the condition of the free colored population.
Samuel May, Jr., spoke with particular reference to the duty devolving upon colored American to be active in promoting the Anti-Slavery cause: and called their attention to the petition now before the Legislature, in which their right, as citizens of the United States, and also of those who were liable to be claimed as fugitives, were concerned.
The Attucks Glee Club then sang to full band accompaniment, Miss Charlotte I.. Forten�s parody on Red, White, and Blue.
Charles L. Remond briefly summed up the incentives to action constantly being presented to the colored men and women of the country; and while he rebuked the lukewarmness of some, he justly commended those who were laboring to usher in the �good time coming.�
These proceedings over, the company repaired to the upper hall for refreshments; after which, a large number remained, and participated in promenading and dancing�all present during the evening expressing themselves well satisfied with the success of the commemoration.
THE PERSONAL LIBERTY BILL VS SLAVE. HUNTING. In another column we give a list of the various petitions that have been forwarded to the Legislature, at its present session, asking for a prohibition of all Slave-hunting in this Commonwealth�the number of signatures to these being nearly SEVENTEEN THOUSAND. Unquestionably. to these being nearly SEVENTEEN THOUSAND people of Massachusetts, whose names could have been readily obtained to the petition, if it had been presented to them with the same promptness in every town that it was in such places as Danvers, Georgetown, Hubbardston, Leominster, Milford, Naticle, Abington, &c. No action has yet been taken upon the reports, with amendments, from the Committee on Federal Relations, to whom the subject was referred; but the member, of the Legislature are admonished not to delay action, for the eyes of THE PEOPLE are upon them, and any other than a favorable response to their petition will lead to an agitation that will throw every other question into the shade for the ensuing year. In the House of Representatives, last week, the following substitute for the bill proposed by the Committee was introduced by Mr. J. Q. A. Griffis, of Maiden, which remain, to be acted upon
Sect. 1. No person now in the Commonwealth, or who may hereafter come, or be brought into it, shall be held, or considered, or adjudged, or treated, or delivered up, or sent out of the Commonwealth as a slave, or as a person owing service or labor to any other person, by any existing law of the United States or of this Commonwealth. 
Sect 2. Whoever. Shall arrest, imprison, or carry out of this Commonwealth or shall attempt to arrest, imprison, or carry out of this Commonwealth, under or by virtue of an act of Congress, approved the 12th of February. 1793. entitled �An Act Respecting Fugitives from Justice and Persons Escaping from the Service of their Masters,� or under or by virtue of in act of Congress, approved Sept. 18, 1850, entitled �An Act to Amend and Supplementary to an Act Respecting alleged reason that such person owes service or labor as a slave to any person, shall be punished by imprisonment in the State Prison for a term not less than three nor man more than twenty years.
See. 3. Whoever shall arrest, imprison or carry out of this Commonwealth, or shall attempt to arrest, imprison, or carry out of this Commonwealth, either without law or under or by virtue of any law now

existing, other than the acts of Congress referred to in the preceding section, any person, for the alleged reason such person owes service to or labor as a slave to any party, shall be punished by imprisonment in the State Prison for the term of his natural life, or any term of years not less than ten.

MEETING IN NEW BEDFORD.
Sears's Hall, in New Bedford, was crowded on Saturday evening, Feb. 12, with citizens who assembled under a call to investigate the claims of the African Civilization Society. The meeting was called to order by E. R. Johnson, and Henry Johnson was chosen President; Leven Betts, Wm. Bush, Wm. Berry, Rev. H. J. Johnson, Rev. James Cook, Dr. Thomas Bayne, Wm. Brown and John Goings, Vice Presidents; Bela C. Perry and Richard C. Johnson, Secretaries.
A Committee on Business was appointed, consisting of E. R. Johnson, Charles H. Brook and John Jennifer, who reported the following resolutions:-
Resolved, That we deeply sympathize with the Mission to Yoruba; but most emphatically decline to give our influence or means towards a movement which we believe is fraught with more injury to our race than years of labor can bestow upon us; and while we would not discourage those who are engaged in the cause of Missions in spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ among those semi-barbarians, we most solemnly protest against the removal of our best citizens from United States to Africa, or any foreign country.
Resolved, That, in the language of Dr. J. B. Smith, while we deeply sympathize with the infant Republic of Liberia in her noble struggle to elevate herself to an honorable and distinguished nationally, we believe the American Colonization Society to be the unrelenting foe of the colored people of this country: whatever may be the garb it assumes, or under whatever specious pretext it presents itself, it is the same malignant enemy of the colored man, having the same malicious object in view, viz.: the expatriation of the free colored people, that the slave may be rendered more secure in his chains.
Resolved, That (to quote the language of Mr. Smith) we have more faith in, nor sympathy for, the American Colonization Society, its agents or abettors, now, than we had when its iniquitous designs were more boldly and definitely stated.
Resolved, That, notwithstanding the position now occupied by Dr. J. B. Smith, we feel called upon to enter our solemn protest against the sentiments expressed in favor of our emigration, believing the premises he assumes to be untenably, illiberal, unjust, and only sustained by that selfish judgment which measures men by the amount of interest which they expect to derive for the advocacy of this visionary scheme.
The resolutions elicited an animated and protracted discussion. Speeches were made by the President, E. R. Johnson, Andrew Robeson, Dr. J. B. Smith, Wm. Berry, J. W. A. Smith, Dr. Bayne, and Alfred Swan; when, on motion of Wm. Barry, they were adopted.
Voted, That the proceedings of this meeting be published in the papers of this city, the Liberator, and Frederick Douglass's Paper.

REV. A. T. FOSS IN ILLINOIS.
ELMWOON, (Peoria Country, III.,) Feb. 23, 1859.
Dear Mr. May:
Perhaps you may be pleased to hear some particulars of the advent of Garrisonian Abolitionism in Central Illinois.
It: accordance with our desire, expressed in a letter to the Liberator two years ago, our hearty and welltried anti-slavery friend, A. T. Foss, has been down here with his 'breaking-up plow,' and the result of his labors, thus far, has more than met our expectations. Mr. Foss spoke five times; once, (we could get the place but once,) in the Congregational Church, and four times, three of which were on Sunday, in the Good Templar's Hall.
The meetings were well attended, and the vigorous and telling addresses of Mr. Foss were listened to with intense interest, but more especially the last of the series, which was on Sunday evening, in which the speaker did himself honor, and rendered valuable service to the cause we love, in showing up the rottenness and practical infidelity of the religious organizations of the land, when tried by the great test question of the day. There was, in consequence, a good deal of squirming among the earth-worms, and a pitiful squeaking among the moles, whose works were suddenly turned up to the light of day, in this plowing process. Some were shocked, to be sure, to see the venerated dry bones of popular theology pitched into one common grave, without a sigh or a parting benediction; but to many, who had long been feeding on the husks of past issues, it was indeed a refreshing change of diet, to drink in the living truths of this anti-slavery gospel, uttered by a man who has pluck enough to stand squarely on his feet, and say his soul it his own.
Some pious individuals entered at once and with alacrity into the congenial business of circulating his coadjutors, which concerning Mr. Garrison and hand, ready made, for anti-slavery emergencies: and an anonymous letter, (written, I have reason to believe, by a Methodist preacher,) threatened Mr. Foss with an application of the time-honored egg argument, (all, I suppose, 'for the glory of God!') but a good impression has been made, and cannot be erased.
Owing to the almost bottomless condition of the roads,-mud, mud, mud,-Mr. Foss will hold no more meetings in this part of the State this season. There is a broad, new field ripe for anti-slavery work in that part of Central Illinois lying west of the Illinois river, and I think, in Eastern Iowa. Can we not have a strong force in this field as early as September next, so that the work may be well advanced before the muddy season commences? We hope by that time to hear, once more, the 'cry aloud and spare not' of our portly friend, and enjoy again his genial companionship at our fireside. Yours,
E. R. BROWN.
The valuable and thorough article of our friend C. K. Whipple, published in the Liberator of March 11, presenting in full the evidence which convicts the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions of a direct complicity with slaveholders, and a direct support of slavery, as well of many equivocations and subterfuges in endeavoring to present an opposite front to a portion of their supporters, has been published in a neat tract form, by the American Anti-Slavery Society. It may be had at 138 Nassau street, New York; and at 21 Cornhill, Boston. Price, per hundred, $3; per dozen, 40 cts.; single, 5 cents. The circulation of these and other cheap tracts, recently published by the American and Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Societies, is one of the most efficient and best ways of aiding the progress and hastening the triumph of our cause.-M.
CHARLES C. BURLEIGH'S SPEECH, at the late Annual Meeting of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, is now published in a neat pamphlet form, for circulation. It is most admirably adapted to help forward the good work, which is sufficiently described in its title,-'No Slave-Hunting in the Old Bay State.' Let the edition be immediately bought, and put into circulation. It is for sale at the following low prices:-By the hundred, $3.00; dozen, 50 cts.; single, 5 cents.
To Correspondents. Has C. C. B. received a letter of March 11th, communicating a vote of the Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society? It was important, and an early answer is desired.-M.
<c02>
FREE NEGRO LEGISLATION IN MISSOURI.-The lower house of the Missouri Legislature has passed a most discreditable act relating to free negroes. We take the following synopsis of its provisions from the New York Commercial Advertiser:
'No slave shall be deemed emancipated till his master shall have entered .into bonds in the sum of two thousand dollars, to remove the negro from the state within ninety days after the act of emancipation, and if any negro who may thus have been transported from the state shall return, be shall be reduced to slavery. All free negroes who may be residents of the slate in eighteen hundred and sixty are declared to be slaves, and the sheriff is authorized to sell them under the provisions of the act. The clause is made applicable only to those persons who may have come into the state subsequent to the sixteenth of February, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, and their descendants. All free negroes of the age of eighteen are to be notified, on or before the first Monday of August next, of the existence of this act, by the sheriffs of the different counties, and twelve months is allowed in which to leave the State. Provision is made by which a free negro over twenty-one years of age may select a roaster or mistress in the state, after which he is to be regarded as a slave'.
JEFFERSON CITY, March 9.
BILL TO EXCLUDE FREE NEGROES PASSED.-The House has been engaged all day on the bill prohibiting slave emancipation, and reducing free negroes to slavery. The amendment offered by Mr. Black wood, providing that the bill should not apply to negroes who were in the State previous to February, eighteen hundred and fifty-seven, was rejected. The amendment offered by Mr. McAlister, that the bill shall not apply to St. Louis county, was also rejected.
The bill then passed, ayes eighty-eight, noes twenty-nine. The debate was very exciting.
'Old Brown,' says a correspondent of the Davenport News,' Writing from Newton, Iowa, passed through that town on the 24th ult. with twelve negroes, mules, horses and harness, en route from Missouri to Canada, On Sunday, Mr. Grinnell (a State Senator) had his negroes in church, made an appeal in their behalf, and a collection was taken up for them. The editor of the Lewisburg (Pa.) Chronicle wrote recently to Mr. Giddings, to ask if he ever said that he 'could spit upon George Washington, when he remembered that he was a slaveholder.' To which Mr. Giddings replied, as everybody, including those who invented the story, would expect him to do. He says:
'I never said, or wrote, or thought, or conceived the gross and vulgar expression which you say is attributed to me, or any thing that bears relation, likeness or similitude to it. On the contrary, I have at all times and on all occasions insisted that Washington and hi cotemporaries should be judged according to the age in which they lived, and the circumstances under which he and they were surrounded; and that slaveholders of the present day, bred and educated amid the institution, are a thousand times less guilty than Northern doughfaces, who, though bred and educated in the love of liberty, yet encourage and uphold the slave trade (in this city, and in our Territories and Southern coast) with all its attendant crime and revolting horrors.'
The N. O. Picayune laments the continual tampering with slaves. It says:
'The disappearance of one after another of valuable family servants affords evidence of the existence of an extensive organization to protect and aid those who may seek it. Free papers are manufactured, and false certificates of birth furnished, and perhaps still other means exist of interfering between masters and their servants.'
Mr. Caldwell, one of the State Senators of Virginia, and twice Mayor of Wheeling, the other day delivered at the Court House in that city a very strong speech in favor of free labor-the first speech of the kind ever delivered in that city. The audience was large, and the sensation considerable.
The Richmond Dispatch says that an intelligent gentleman of that city, recently from Cuba, says that, 'except among a few persons engaged in the American trade, the opposition there to filibusterism and annexation is universal. They have no more desire to be annexed to the United States than Louisiana has to be annexed to Spain.' 'Of all sections of this country,' adds the Dispatch, 'the South is the very last that should disturb the rights of Spain in Cuba. That island is "FORBIDDEN FRUIT" to us, and so long as it remains so, the day we eat it, we die.'
The Mayor of Columbia, S. C., at a meeting of the City Council of that city, not long since, said that he had received a communication from the Mayor of Charleston, in reply to one from himself, in which he says that 'he is satisfied that the societies for aiding underground railroads are quite rife in that city, but so cunning they cannot be caught in the act.'
A Richmond paper says, alluding to the Tributes sending a special reporter to attend the sale of Pierce Butler's slaves, that 'it is a pity the Georgians didn't know the object of his errand, and his name.' If 'tis true 'tis pity, then 'pity 'tis 'tis true.' Richard Randolph, a cousin of John Randolph of Roanoke, died in Miami Township, Ohio, on the 31st of January. The deceased, who was as eccentric as his celebrated cousin, was an old bachelor, and has resided on the Randolph Tract, Ohio, for twenty-five years. He leaves a property, mostly in land, valued at $80,000, to be expended in the purchase and freedom of the slaves now owned in the Randolph family, and those with their offspring, formerly owned by the Randolph family, which slaves are to be set free; and if the estate is not exhausted in this purchase, the balance to be applied to the use and benefit of said slaves. EMANCIPATION. Sidney B. Webb has just emigrated from Fairfax County, Virginia, to Elk Grove, Lafayette County, in this State, which he designs hereafter to make his permanent residence. He brought with him four slaves, whom he emancipated and provided for. This is an act of purely disinterested philanthropy on. the part of Mr. Webb.
THE SLAVE TRADE. A gentleman in Louisiana writes to the New London Chronicle, that several cargoes of Africans have lately been landed at various points in the Southwest. He says:
'These new chattels are filling up the whole country. Two hundred came up a little Bayou, just below me, two days ago. They are selling at seven hundred dollars. The planters who have tried the new Africans find them docile, strong, and every way much better than they had expected. The price of imported negroes is rising; but we have not heard of the fall of the price of the home-raised negro.'
THE AFRICANS. A gentleman just from Appling County, informs us that the wandering Africans are at Jacksonville, in Telfair County. They were arrested within twenty-five miles of Albany, and carried back to Jacksonville, a distance of some eighty miles. We have not yet been able to learn the real object of the captors. We presume an effort will be made by the claimants to recover them by legal process.- Savannah Republican, 11th.
THE WANDERER'S CARGO. The Edgefield (S. C.) Advertiser contains the following authoritative' 'announcement concerning the Africans brought over in the Wanderer':
'Mr. Editor,-Please insert this as an authorized announcement that the cargo of slaves, brought by the 'Wanderer' from Africa, have been landed in Edgefield District, and that most of them are now within its confines.
'This act has been done by a combination of many of the first families in Georgia and South Carolina, from purely patriotic mbtives.
'They ask for a suspension of public opinion until their motivef can be explained, and their arguments heard in defence of it. WANDERER,'
We clip the following advertisement from the Camden, Alabama, Republic, to wit:
'ONE THOUSAND AFRICANS WA.NTED. Any person wishing to contract for delivering one thousand or more Africans, at any point between Savannah, Ga., and Corpus Christi, Texas, will please address M. W. N.& Co.. Camden.
January 6th, 1859.'
MORE SLAVES LANDED AT THE SOUTH. It is rumored at Augusta, Ga., that the barque Rawlins landed 600 Africans on the coast of Florida. She cleared from Savannah on the 15th of December with a cargo of rice, ostensibly for Havana.
SUPPOSED SLAVER CAPTURED. 'A letter of the Postmaster of Apalachicola to the Albany Patriot, says the barque E. A. Rollins, taken by the steamer Vixen, on the 5th inst., in St. Joseph's Bay, had slaver equipments on board, but no papers.
A Spanish barque from the coast of Africa, with 850 negroes on board, went ashore on a reef at the east end of the island of Cuba, on the 6th ult., while attempting to effect a landing, and the captain in his despair committed suicide,
The whole number of coolies introduced into Caba thus far is upwards of 37,000. The Cubans fear their future influence, as they are much more intelligent and far leas tractable than negroes.

LEAVENWORTH, K. T., March H. Governor Medary has issued a proclamation for an election on the fourth Monday in March, in accordance with the art of the last Legislature, providing for the formation of a Constitution and State government for Kansas Three months' residence prior to the election is a requisite to vote. Aliens having declared intentions to become citizens are qualified.
OBERLIN The Oberlin Evangelist thinks it probable that before the trial of the thirty-seven rescuers is over, it will be definitely ascertained whether Ohio is a. free State or not.'
The Grand Jury of Lorain County has indicted Jennings, the Attorney for the owner of the slave John, and Messrs. Lowe, Davis and Marshall, who arrested the said John, for kidnapping. The penalty for the offence charged is imprisonment in the penitentiary for not less than three years,- Cleveland Plaindsaler.
A PROCLAMATION most GEN. TWIGGS.-The San Antonio (Texan) Herald publishes a proclamation from Gen. Twiggs, warning citizens from engaging in a reported lawless expedition to Mexico to capture runaway negroes, and then sell them, and divide the profits. The General has issued orders to the commanding officers at Forts Duncan and Clark to prevent any such attempt, and to co-operate with the Mexican authorities to that effect.
A Philadelphia correspondent of the National Era writes to that paper that Mr. Pierce Butler, a report of the sale of whose slaves we recently published, is a prominent member of the Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. 'He is,' continues the Era's correspondent,  in full communion with the "Church of the Epiphany," of which the late Rev. Dudley A. Tyng wag rector, and is very active in the Sunday-School Choir, Bible ('lasses, and other associations of this parish. Mr. Butler is likewise a vestryman, and held this office during the rectorate of the late Mr. Tyng. He voted for the expulsion of Mr. Tyng; and after the latter was ejected from the pulpit. Mr. B. had his place supplied by a clerical slaveholder from South Carolina, who became the rector.'
FREE NEGROES PRESENTED.-It will be seen by the following presentment of the Grand Jurors of this District, at the recent term of the Court of Common Pleas, that the evil of the presence of free negroes in this State has attracted their attention, and that they have taken the only means in their power to bring the subject before the Legislature of the State. We are pleased at this act of the Grand Jury, and hope other Grand Juries will follow their example, and thus impress the matter upon our law-makers until they shall be forced to abate the nuisance.
PRESENTMENT OF THE GRAND JURY, AT SPRING TERM, 1859.-We further present the tree negroes of the District as a nuisance, and recommend that the Legislature pass some law that will have the effect of relieving the community of this troublesome population.- Cheraw, S. C. Gazette.
Efforts are being made in Philadelphia to raise money to emancipate a slave named Ellen Mitchell, and her five children, now owned in Fredericksburg, Va. Some $100 have been collected thus far. This woman, as also her children, are nearly white. Her father was a white man, and her mother a quadroon. Her ease is a peculiar one. She formerly belonged to Mrs. Judge Coulter, of Fredericksburg, Virginia, in whose family she was reared as one of the household. Mrs. Coulter, in her will, decreed that her slaves should be manumitted, but the heirs, under the slave law of Virginia, succeeded in breaking the will after Mrs. Coulter's death, and, consequently, Ellen and her five children were remanded back again to slavery. DESPERATE FIGHT WITH RUNAWAY NEGROES. Two fugitive slaves were captured in Indiana, some fifty miles from Louisville, last week, and brought to the jail of that city. They escaped from a South Carolina planter some time since. They made a desperate resistance before they were secured, shooting one of the pursuers, and wounding him so badly he will hardly recover. One of the negroes was shot in the shoulder, and otherwise injured by blows.
THE SLAVE CROP OF VIRGINIA, amounts to twelve million dollars per year, sold to go to Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, &c. How many of these are raised and sold by Methodist masters? This breeding-ground of slavery for the nation is within the bounds of the Method Episcopal Church, and its chief slave-breeders are Methodists. How do their surplus slaves get into the hands of the traders, and their price into the hands of these Methodists, if they do not sell them, as the Rev. James Quin, of the Philadelphia Conference, sold his? If members of Conference sell slaves, why should not the private members Northern Independent,
MANUMISSION OF SLAVES. Mr. Robert Barnett, of Lincoln County, Kentucky, took all his slaves, eighteen in number, to Cincinnati, on the 2d inst., and gave them their freedom papers. He was offered $20,000 for them on the previous day, but rejected the offer, with the remark that he would not take $50,000, the motive influencing him being of a higher character than that of gain.
The war in Virginia between the Letcher and Goggin parties rages with increased fury The Norfolk Aryus puts in mourning a part of its sheet containing an extract from the Norfolk Herald, in which the editor said that Virginia would one day be a free State,' and the sooner the better.'
SLAVE PROPERTY PROTECTED IN NEW MEXICO.- We are proud to announce that the House of Representative of the Territorial Legislature of New Mexico yesterday passed, with but one dissenting vote, a very stringent bill, 'providing for the protection of property in slaves in this Territory,' which was sent to the Senate, where it will pass by a like very large majority.- Santa Fe Gazette, Jan. 29.

T. K. Hervey, the poet, died in England, Feb. 17, in the fifty-fifth year of his age. He was editor of the London Athenaeum from 1816 to 1854, and had previously been editor of Friendship's Offering and The Literary Souvenir. He is the author of the Convict Ship.
Judge Ingersoll, at New Haven, has decided that the evidence is not sufficient to detain the barque Laurens, seized at New London as a slaver.

NEGROES GOING SOUTH. The Weldon (N. C.) Patriot says that two thousand negroes passed through that place during the month of January, and not less than fifty thousand, it is informed, went into the cotton region during the last year.
The Warrenton Flay says that a slave boy not more than 17 years old, and about two-thirds grown, was put upon the auction block at Culpepper Court, recently, and run up to $1,224, when lie was bid in and taken down by his master, who was not willing to part with him even at that price. 
If a bill now before the Ohio Legislature passes that body, we shall have no more Ohio Congressmen elected negro votes. The bill provides that judges of elections shall reject all votes of persons of African descent, and that any such persons voting shall be punished by imprisonment. Persons advising negroes to vote are also subject to a penalty.

EFFECTS OF THE WAR RUMORS IN FRANCE. The Paris correspondent of the Manchester Guardian writes, under date of Paris, Feb. 17, that it is impossible to exaggerate the evil effects of the present uncertainty of war or peace upon the commercial and industrial development of France. Everything is at a stand-still, and ruin is sulking abroad. The provincial centers, above all, are sorely tried, and bank failures and bankruptcies of every sort are the every day events now.

LARGE FUNERAL-SUDDEN DEATH. Yesterday afternoon, the funeral of Francis A. Duterte, a colored man, well known in this city as an undertaker, took place from his late residence. South street, below Ninth, and was attended by a large concourse of his friends and acquaintances, and several lodges of. the Masonic order, to which he was attached. The funeral services took place at St. Thomas' Episcopal Church, in Filth street, corner of Adelphi, below Walnut. While the procession was passing into the church, a colored man, named Robert Ayres, fifty three years of age, residing in Lombard street, below Sixth, was attacked with a paralytic tit, and, on being taken in the vestibule, expired in a few minutes. The coroner held an inquest on the body, and a verdict was rendered in. accordance with the facts stated.
The deceased was Secretary of the church, and had been connected with it for many years. He leaves a wife and family. The interment of Mr. Duterte took place afterwards, at Lebanon Cemetery.- Philadelphia. Ledger, Thursday, March 17th. DEATH OF MIKE WALSH. This noted character in New York politics came to his death in an unknown manner in that city on Wednesday night. His body was found on the following morning, at the foot of a flight of steps in the Eighth Avenue, with his neck broken. lie had died in a fit or from the effects of a fall, while intoxicated, or from violence. One report says his watch and chain were missing. Mike was once a printer, and probably gained his first influence by the management of the Subterranean newspaper. Since he went out of Congress, he had rambled to Europe, Australia and South America, but for a few years past had lived obscurely in New York. He leaves two children. Not long ago, says the Evening Post, he lost a daughter. Of all his family, he was known to say, not one had died in his bed, and he predicted for himself a violent death, which prophecy is now fulfilled. The coroner's investigation of the circumstances attending the death of Mike Walsh leaves but little room to doubt that he was murdered for a valuable gold watch that he carried, a present to him from the late George Steers, the builder of the yacht America.

DEATH OF REV. DR. KENDALL. -The venerable James Kendall, D. D., senior pastor of the Pilgrim church at Plymouth, closed his protracted and useful life on Thursday, at the great age of eighty-nine years. He was born at Sterling in the year 1769. graduated at Cambridge in 1796, and was afterwards a tutor in the University; settled with the church in Plymouth in the year 1800, where he labored without other pastoral assistance about forty years, when he was supplied with a colleague in the person of Rev. George W. Briggs, who has since received the honorary degree of D. D., and is at present pastor of a church in Salem. Dr. Kendall preached his half-century sermon a few years ago, and has occasionally assisted in the services of the sanctuary since.

A COLORED SICKLES AND KEY AFFAIR. The Rev. D. G. Lett, pastor of the African Methodist Church in Chicago, was so intimate with the wife of Dr. Covey, who, ns well as her husband, was a member of his Church, as to excite that husband's jealousy. Last Wednesday, finding the two tete a tete in his parlor, he ran for a pistol, leveled it at his pastor's heart, and, 'with an air worthy of a policeman,' missed him-missed him at least twice. The pastor fled, but all parties were subsequently arrested. The lady's story is that the conversation was on spiritual things. The colored population are excited.
TERRIBLE RAILROAD ACCIDENT.-Albany, March 20. A terrible railroad accident happened yesterday between Flamboro and Dundas. The storm had washed away a bank and the engine ran into the chasm, nearly twenty feet deep, with a portion of the train. The locomotive, baggage car, and two passenger cars went in.
The scene is represented as more horrible than that at Desjardine's Bridge. A terrible storm was prevailing, and the water washing from the mountain, there was great difficulty in succoring the wounded or extricating the dead. The cars were a perfect mass of wreck, and the locomotive was completely buried in the soil.
The night freight train passed over the spot in safety half an hour previous to the accident.
The baggage car fell above and on to the locomotive; the first passenger car ran aslant upon this; the second passenger car slid under and upturned the end of the first; and the third running into this, had the corner carried away.

DESTRUCTIVE LAND SLIDE. A terrible avalanche occurred at Troy, N. Y., on Thursday evening, involving the almost entire destruction of a splendid structure in process of erection, known as St. Peter's College. The college was located upon a large plateau at the foot of Mt. Ida, and was to have been five stories high, and two hundred feet in length.

The accident occurring in the evening, it was not accompanied with loss of life or limb.

OUR TRADE WITH HAYTL.-The Providence Journal, in allusion to the recent revolution in Hayti, says:-
'Advantage should be taken of the new order of things to place our relations with Hayti on a footing to correspond with our trade with the Island, and to secure the greater trade that is open to us. But we suppose it cannot be done with a Democratic administration opposed to everything which recognizes the rights or the humanity of the African race.'

'He was a privileged individual in the Boston <illegible> newspaper office. He inspired respect.

His good face, his ready and approving laugh, his painful hobble, will be seen no more The icy streets, the pains of rheumatism, the fatigue of toil, are henceforth not for his worn-out body.

He was a good Shepherd; he fed his flock; his family and friends loved him without measure. As a peace-maker, he had few, if any equals. His testimony against War, Intemperance and Slavery has been constant and impressive. He was born in Charles City County, Va., where he battled with slavery with as much success as any man of his strength, until he was sixty years old. He then moved to Ohio, where he continued to sound his voice at the right time and place, until his spirit left its casement to find, (as his friends confidently hope.) a peaceful home among the angels.-[Com.

We beg leave, through this circular, to call your attention to a new work recently issued by us, and one that we are confident will occupy a high position among the many works that have been published within the last half century.
In point of interest and delineation of character we say, without fear of contradiction, that it not equalled by anything that has emarginated from the press for years.
Editors, clergymen, and literary men generally have vied with each other in bestowing upon it laudatory comments superior to those received by any work since the publication of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'
The writer shows a command of language unequalled by novel writers of the age; while, at the same time, the intense interest which Accompanies each and every page in the book is unsurpassed by any work of action.

THE OXYGENATED BITTERS.
 Nature, in her great laboratory, has stored some remedy adapted to every disease which 'flesh is heir to.' But it requires the investigation and research of the philosopher to discover and apply this remedy. Such research and investigation have succeeded in discovering a remedy for that most afflictive dispensation, the
DYSPEPSIA!
with all its lesser and numerous evils; and it may be safely asserted, that until the appearance of the Oxygenated Bitters, a case of Dyspepsia cured was a rare experience in medical practice. Now, under the influence of these Bitten, the rule is to cure, the rare exception, failure to cure.
Read the following, which the subscriber requests us to publish for the benefit of the afflicted:
An Obstinate and Inveterate Case of DYSPEPSIA Cured by the OXYGENATED BITTERS. The following, from a gentleman well known in the region in which he lives, ought to satiety all those of little faith:
WATEROWN, N. Y., July 28, 1858. 
S. W. FOWIE & Co. Boston: SIRS- Nine years since, I was attacked by that curse of all diseases, Dyspepsia, which so affected me as to cause great oppression, fulness, and bloating of the bowels immediately after eating, accompanied with terrible pains in the stomach, often occasioning nausea, vomiting. acidity, and headache, together with general debility and suffering, altogether rendering life a burden.
After having tried every known remedy without effect, and despairing of every regaining my lost health, I was induced to make use of the Oxygenated Bitters, the good effects of which were immediately visible on my health and system. Before using a whole bottle, I was entirely cured; and I feel a pleasure in inducing all like sufferers as myself to make nee of this remarkable remedy.

WHY A FATHER WAS IMPRISONED!
A father is imprisoned in Washington for harboring his own child!
TUNE- Oh no, I never mention her.
Oh, must we ever mention it?
Oh, might it be concealed!
With boiling blood, and brain on fire,
We hear the truth revealed:
The father now must spurn his child,
And say, My son, depart!
I cannot feed or shelter you,
Or press you to my heart!
You must away, unwarmed, unfed;
Nor must it e'er be known,
That you, my child, sought shelter here,
In your paternal home.
The father's heart was not of stone;
He could not turn aside,
But bade come in his much loved boy,
And placed him by his side
And warmed and fed the wandering one:
Would ye not do the same,
Ye fathers? if ye can say nay,
Then man is not your name.
A jail for this, the father's doom!
Is this a land of slaves?
The Christian name henceforth blot out,
And write, A land of knaves!
His Maker's voice has sent him forth
As lord of land and sea;
His soul was made to walk the skies
The child of Deity!
Wo to the nation that shall dare
To stifle in its breast
The voice of conscience in the soul,
Which pleads for the oppressed!
We call on all with souls not dead,
To join this moral fight;
Consider well your mission here,
And vindicate the right.
This you can dowill you be dumb
When deeds like these abound?
Your victims now for mercy call
Will you be recreant found?

PASS HIM ON.
A LAY OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD.
Pass him on! Pass him on!
Another soul from slavery won;
Another man erect to stand,
Fearless of the scourge and brand;
Another face now lifted up
Lips that drink not sorrow's cup,
Eyes no longer dimmed with tears,
Breast no longer filled with fears;
Limbs that have no galling chain
Their free motions to restrain;
Back no longer bowed and scored,
But with birthright now restored;
He that late the burden bore,
Felt the lash and pangs untold,
To be chattelized no more,
Bartered, given, bought or sold
Pass him on!
Pass him on! Pass him on
Every man who hath a son,
Every woman who hath borne
Child, and hath a heart to mourn
O'er the woes by others felt;
Every maiden who hath knelt
Down in prayer for brother dear,
Or a loved one yet more near;
Every youth who hath a friend.
With his thoughts and hopes to blend,
And desireth aye to be
Both in speech and action free;
Every one who hates the wrong,
And would vindicate the right,
Help the weak against the strong,
Aid this brother in his flight-
Pass him on!
Pass him on! Pass him on!
Ye whose sires the sword have drawn,
And with blood your freedom bought;
Ye by whom the truth is taught,
That the God who dwells on high
Sees one human family
In the races of mankind,
And would all together bind
In one unity of love,
Blissful as the life above;
Ye who speak and wield the pen,
Eloquent for rights of men,
And would proudly spurn the thought
That if you had skins less fair,
You might then be sold and bought,
And the galling fetters wear
Pass him on!
Pass him on! Pass him on!
Though his foes be legion,
Though the bloodhounds on his track
Yelling, strive to bring him back;
Though man-hunters from the South
Threat you with the pistol's mouth,
And the federative law
Would your spirits overawe:
Heed them not!imprisonment!
Take it, and be well content:
Heed them not: endure the fine,
Grow, through sacrifice, divine:
Do as you'd be done unto,
Careless of the consequence;
Keep the higher law in view;
Heed not ruffian violence
Pass him on!
Pass him on! Pass him on!
Let him lie your couch upon;
Give him raiment, give him food,
Give him kindly words and good;
Watch and guard his hours of rest,
Hide him from the searcher's quest,
Through the city wrapped in sleep,
O'er the river broad and deep;
By the farmstead, through the vale
Lighted by the moonbeams pale;
O'er the prairie wild and wide,
Where the red men still abide,
Hunters these, but not of slaves;
Far more merciful than they;
Storms and tempests, winds and waves,
Nought the fugitive must stay
Pass him on!
Pass him on! Pass him on!
Crime hath he committed none;
Would you have him grovelling lie
In the bonds of slavery?
Nobler far to rend in twain,
And throw off the yoke and chain;
Nobler far through darkness grim,
Dangers thick besetting him,
Freedom thus to seek in flight,
'Scaping from the gloom of night
Unto Freedoms glorious morn;
From the darkness to the dawn
Leapeth he o'er chasms wide;
Help him all who help him can,
God the North star for his guide
Giveth; every fellow-man
Pass him on!

THE LIBERATOR
MR. GARRISON AT MILFORD.
In accordance with previous notice, Mr. Garrison gave the people of Milford two discourses at the Brick Church, and a lecture at the Town Hall, on Sunday last., March 13th. The forenoon discourse was on the theme of Peace, and gave us a foretaste of the joy and blessedness which would follow the teachings of Christ on the Mount. It embodied also a concise and powerful argument for the doctrine of peace and goodwill to man. The afternoon service was a consideration of the worthless nature of a Christian profession as a test of true discipleship. The practicability of this subject was set home to the heart of the hearer, and a thronged house gave evidence that words so fitly spoken were not to be lost. 
But the crowning gathering was in the evening. Here the masses flocked. Our spacious hall was not sufficient to receive all, and many had to leave. After an appropriate hymn, sung with excellent effect, a brief introduction by G. W. Stacy, and pertinent selections from the Bible, read by Mr. G., the lecture on Garrisonian Infidelity commenced, and continued for the space of two hours. Although the position of many was most uncomfortable, being unable to find seats, nevertheless, a patient and attentive hearing was given.
A part of this lecture was a reply to Rev. Mr. George, a Methodist minister, of Natick. This man has suddenly popped up to revive the old warfare through which the Abolitionists passed, in days of auld lang syne. He may make a lion-and will, when his ability exceeds his meanness. He does his work in his own way, in the coward's castle. How true it is that instinct is a great matter!
The Rev. gentleman's vituperation and abuse were criticised in a strong and forcible manner, and those who heard both sides could not fail to see the unfairness and malignity of this clerical traducer. The platform was made perfectly free,-a privilege we never have in Milford among the self-styled evangelical sects and pseudo-liberalists. Good seed has been sown on our soil, and we feel to rejoice that our labor is not in vain; and the result, we are quite sure, will, be an abundant harvest.
The game, to far as this Rev. opponent is concerned, will hardly pay the shot, but a door is thus opened to save others from priestly cant and wicked hollowness. We are happy to add, that Mr. Garrison is to visit Milford again in a few weeks, to lecture on the subject of the Plenary Inspiration of the Bible. So we go. Give us agitation, a free platform, and the truth will have free course and be glorified.
Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again,
The eternal years of God are hers;
But Error, wounded, writhes in pain,
And dies amid her worshippers.
Milford,(Mass.) March 14, 1859. S

MISS HOLLEY AT PORTSMOUTH.
PORTSMOUTH, March 14, 1859.
Many of our usually conservative community have been somewhat aroused by the earnest labors of Miss Holley, in this city, the last two weeks. Her first lecture in the Temple, on the 6th inst., was received by an attentive audience, and a very favorable impression was made on the hearers. Her labors did not end with the lecture, but daily, from house to house, through the past week, she has broken the bread of Anti-Slavery to many willing souls. At one house, being coolly received and almost repulsed, she did not falter, but afterwards said to a friend, in the kindness of her large heart-O, she may yet be brought to set the truth; she has large benevolence and a kind soul, but is deceived by the false position in which the subject has always been presented before her. She too will yet come in, and be added to the household of faith.
Rev. Thomas Holmes very cordially invited Miss Holley to occupy his pulpit on last Sunday afternoon, which offer she readily accepted, and spoke, from the 12th chapter of Matthew, to one of the largest audiences that have been gathered here for a long time on a religious occasion; and, as she spoke the words of life, many a countenance bore witness to the truth, as it came from the heart, and reached the heart. The service was continued much longer than is usually allowed for Sunday worship; but most of the audience felt as if the time was well spent, and, like the inquirers when Paul preached at Athens, said, We will hear thee again on this matter.
For the Christian liberality of brother Holmes and Society, the friends of the slave in this place desire that the blessings of those that are ready to perish may rest upon him and them. It was truly a refreshing time-may we not say, a reformation time? It was as when the multitude were fed with the blessed loaves; but, as of old, as soon as the hard sayings of Jesus are heard, demanding sacrifice, how many go away, and follow no more after him! But we will be thankful for what we have heard. The camp of Israel does move forward, and we need more such laborers as Miss H. in the Anti-Slavery vineyard.
The labors of Miss Putnam have done much good, in her visits from house to house, day after day, leaving line upon line, precept upon precept, with that gentle and persevering labor peculiar to herself. It is like the bread cast upon the waters, and the promises yet remain good to those who sow in tears; they shall return rejoicing, bearing their sheaves with them.
The loss of the staying hands of our departed friend James Nowell is keenly felt in our small ranks, but the influence of his life remains with us as a blessed legacy, which will be felt ages to come. May we not say it, will never die? His house and heart were always open to the fugitive, who, as he fled to Freedom's land, did not pass by, but went through its door with renewed strength and courage. But he has gone to that rest which remaineth. To all such it is said, Inasmuch as ye have done it to the least of these, ye have done it unto me.
A FRIEND OF FREEDOM.

LETTER FROM J. A. HOWLAND.
FRIEND MAY:
I can heartily sympathize with Mr. Foss in his tribulation with Western mud. Perhaps Illinois mud exceeds that of Ohio in intensity of slimy nastiness; but I have found that of Ohio to exceed any thing of the kind that I ever before experienced. And then, to have it all winter, when we should have snow, as we hear you have at the East, is almost unendurable.
Yet, in spite of rain and mud, which have continued almost without interruption hitherto, I have had a very favorable campaign, so far as finding abundance of people ready and willing to hear; and I have held, both alone and in conjunction with B. S. Jones, who was with me most of the time for ten weeks, all the meetings that I had time or strength for. Sometimes we found indifference and apathy, and at a few places, violent opposition and mobocratic violence on the part of a few fellows of the baser sort, that seemed to endanger the continuance of the meeting assailed, and occasionally, when stones and clubs were thrown, our own personal safety. Yet none of our meetings have been broken up, and though hit with their dangerous missiles, we have hitherto escaped unhurt. But, for the most part, we have had interested and attentive audiences, and in many places there has been quite an interest to hear and know what strange things these men set forth. In Deersville, Harrison County, we held four meetings, each of us speaking from one to two hours at each meeting, and still the packed audiences sat intently listening to the interminable and prolonged addresses, occasionally interrupting with, questions or objections urged for the most part in a candid spirit; and it cannot but be

<c03>
hoped that this exposition of truth in that place will 
be productive of much good.
In Harrisville, Harrison county, six meetings were held. At four of them, friend Jones was with me, and two I held alone. The house was crowded on 
each evening, and the audience was quiet and attentive to the close of the protracted sessions. Some light opposition was manifested at the outset, one old Quaker affirming that we ought to be egged out of town; and a Methodist class-leader, who disturbed one or two of the meetings with his passionate and ignorant denial of our propositions, told us in meeting that we deserved to be egged; and yet he had, that very evening, read us an essay from a Quaker paper upon the necessity and duty of peaceful and Christian applications to the evil of slavery. To the principles of the essay we assented, but could not accept either the Quaker's or the Methodist's practical application of eggs as a proper exemplification thereof. But the mass of the people desired to hear, and maintained a quiet respect for themselves and for us, and the manner of treating the subjects in hand.
Though we do not know of making any individual converts, yet we feel that the public mind is impressed with our principles; and though not prepared to accept them very much in individual and isolated cases, yet there is going on a gradual and general indoctrination of our principles, that will prepare the masses for correct action when some crisis or convulsion occurs, or some initiative step is taken that leads in the right direction. We find, wherever we go, that the people are discussing the disunion question upon the notice of, during the course of, and long after our meetings, in stores, public places, and in private. In many places, it has formed a prominent topic of discussion in the village and school-district lyceums, without reference to our meetings. At one place, the lyceum were discussing the proposition that the government of the United States is the blackest despotism that exists on the earth,  and, strange to say, only one person was willing, in a full meeting, to take the negative, and he only for the purpose of sustaining the argument, against his convictions.
The anti-kidnapping petition we have circulated extensively, and with good success. Many names are readily obtained, and more would be, were it not for political influences. The universal feeling of the people is with it, but they fear the charge of political inconsistency. We find that the more prominently and actively men are devoted to Republicanism, the more unwilling are they to sign the petition. They acknowledge its righteousness, but dare not commit themselves to the act.
But this movement meets a hearty response in the great heart of the people, and will be crystalized into statutes in most if not all the free States, before many years pass over us. Indeed, I almost hope, from the appearances as I read them, that Massachusetts will make kidnapping illegal in the old Bay State, at the present session of its Legislature.
While travelling with Mr. Jones, we had between us a small horse and saddle, which, with saddle-bags, and valise behind and carpet-bag before the rider, carried one of us, with tracts and baggage, while the other walked, at which we took turns; and so we were quite independent of such things as railroads and stages, which are very convenient when they run in the right direction at the right time; but as they failed to accommodate us in this particular, we deserted them, and took to our saddle and feet, and so were independent of all the ordinary vehicular expediencies.
Horseback riding is a very common and convenient mode of travel here, where the roads are almost impassable at this season, and I have become quite a proficient equestrian. I used, when a boy, to ride the horses to water, without saddle or bridle, and also ride the horse to plough, but never, probably, rode ten miles in a saddle till I came to Ohio. But here, I have ridden more than two hundred miles on horseback the past winter, and walked as much more; mostly in short stages, however, and have had some curious as well as trying experience, through such mud as I can do no manner of justice to by attempted description. But my proficiency in horsemanship is not at all of the ornamental kind, but only of the practical and useful parts; and I should not, without more experience, feel like entering as a contestant for the equestrian prize at any of our Massachusetts Agricultural Fairs.
Spring seems to have arrived in good earnest. Farmers have been ploughing since the middle of February, and gardeners are preparing their hot as well as open beds, and sowing early seeds and transplanting trees. The ground has not been, frozen for more than three weeks, and the robin, bluebird, and other spring birds, are carolling merrily in joyous testimony of the return of spring. Indeed, it has hardly been winter at all here(opposite Wheeling, Va.) The thermometer has not once reached zero! Not much like your 25 and 30 degs. Below zero. J. A. H.

LETTER FROM ANDREW T. FOSS.
FREMONT, (Steuben Co., Ill.,)
March 7, 1859.
DEAR FRIEND MAY:
My last communication left me in Joe Davicss Co., where all my meetings were successful; the two last(not reported in a former communication) quite as much so as any of the former ones.
From there I came on to Clinton,(Iowa,) to which place I had been invited to come by C. B. Campbell-of whom I have spoken in a former communication. He had removed from Unionville, Illinois. He and his excellent wife showed me every kindness, and aided me much in getting a hearing before the people.
My first meetings were holden in Fulton, on the Illinois side of the river. This is a poor rundown, proud, bigoted place, with a few really excellent people in it; I am sure not enough to save it from pecuniary destruction, and I fear that all hope of moral salvation is groundless.
My first meeting was on Sunday, at 3 o'clock, P. M. We chose this hour because it was not occupied by the various sects. When 3 o'clock came, we found three or four persons in the house. At half-past 3, about six had arrived. At 4, there were about thirty persons present. I now commenced speaking, and the sound of my voice brought in a few more, who were passing by. At the close of my remarks, a member of the M. E. Church arose, and very kindly offered me the use of the Methodist church, and said he would do what he could to get me a good hearing. I, of course, gratefully accepted the offer. The meeting was appointed for Tuesday evening. Well, on Tuesday evening, friend Campbell and myself crossed over to the meeting.
The house was well lighted and warm, and well filled with people. I spoke upon Disunion as the Christian and only method of removing slavery from the land. When I had closed, a man arose, and said he was a Massachusetts man, and arose there to vindicate Massachusetts from the vile aspersions that had been cast upon her that evening. He said, the statement that colored schools in Massachusetts had been abolished was false. Also that there was no prejudice against colored persons in Boston-that a white man would not dare walk in the streets of Boston with a colored woman, or a man of color with a white lady-that I had libelled Massachusetts, &c A lady immediately arose, and said she was from Massachusetts also, and knew that every word I had said was true. She spoke for some minutes with great earnestness, and was heartily responded to by the audience.
I stated that I had not said there was no prejudice against color in Boston. I was mortified and pained to say, that there was in the churches, and in Boston society generally, a very wicked prejudice against our colored brethen. Still, all I had stated in regard to

<c04>
the schools of Massachusetts was true; but it was true, too, that this prejudice was fast melting away before the increasing intelligence and moral cultivation of the people-that so far as it regarded walking in the streets of Boston with colored ladies, I had done that same thing frequently, and expected to do so again-that I had witnessed that same thing so often, that I should not expect it to excite any special notice, except with a few low people, who have not yet emigrated to the West, and of whom it might be said that what Massachusetts gained in their departure, Illinois lost in their arrival. So far as I could judge, the effect of the meeting was good. Dr. Benton and his excellent lady gave me the hospitalities of their home for the night.
My next meeting, on the following evening, was in Lyons, exactly opposite to Fulton. There is a little more life in this city. I had, two years ago, in company with Mrs. Colman, spoken in this city. We at that time obtained a good hearing by the kindness of a Universalist minister, who gave up his regular appointment to us. His stated congregation, with what the bills brought in, made us a large congregation. But now the good man was gone, and I had nothing but the prestige of our good cause on which to rely. Besides, the evening was quite stormy; the result of all which was, the meeting was small. I ought to mention, too, that great efforts were making to revive the waning life of a man-hating religion. The devotees had neither time nor heart to think of the poor slave, or to attempt at all his deliverance.
My next point was at De Witt, in Clinton county. Friend Campbell had written to Judge Graham, who had returned an answer, saying, Come on
I found, on my arrival, my bills posted, and every arrangement for the meeting perfectly made. I have held three meetings, very largely attended. Judge Graham and many others gave me the heartiest God speed. The democratic editor was out of the place; consequently, we had no opposition, except a single yelp, from a very small democratic whiffit. I have heard that the editor has taken ample vengeance, in his paper, since his return. It is in my heart to say a good word for De Witt. If I should ever return to the West, there are few places I should visit with more pleasure.
My next meetings were in Clinton. I held one in the Baptist meeting-house. It was not a large meeting for numbers, but it was a good one, for the audience seemed intelligent and appreciative. I offered to speak the next evening, and enquired if the house could be had for that purpose. No answer was given. A gentleman, whose name has escaped me, said he had a hall which he would warm and light free of expense. I, of course, gratefully accepted the generous offer.
The meeting in the hall, which was very commodious and well lighted and warmed, was not much larger than the first, but still the intelligence and apparent sympathy of the audience gave me much satisfaction and hope of good. On Sunday, I spoke once more in the same hall to about the same congregation. Here ended my labors in Iowa. For their success, all credit is due to the ardent zeal, and intelligent and continued labors of Mr. and Mrs. Campbell. I hope yet to see them more publicly devoting themselves to the Anti-Slavery work, for which I am sure they are eminently qualified.
My next point was in Elmwood, in Peoria county, Illinois. Here reside our good friends, E. R. Brown and wife, formerly of Chester, Mass. Here I found, on a visit, Hiram Brown, our old ally and faithful friend, the veritable Deacon, of Cummington, Mass. Also, Wm. Dawes and wife, and a Mr. Jenkins and wife, from Massachusetts. These all, by labor and by song, and cash too, gave me efficient support. The meetings here were well attended, considering the terrible mud. Oh dear! I lost my own shoes, and came near losing myself. Oh! bury me not in the deep, deep' mud! Some how, these Illinoians know how to get through the mud. We of the far East could beat them in plunging through the drifts of snow. The Arab could beat us all in wading through his sand. There is a great deal in one's education. I will not speak especially of these meetings, as friend Brown intends to report them.
My next visit was at Waukegan, Illinois. Here I held one very successful meeting; it was on Sunday; the mud was bad, and the storm raged all day, yet we had a good audience, and I obtained seven subscribers for the Liberator.
I was quite unwell with hoarseness and sore throat. But with the friends' kindness and care, I was almost immediately better, and in a few days well. I spent a few days in Chicago with our excellent friends, J. W. and Elizabeth Loomis. I had expected to speak there, in the hall of the Spiritualists, on Sunday; but learning from friend Loomis, before I came to Chicago, that the persons who had invited me to speak had come to the conclusion that the people needed spiritual food, I sent the appointment to Waukegan.
I am to speak in Angola, Ind., on Sunday next, 6th inst. I shall be working my way on through Michigan and Ohio and Western Pennsylvania, home.
Yours, truly, A. T. FOSS.
SAMUEL MAY, Jr., General Agent.
A PROTRACTED SLAVE CASE.
ST. LOUIS, March 13, 1859.
Last week, I was in the Circuit Court when the closing arguments were made in the case of Charlotte vs. Chouteau. Charlotte sues for her freedom. This case has been sixteen years in court. Charlotte beat him at first, but the case went to the Supreme Court, which reversed and remanded the cause, because the Court decided that the law of Canada on the slave question was matter for the consideration of the Court, and not for the jury. On the second trial, Charlotte beat him, and the Supreme Court reversed the decision, because the Circuit Court decided that the law of Canada on the slave question was matter for the consideration of the jury, and not of the Court, and the case was remanded for a new trial. She beat him again, and the case was reversed and remanded, because the law of Canada on the slave question was matter for the consideration of the Court, and not of the jury. It was submitted again last week, and Charlotte has succeeded. It will go up to the Supreme Court again. Chouteau is worth one or two millions; is seventy years old, has only one child, a daughter by a slave, whom he has educated. He has a lawyer who fully sympathizes with him, and whose eyes sparkled with holy indignation as he commented upon the testimony of Chief Justice Reed of Canada, who testified to the wicked character of slavery, as he considered it.

DR. CHREVER INCHEEVEB IK PHILADELPHIA.
[Correspondence of the Anti-Slavery Standard.]
PHILADELPHIA, March 15.
DR. CHEEVERS lecture, on Tuesday evening, the 7th inst., was attended by a large audience, not-withstanding the Inclemency of the weather. It was the most thorough exposition of anti-slavery truth, in its bearing upon the Church and clergy, that I have ever had the pleasure of listening to from an Orthodox minister. Dr. Cheever is one of the few of his order who is susceptible of a high degree of indignation against a popular iniquity. The heinousness of our national sin has impressed itself deeply upon his sensibilities; filling him with a righteous wrath, and causing him to speak as with a tongue of fire.
His discourse on this occasion was the same, substantially, as that delivered a few weeks ago in Albany, Its chief topics were: The Fugitive Slave Law; the Dred Scott decision; the Church; the American Tract Society, and the American Board of Missions. The last three he touched upon incidentally; the others constituted the burden of his address.
It was Dr. Cheever's first appearance in Philadelphia. His audience was made up chiefly of Reform-

<c05>
ed Presbyterians(Covenanters) and Garrisonian Abolitionists; and it is a compliment due to the speaker to say that his lecture was listened to with the highest gratification. Dr. Cheever is not an orator, as that word is usually understood. In the graces of diction, a fastidious ear might find him somewhat lacking; but in power he has few superiors. Any one that has ever heard Beriah Green, in his best days, would be reminded of him in listening to Dr. Cheever. The same nervous, vigorous, fire-and-hammer style which characterized the one, distinguishes the other. In some respects, too, Dr. Cheever is not unlike Garrison. He has Garrisons earnestness, and a good deal of his calm dignity. He does not speak, perhaps, with the same apostolic or Hebrew-prophet-like authority as does Garrison; but he is well acquainted with the Scriptures, and quotes, like him, from them with great force and aptness.
It was a matter of regret to some of us that Dr. Cheever's audience at Concert Hall did not include more of the class whom it particularly concerned. I doubt if there was a single representative them there of the Tract Society, or Board of Missions, or young Men's Christian Association; and of Dr. Cheever's quondam clerical friends and New School sympathizers, such as Dr. Barnes and the like, I did not see one.
Although the maintenance of slavery is not one of the sins spoken against in our fashionable synagogues, we have had a good deal of ministerial demonstration against it this winter in other places. The Covenanters have borne their uncompromising testimony against it in their usual way; Dr. Furness has not let a Sunday pass without, in some way or other, washing his hands of it; and the Quakers, at least of the Hicksite branch, have been more than commonly outspoken against the enormity. Rachel Barker Moore, one of the most popular and eloquent of this division of the Society, has made it the subject of frequent appeals to large and miscellaneous audiences, and her fidelity and plainness of speech have elicited many marks of approval. Of Lucretia Mott it is not necessary that I should speak. Her labors, in season and out of season, are known to every one. She never tires. In the gallery; on the platform; in meetings for worship; in meetings for business; at Preparative meetings, Quarterly meetings, Yearly meetings; at marriages, at funerals, at social parties; at the fireside, by the wayside; everywhere and always she bears about her the wrongs of the slave, and never fails to raise her voice against the sin of his oppressors. And that her labors are not in vain, we have the most encouraging testimony. People who used to resist and speak evil of her, are now amongst the most pleased of her auditors. Without abating one jot the severity of her rebukes, or the radicalness of her doctrine, she enjoys a popularity at this time which she had never before reached. Abroad, as well as at home, she is listened to with a fervor which bespeaks, at the same time, her own fidelity and the progress of the cause. Your Washington correspondent has given us an account of her recent reception in that city. From other sources we have corroboration of his testimony.
Mrs. Mott had not visited Washington for sixteen years. When she was there then, her presence, except to a few, was most unwelcome. Now all was changed. She was cordially received by many of the most influential people, and was respectfully treated by all classes. Her meetings were attended by Southern members of Congress and other slaveholders, and what she said was listened to with all becoming deference. Senator Chesnut (of South Carolina) was observed to enter the house just as she was commencing upon the topic of the slave trade. Seward of Georgia was there, and Ex-Governor Smith of Virginia. The latter remarked that he liked her spirit, but that she did not understand the nigger question. He would like to see her, he said, and converse with her on the subject, but he took discreet care not to call. A Southern lady listened to one of the discourses with an interest so intense that she could not sit still nor keep quiet. Turning to another lady when it was over, she said It makes my blood boil; but I can't gainsay a word she has said. Senator Hale, speaking on the subject to a friend, as he passed through this city, observed that she made a splendid impression in Washington.

DEATH OF ARNOLD BUFFUM.
Died, at Eagleswood, near Perth Amboy, N., at the house of his children, Marcus and Rebecca Spring, on Sunday, March 13th, ARNOLD BUFFUM aged 77 years. Mr. Buffum was one of The Twelve who organized the New England Anti-Slavery Society (January 1.1832), of which he was the first President and the first Lecturing Agent. He had then recently returned from a visit to England, where his zeal in the anti-slavery cause had been quickened by intercourse with Clarkson, Wilberforce, Macaulay and their associates. He lectured extensively in various parts of New England, and thus did much to aid the cause in its day of small things. He was one of the delegation from Massachusetts to the Convention that met in Philadelphia, December, 1833, to organize the American Anti-Slavery Society, and his name appears among the signers of the Declaration of Sentiments then and there adopted. During the entire struggle, he has never faltered in his testimony against slavery. For some years past, he and his venerable wife have resided at Eagleswood, where, surrounded by his children and grandchildren, his life ebbed peacefully and happily away. His last hours, we learn, were hours of Christian faith and Divine illumination. He gently yielded his breath, with the assurance that he was falling into his Heavenly Father's arms, and that a glorious future was before him. The funeral services took place on Wednesday, the Rev. Dr. Bellows of this city officiating. Mr. Spring, his son-in-law, in a note addressed to us, says:
We shall miss him sadly, not only from our home, where his cheerful and loving spirit has blessed us with its presence to the very last hour of his life, but also in our little Sunday morning meeting, which he has regularly and promptly attended, and wherein he has as regularly read appropriate selections from the Scriptures.-Anti-Slavery Standard.

ANOTHER SLAVE CASE.
(Washington correspondence of the Anti-Slavery standard.)
A slave case, of a somewhat singular character, has come to my knowledge within the past week. Some years since, a slaveholder in Virginia died, and freed his slaves. The Court decided the emancipation clause of the will void, and the legatee proceeded to sell the manumitted people South. One woman among them was white, or so nearly white that she easily passes for a white woman. This woman and her large family of children were sold by the legatee to a trader in negroes, who seems to have a soft spot in his heart. The sale was at the nominal price of $1.000 for the entire family, with the verbal agreement that the friends of the woman might purchase her, at that price, of the trader, and send her to a free State. The slave woman's husband was a white man also-I call him her husband, for he ought to be, inasmuch as he is the father of her children. I have seen a letter from one of this woman's white relatives-a Virginia aristocrat, I presume-calling upon the people of the free States to buy her, and, as the case is a striking one, and the sum demanded somewhat moderate, I think she will be ransomed from bondage. The negro-trader has agreed that the woman may go North to solicit money for this purpose. Several Congressmen contributed liberally before leaving the city, and I hear that one colored man has agreed to pay a couple of hundred dollars out of his own purse to rescue the woman and her children. We see in this case, as in that of the illustrious Bob Butt, that the slaveholding aristocracy know a great deal better how to preach philanthropy than to practise it. They represent this case as a most deserving one, and they affectionately advise anti-slavery people of Washington and the North to free the woman-but as for themselves they do not give the first dollar. This is Southern generosity that we hear so much about in the newspapers and story-books, I suppose.
The trial of Mr. Sickles is still pat off, and I hear he is becoming impatient. It doubtless seems hard to a man in his position to lie in jail even for a few weeks, before trial; but let him remember the honest and guiltless men who have lain for years in that old dungeon. Good men have been shut up in that prison before now, and Mr. Sickles may as well know what such men have suffered. Everybody here expects that Mr. Sickles will be acquitted, though there are those who say that he deserves hanging. The friends of Key are much excited over the prospect of an acquittal, and profess to believe that he was the victim of a conspiracy. The Star of this city is upon the side of Key, and demands a thorough examination of the character of Sickles upon the trial,. This will he be resisted by the prisoner. The President is much interested in the case and sympathizes with Mr. Sickles, (!) who has been one of the most capable of his agents. He was

<c06>
a man after Mr. Buchanans own heart, for he was abrewd and unscrupulous. He knew how to manage the New York City politicians better than any man in the country, and he was at all times in the confidence of the President. Yet Mr. Sickles was not in reality the devoted friend of the Administration. Fora year past-and this fact shows, his artfulness Mr. Sickles, has been on good terms with Douglas, and has given Mr. D. assurances of his Political friendship and future support, yet the President has never for a moment doubted that Sickles cordially hated Douglas. The New York member has been altogether too sharp for his master. He has cheated and managed him. If you may judge a man by the company he keeps-a President by the character of his advisers and retainers-James Buchanan will not stand very high. His most intimate friends, his confidants, are such men as Dan Sickles-men of loose character, of no principle adulterers, whore mongers, murderers, and wholesale dealers in corruption. These are not exaggerated, partizan statements, but undeniable facts. James Buchanan <illegible> up for considerable of a saint, but he has patronized murder in Kansas, and the majority of his intimate friends are scoundrels, leaving slavery out of the question. What, then, may we expect from such a man and such an administration?
D. S. T.
Ayers Sarsaparilla,

A compound remedy, in which we have labored to produce the most effectual alterative that can be made. It is a concentrated extract of Para Sarsa parilla, so combined with other substances of still greater alterative power as to afford an effective antidote for the diseases Sarsaparilla is reputed to cure. It is believed that such a remedy is wanted by those who suffer from Strumous complaints, and that one which will accomplish their cure must prove of immense service to this large class of <Illegible> afflicted fellow-citizens. How completely this compound will do it has been proven by experiment on many of the worst cases to be found of the following complaints:-
SCROFULA AND SCROFULOUS COMPLAINTS,<Illegible> AND ERUPTIVE DISEASES, ULCERS, PIMPLES, BLOTCHES, TUMORS, SALT RHEUM, SCALD HEAD, SYPHILIS AND SYPHILITIC AFFECTIONS, MERCURIAL DISEASE, DROPSY, NEURALGIA OF TIC DOULOUREUX, DEBILITY, DYSPEPSIA AND INDIGESTIAN, ERYSIPELAS, ROSE OR ST. ANTHONYS FIRE, and indeed the whole class of complaints arising from IMPURITY OF THE BLOOD.
This compound will be found a great promoter of health, when taken in the spring, to expel the foul humors which fester in the blood at that season of the year. By the timely expulsion of them many rankling disorders are nipped in the bud. Multitudes can, by the aid of this remedy, spare themselves from the endurance of foul eruptions and ulcerous sores, through which the system will strive to rid itself of corruptions, if not assisted to do this through the natural channels of the body by an alterative medicine. Cleanse out the vitiated blood whenever you find its impurities bursting through the skin in pimples, eruptions, or sores; cleanse it when you find it is obstructed and sluggish in the veins; cleanse it whenever it is foul, and your feelings will tell you when. Even where no particular disorder is felt, people enjoy better health, and live longer, for cleansing the blood. Keep the blood healthy, and all is well; but with this pabulum of life disordered, there can be no lasting health. Sooner or later something must go wrong, and the great machinery of life is disordered or overthrown.
Sarsaparilla has, and deserves much, the reputation of accomplishing these ends. But the world has been egregiously deceived by preparations of it, partly because the drug alone has not all the virtue that is claimed for it, but more because many preparations, pretending to be concentrated extracts of it, contain but little of the virtue of Sarsaparilla, or any thing else.
During late years the public have been misled by large bottles, pretending to give a quart of Extract of Sarsaparilla for one dollar. Most of these have been frauds upon the sick, for they not only contain little, if any, Sarsaparilla, but often no curative properties whatever. Hence, bitter and painful disappointment has followed the use of the various extracts of Sarsaparilla which flood the<Illegible> market, until the name itself is justly despised, and has become synonymous with imposition and cheat. Still we call this compound Sarsaparilla, and intend to supply such a remedy as shall rescue the name from the load of obloquy which rests upon it. And we think we have ground for believing it hat virtues which are irresistible by the ordinary run of the diseases it is intended to cure. In order to secure their complete eradication from the system, the remedy should be judiciously taken according to directions on the bottle.

REFUGE OF OPPRESSION.

From the New York Journal of Commerce.
THE GOVERNMENT OFFICERS AND THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW SUSTAINED.
The fact has already been announced by a telegram Cleveland, Ohio, that the Supreme Court of that State, in the case of Bushnell and others, (charged by indictments, and in the case of Bushnell convicted of unlawfully obstructing the laws of the United States,) decided, by a full Court, the Judges being UNANIMOUS, to refuse the application for the writ of habeas corpus. The Cleveland National Democrat remarks thereupon as follows:
We are glad to record this fact, for it is a sign of returning reason. Bitter partisans here, under the belief that the writ would be granted as a matter of course-the belief being founded on the fact that all the Judges were of the so-called Republican party-made high threats of taking the prisoners from the hands of the Government officers. This kind of foolish boasting will now be stopped-party zeal, regardless of law, having effervesced, will now subside, and will he found, like ginger pop, after it has done working, to be but 'stale, flat and unprofitable. The decision of the Supreme Court has relieved these gentlemen of the difficulty into which their foolish boasting might have precipitated them, although it has made some of them, at least, fit subjects for ridicule for their braggadocio boastings; but this they can bear, for it is better for them obeah the ills they have, than to fly to those they know not of. Had the writ of habeas corpus been granted, from our knowledge of the Government officers in this city, and from our knowledge of the determination of President Buchanan and of the <illegible> Cabinet who surrounds him, to see that the laws of the United States are faithfully executed, we feel a freedom in saying that the law would have been left to take its course against the persons indicted, regardless of any and of all consequences. But the Supreme Court of Ohio has decided, what every right-thinking man felt should be the proper decision, that the Ohio Courts have no right to interfere with the jurisdiction of the United States Courts, in the ease of persons charged with an offence against the laws of the General Government, and in this decision, the State Court has shown itself, not, us many of the political friends of the Judges believed, a mere partisan Court, overriding the Constitution and the laws, for political purposes. but a Court of law, of right, of justice, and opposed to all lawless violence. Hence, we congratulate the country on its political friends being deceived, and on the fact that the Judges have taken their stand by the Constitution of the United States and of the State of Ohio, which they have sworn to support.
The Columbus (Ohio) Statesman says:
The Court unanimously declined to inter few, refusing to allow the writ. This is well, for had the judges been moved by the representation of healed fanatics, or the evil suggestions of unscrupulous demagogues, to override the law and interfere with the lawful jurisdiction of the United States Court and its officers, the consequences would have been fearful. Yet many of the Republicans here were mad enough to desire it. They are much cast down if this decision of the judges of their own party; and we should think it would open the eyes of those deluded men who have been incited to resist the law by men in high places. They will now find that Gov. Chase has no power to set aside the United States laws, and protect from punishment those whom his teachings and fulminations have incited to break them. These Oberlin cases will do a world of good. They have shown the healthy, national sentiment of our people in an eminent degree. It is demonstrated, that except the more violent and fanatical of the Republicans, all our citizens are against resistance to law, and will, if necessary, come forward to vindicate it.
From the Detroit Free Press.
CAUSE FOR ASTONISHMENT.
The division of the Supreme Court of Ohio, relative to the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, in the case of Bashnell, one of the Oberlin rescuers, must astonish the whole Republican host not a little. Here we have a Republican Court,-a majority of the judges belong to that persuasion,-unanimously refusing an application for a writ of habeas corpus for the man who is held up as a martyr of freedom because he has been convicted of resisting the United States officers, and liberating a fugitive slue from their custody. What will the party say of such conduct as this? Has the Court gone over to the slave drivers? Has it become the tool of the slave power? Is this decision another instance of subservience to Southern interests? How can the Court be apologized for? Or will it be repudiated by them, and their judges condemned? It was designed by the counsel of Bushnell, and his Republican coadjutors, that the Supreme Court of Ohio should place itself alongside of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, grant the writ, discharge the prisoner, and pronounce the fugitive law unconstitutional,-and that, notwithstanding the late decision of the Supreme Court of the United States adverse to the Wisconsin decision. But the Ohio Court has done no such thing; it has even taken ground more adverse to the Republicans than the United States Supreme Court itself; for, in the late decision in the Wisconsin case, it was granted that a State Court could issue a writ of habeas corpus upon a person held in custody by Federal authority, but it could not compel his dismissal. The Ohio Court did not even grant the writ, which it had the power to do according to this decision. Thus are the whole tribe of Abolitionists completely baffled; their own Court refuses to grant the writ and discharge the prisoner, rationality of the fugitive slave law.
We repeat that this decision of the Ohio court must astonish the black Republicans not A little. Their court in Michigan, in the case of Day vs. own, took more extreme ground than the United States Supreme Court, in the Dread Scott case, relative to the rights of negroes, and now their court in Ohio takes more extreme ground, relative to the writ of habeas corpus, than did the Federal tribunal. Truly, wonders will never cease! In this connection, we reproduce an extract from the New York Tribune, in which it animadverted with severity upon the decision of the Federal court no more than Ohio court?
'If the States of this Union have any political rights whatever, they have the right to defend and protect their citizens against all wrongs and all oppressions, and in certain cases their only resort would be the writ of habeas corpus. Deny them this, and the States cease to be the guardians and protectors of their own citizens.
'Any State of this Union that will yield to such an interpretation of its political rights as this, is only fit to be enslaved. The spirit of freedom spurns it with contempt.'
The exultation of these Border-Ruffian journals may yet be found to be somewhat premature

WHAT NEXT?
Extracts from a work entitled 'The Southern Spy; or, Curiosities of Negro Slavery in the South," by Edward A. Pollard, of Washington City:-
'I recognize, especially in the proposition to reopen the slave trade, the interests of the working-classes and yeomanry of the South. The case of the poor white population of the South cries to heaven for justice. We see a people who are devoted to their country, who must he entrusted with the defence of the institution of slavery, if ever assailed by violence, who would die for the South and her institutions, who in the defence of these objects of their patriotism would probably give to the world the most splendid examples of courage, who would lay down their simple and hardy lives at the command of Southern authorities, and who would rally around the standard of Southern honor in the reddest crashes of the battle-storm-we sea, I say, such a people treated with the most ungrateful and insulting consideration by their country, debarred from its social system, deprived of all share in the benefits of the institution of slavery, condemned to poverty, and even forced to bear the airs of superiority in black and beastly slaves! Is not this a spectacle to fire the heart? As sure as God is judge of my own heart, it throbs with ceaseless sympathy for these poor, wronged, noble people; and, if there is a cause in the world I would he proud to champion, it is theirs-so help me God!-it is theirs.'
'I am not ashamed, my dear C., to confess to be attached by affection to some of the faithful slaves of our family, to have sent them remembrances in absence, and, in my younger days, to have made little monuments over the grave of my poor "mammy." Do you think I could ever have borne to see her consigned to the demon Abolitionist, man or woman, and her lean, starved corpse rudely laid in a pauper's grave? No! At this moment my eyes are tilled with tears, when I look back through the mist of long years, upon the image of that dear old slave, and recollect how she loved ma in her simple manner; how, when chided even by any mother, she would protect and humor me; and how, in the long days of summer, I have wept out my boyish passion on her grave.'

SOUTHERN HONOR!
A PHILADELPHIA DRUMMER DRUMMED OUT OF HOLLY SPRINGS.-Lex Talionis.-For a week or two past, a Philadelphia darner, named Young, representing the exploded firm of Hoskins, Herskell & Co., has been in North Mississippi, settling up the affairs of the establishment. He went from this place, one day last week, to Holy Springs, having in his possession a requisition issued by tae Governor of Pennsylvania upon the Governor of Mississippi, demanding the person of Mr. A. R. Brown, formerly a merchant of Holly Springs, who failed about a year ago. It was alleged that Mr. Brown had obtained goods from the Philadelphia house, to the amount of about $4,000, under false pretences.
When Young arrived at Holly Springs, he placed the requisition in the hands of an officer, who was directed to proceed to the residence of Mr. Brown, about nine miles from town. But while an officer was proceeding to discharge that duty, it commenced being talked around the streets, and steps were inaugurated at once to prevent Young taking Brown to <illegible> a prisoner. Soon after supper, a crowd of citizens summoned Young to appear immediately at the Court House, to answer charges which would there be brought against him.

Arrived at the Court House, Gen. Jim Taylor appeared as prosecuting attorney, and the Hon. J. W. Clapp for the defence. We are not suffiently in-formed to give a minute detail of tae evidence. but the result of the trial was, that Mr. Young was required to give a heavy bond that he would produce and publicly burn the requisition, next morning, and that he would leave the vicinity, never to return. Next morning, he faithfully complied with the requirements, and left on the first train.
Whenever a Southerner goes to the city where this man Young and his confederates reside, in quest of property, in tae shape of slaves, he is set upon in a like manner, and we are sure they will have the generosity to excuse oar citizens for doing the same thing.

SELECTIONS.
REBUKE OF RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY.
Extract from an excellent sermon, entitled ' Christian Liberty vs. Ecclesiastical Despotism,' preached in the Stone Church. in Cortland, N. Y., April 3. 1859, by William H. Fish, Minster of the Society':
The Presbyterian Church-as any other church-may oppose our doctrines, our principles, our forms, and our methods of action; and if this is only done fairly, we will be content, and candidly listen to its criticisms. But when all under its influence are taught to shun us, and are threatened with ecclesiastical and social excommunication, unless they submit-if they even hear the lecturers that stop with us over Sunday-I must not be silent respecting such opposition. Tae rulers call it, as they do, 'meddling with their internal affairs,' for one not of them to take an active part against them in a trial like that of Mr. Brewer; but I think it a need full, though not a pleasant work, to awake the community to determined hostility to such bigotry and usurpation of authority. I would not, indeed, undertake this work from any mere personal interest in the matter, for I hive no such interest. I crave for myself and friends no favors of any kind from sectarians. But they have no Christian right to oppose the spread of new views of Christianity till they know, at least, what those views are from a personal examination of them; and much less have they any right to misrepresent and slander their advocates as ' infidels.' Silent submission to their dogmatic and unjust treatment of the friends of freedom, of righteousness and of human progress, is not for their own good, any more than it is for the world's good; and they should, therefore, be arraigned and put on trial as flagrant transgressors of the law of Christian Liberty. If there are Liberalists who think it best to stand and see their doctrines trampled under foot, without making any objection, I hare only to say, that is not my philosophy of reform. My philosophy-which I think I have learnt of Christ-is to throw all usurpers out of an aggressive into a defensive position. And it is fortunate that we have such men us Phillips, and Emerson, and Garrison, and Mayo, and Star King, and Curtis, to fight the battle of Freedom and Truth over-men who certainly stand before the world to-day as representatives of the highest style of manhood. They are called, hereabouts, by some pretenders, 'Boston Infidels;' but it is certainly a significant question-' If we can have such men without Christianity-and such women also, as Lacertian Mott and Florence Nightingale, who are likewise "infidels," what is the use of Christianity?' In saying that characters like theirs grow up under the influence of ' infidelity'-that Dr. Changing's did also-and that the John
<c03>
Calvins of the past, and the Nehemiah Adams of the present, are the very best results of Christianity, a fatal blow is given to Christianity. For, thinking and good men, under such circumstances, will be quite inclined to say, ' Give us infidelity then, instead of Christianity, for we want that which produce the noblest men and women.'
But no-these men who have been condemned by the Presbyterian Session as ' infidels,' are the genuine practical Christians of the age; and they need no one to speak in their defence in either an apologetic or patronizing manner. Nor could any one, fully delivered from sectarian bondage, even condescend to vindicate himself against the charge of hearing them speak as though it were a crime-not unless he did it, as Mr. Brewer did, presume, to establish a principle. It would be far more sensible for the people to put ministers and elders on trial for not hearing them, than for ministers and elders to put the people on trial for hearing them. To have heard such men as Wendell Phillips and Ralph Waldo Emerson is something to glory in, not to apologize for;-and in the most intelligent and excellent circles of Boston, or New York, or London, a man of any culture would be ashamed to confess that though these men had spoken in his own village, he had not ventured to hear them, for fear of the Minister and 'Elders '-or because superstitious man called them ' infidels!'
But though these representative men need no vindication, and would smile at any appeal for orthodox charity in their behalf, I have too high an estimation of them and of their labors to look on, in silences, and see their way to the popular mind and heart blockaded by bighted sectarians. Hence I affirm that they are vastly superior to the mass of the popular clergy-some of them even being the foremost in that profession-and that they, therefore, who try to prevent their being heard are deserving such rebuke as Christ gave to the Scribes and Pharisees of old. Only think of it-a little handful of men possessed only, at most, of the ordinary in elligence and virtue of respectable society, and with but a small share of general knowledge-two only of any special reading-assuming before this enlightened community to the virtual vicegerents of Christ on earth, with such powers as are claimed in the ' Confession of Faith '! powers to excommunicate a man from ' Christ's Church,' and therefore from the kingdom of heaven, for listening a few Sundays to the foremost thinkers, scholars, and religious teachers of the age or ages!

THE NEAPOLITAN EXILES.
The Anti-Slavery Standard contains a very investing latter from R (HARD D. WEBB, of Dublin, relating to the arrive of the Neapolitan exiles at Cork, and the warm sympathy every where exhibited in their behalf. Here is an extract from it, and a pleasant incident narrated:-
'I suppose it was in order to avoid the pains of a long sea voyage at this rough seasan of the year that the writer of that letter to which I have referred, with his companions in prison, the Baron Poerio, Dr. Braio, Dr. Stephano Millico, Signor Vincenzo Dono and Nicolo came by way of Dublin, to take the short passage of 60 miles from Kingstown (near Dablin) to Holyhead, and theme 270 miles by rail to London. Having early information of their time of leaving Cork, some of my friends and [ met them at the terminus in Dublin (where nobody else know anything about them), and had the great pleasure of being of some use to them during their short stay in Dublin. Some such assistance was indeed necessary, for only two of their party had even a slight knowledge of colloquial English, this remainder speaking only French and Italian. Daring that evening and the following morning previous to their sailing for Holyhead, we had a tow hours of social intercourse with these true martyrs of liberty, whose sufferings have now be-come a port of history. Of those who assembled to greet them, two were Professors of the University, and spoke Italian-me of them being the Italian Professor, Signor Marani, who, many years ago, himself suffered twenty-one months of chains and cruel imprisonment, from that twin brother of Bomba, the Duke of M. dena. Although the Neapolitan exiles had never seen this gentleman before, they know him by reputation, and received him as a longest brother. The Baron Poerio is a gentleman of great conversational power and remarkable accomplishments, intimately acquainted with general literature and politics. He is of low size, rather short, and bears evident traces of the severe treatment to which ha was for ten years subjected, embittered in every way by the meanest devices and the most malignant indignities. One of the exiles, who appeared much depressed, stated, in reply to expressions of sympathy, that he had not yet learned to realize the certainty of the change from such suffering to the experience of so much kind attention as they had experienced since their arrival in Ireland. You may imagine how delightful it was for us, in even so small a way, to prove to them that they were surrounded by friends who could appreciate and honor them for their sacrifices and sufferings.
An incident that will interest the readers of THE STANDARD is, that Miss Sarah Remond was of the social party that met them at the house of a friend on the evening of their arrival. I have seen fairer faces; but I have never seen one brighter, more intelligent, or batter 'lit up,' than was hers that whole evening. The exiles were deeply interested on being informed that she was here as the representative of a down-trodden race in a land of liberty, and their advocate before the British people. The Daca di Cabellino begged to be presented to her, and desired that she should be informed how, as one who had himself suffered from cruel oppression, he entirely sympathized with her and her noble mission. Several of the exiles handed her their cards, and the Baron Poerio gave her some lines with his autograph. In reply to repeated expressions of grateful acknowledgment for attentions which we ware only too glad to offer, we could only give the true reply that we felt honored and obliged by the opportunity.
Indeed, the enjoyment was so intense that when they ware fairly on their way to the glorious well come which awaits them in England, some of us felt as if a much longer experience of living had been compressed into a few hours. Some of the exiles hearing that Grist and Mario were in town, and expressing a great desire to be present at the Italian opera (which they had not seen for ten years), application was made to these famous singers; but they sent word that they ' were engaged.' Human nature is the same in Dublia and New York. The difficulty was probably the same which prevents a New York dealer from countenancing fugitive slaves. They dread their Southern customers. The Southern custom an of Grisi and her spouse are the tyrants of Italy, and very good customers too. The manager of the theatre, however, was prompt in gratifying the exiles, thanking them for the opportunity of doing so. What a row you would have in all the slave States if a Philadelphia manager were to express himself so to one of those band of heroes who so often make their way northwards by the help of Thomas Garrett! It is gratifying to know that the enthusiasm excited by the arrival of Poerio
<c04>
and his friends on British soil, the subscription on their behalf, and the spontaneous nature of their cordial welcome, have excited a profound interest in Naples. So I learn from this, morning's papers. This proves, I venture to think, that a similar excitement is created in Charleston by the indications of a strong anti-slavery sentiment in England. Will you tell Mrs. Stowe that her name is familiar to the exiles, and that they regard her as a ' woman and a sister'?
From the Providence Journal.
PERSECUTION OF THE METHODISTS BY
THE DEMOCRATS OF TEXAS.
It seems to have been decided in Texas, that the preaching of the gospel by the Methodist ministers is inconsistent with the propagation of Democracy and slavery. It is pretty difficult to expound the New Testament, and to enforce the precepts of the Savior, without hitting some of the prejudices of that region, and it is not improbable that the Methodist clergy have quoted some unfortunate text or enforced some unfortunate command. There ought to be an expurgated Bible for the special use of that large portion of our fellow-citizens who believe that the chief end of man is the propagation of human slavery. The Old Testament is perhaps well enough as it is; but the New is an innovation that is not at all adapted to the conservative views of the extreme South. Indeed, but for the affecting story of Oedipus, and the blessed text, ' Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters,' doubles being translated slave, it would be altogether an 'incendiary document,' and deserving to be classed with Uncle Tom's Cabin and some of the writings of Washington and Jefferson
Several demonstrations had been made against the preachers in communion with the Methodist Church North, before the meeting of the Conference near Bonham. It appears from an account in the Central Christian Advocate, that several persons, among them two clergymen, have been employed as spies to watch the religious meetings and the business assemblies of the Methodists, and to report any expression that could be twisted into opposition to slavery. They were not very successful. The good ministers seem to have imitated the prudence and mildness of the apostles, and to have given no cause of offence to the most vigilant and uncharitable guardians of slavery. Nevertheless, an indignation meeting of the citizens was held at Bonham, and what was lacking in facts was made up in resolutions. The following is a specimen of the proceedings:
Whereas, As a secret foe lurks in our midst, known as the Northern Methodist Church, entertaining sentiments antagonistic to the institution of slavery, and the manifest determination of its Northern coadjutors is to do away with slavery in these United States; and 
Whereas, The further growth of this enemy would be likely to endanger the perpetuity of that institution in Texas; and
Whereas, Sentiments diametrically opposed to the interests of the South have this day been publicly proclaimed upon our streets by a minister of said Northern Methodist Church; therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Methodist Church have separated into divisions, North and South-the organization of the northern branch of that Church in our midst, us a screen behind which to hide the emissaries of a northern political faction, known as the abolitionists, is dangerous to our interests, and ought not, therefore, to he tolerated by the people of Texas.
Resolved, That the public denunciation of the institution of slavery, and the public action by a minister of their Church, to the effect that the Northern Methodists designed the extirpation of that institution in our land, heard in our streets this day, was a gross insult to our people, and should be boldly and summarily resented.
Resolved, That the teachings and preaching of the ministers of that Church do not meet the views of the people, of Fanning county, and must therefore be stopped.
Resolved, That a committee be appointed to memorialize the legislature to pass laws to punish the utterance of such seditious sentiments as are mentioned in resolution second, and that other counties be earnestly called on to consider the matter.
Resolved, That a suitable committee be appointed to wait on the Bishop and ministers now in Conference assembled, on Timber Creek, in this county, and warn them to withhold the further prosecution of said Conference, as its continuance will be well calculated to endanger the peace of this community.
Resolved, That our motto be, peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must.
The committee appointed to wait on the peaceful Bishop numbered fifty men, one of them a Presbyterian, clergy man. They interrupted him as he had given out his text and commenced his sermon, and with violent and inflammatory language forbade the continuance of the Conference, and threatened that unless their demands were complied with, blood would be shed. They graciously allowed the minister and brethren two hours for deliberation, before proceeding to extremities. The principal speaker announced that he was a member of the Methodist Church South. At the expiration of the two hours, a committee from the Conference was sent to the representatives of the mob, to report that they would refrain from preaching till they had consulted their Quarterly Conferences, so that the preaching was stopped and the nub triumphed.
Another meeting of the citizens was held to receive the report of their committee. At this meeting a man was called up in to give testimony to sustain the charge of abolitionism against the Methodist church, and the Hon. Gideon Smith stated, with much particularity, the startling fact that he had heard that a negro belonging to Joshua Cox had commenced attending the religious meeting, and had been useless to his master ever since. Joshua was called and gave his testimony to the allegation, in all its enormous length and breadth. The negro had formed the habit of passing his evenings at the house of one James Rose, where, instead of the improving and profitable game of poker, the bible and similar books were read, the effect of which had been to inspire the ungrateful nigger with a disposition to take to preaching and buy his freedom. At first the master was gratified, being under the impression that when negroes were made religious and well-informal, more work could be got out of them. Discovering his error in this respect, the paternal Joshua requested Rose to flog tho negro, ana send him home. To this reasonable demand, Rose, who had undoubtedly become infected with the poison of the Methodist Conference, replied that he did not feel like driving away a poor fellow who came there for religious instruction. What could Joshua do? He sold the negro, and put the money into his virtuous packet; and there he stood to give his testimony to the dangerous consequence of having ministers and Methodists at large. This testimony was regarded by the 'citizens' as an abundant justification of the proceedings. The Rev. Mr. Porter, a minister of the Methodist church South, made a speech in which he said that he considered the Northern division of the church as thoroughly abolitionzed. The Texas Advocate, the organ of the Methodist church South, fully justifies the proceedings, and counsels force, if it be necessary, to eradicate the Methodist church South. It may be reasonably hoped that the prompt and active demonstration of the patriotic citizens of Bonham have ' saved the Union,'

A SLAVE GIRL'S NARRATIVE.
Cordelia Loney, slave of Mrs. Joseph Cahell, of Fredericksburg Va.-Cordelia's Escape from her Mistress in Philadelphia.
To the Editors of the N. Y. Evening Post:
With the hope that your readers may be interested, and the cause of freedom promoted, I wish to present a very brief narrative of Cordelia Loney, us I received it from her own lips, candidly and truthfully told, as I have every reason to believe.
A little over a month ago, in the capacity of servant, Cordelia Loney, a colored woman, was brought to this city by her mistress, (Mrs. Joseph Cahell, widow of the late Hon. Joseph Cahell, of Virginia,) with the hope, obviously, of holding her as securely in bonds in Philadelphia, during her stay, asin Virginia.
Having engaged board for a month at a fashionable private boarding-house on Chestnut street, she took an early opportunity to caution Cordelia against going into the streets, and against having anything to say or do with ' iree niggers in particular;' withal, she appeared unusually kind, so much so that, before retiring to bed in the evening, she would call Cordelia to her chamber, and by her side would take her Prayer-book and Bible, and go through the forms of devotional service. For she stood very high both as a church communicant and a lady in society.
For a fortnight it seemed as though her prayers were to be answered, for Cordelia acted as submissively as usual, and the Madam enjoyed calls and accepted invitations from some of the elite of the city, without suspecting an intention on the part of Cordelia to escape. But Cordelia could not forget how her children had all been sold by her mistress.

She is about fifty-seven years of age, with about an equal proportion of colored and white blood in her veins; very neat, respectful, and prepossessing in manner.
From her birth to the hour of her escape, she had worn the yoke under Mrs. C., as her most efficient and reliable maid-servant. She had been at her mistress's beck and civil as seamstress, waiting-maid, nurse in the sick-room, &c., &c., under circumstances that might appear to the casual observer as being uncommonly favorable for a slave. Indeed, on my first interview, I was so forcibly impressed with the belief that her condition in Virginia had been favorable, that I hesitated to ask her if she did not desire her liberty. A few moments' conversation with her, however, convinced me of her good sense and decision of purpose in regard to this matter. For, in answer to the first question I put to her, she answered me that she ' wanted to be free,' and was ' bound to leave;' that she had been ' treated very cruelly;' that her children had ' all been sold away ' from her; that she had been threatened with sale herself ' on the first insult,' &c.
She was willing to take upon herself the entire responsibility of taking care of herself. On the suggestion of a friend, before leaving her mistress, she was disposed to sue for her freedom, but upon a reconsideration of the matter, she chose rather to accept the hospitality of the Underground Railroad, and leave in a quiet way and go to Canada, where she would be free indeed. Accordingly, she thus left her mistress, and was soon a free woman.
The following sad experience she related calmly in the presence of several friends, an evening or two after she had left her mistress:
Two sons and two daughters had been sold from her by her mistress, within the last three years, since the death of her master. Three of her children had been sold to the Richmond market, and the other to Nelson county.
Paullina was the first sold, two years ago last May. Nat was the next; he was sold to Abram Warrick, of Richmond. Paulina was sold before it was named to her mother that it had entered her mistress's mind to dispose of her. Nancy, from infancy, had been in poor health. Nevertheless, she had been obliged to take her place in the field with the rest of the slaves, of more rugged constitution, until she had passed her twentieth year, and had become a mother. Under these circumstances, the overseer and his wife complained to the mistress that her health was really too bad for a field hand, and begged that she might be taken where her duties would be less oppressive. Accordingly she was withdrawn from the field, and was set to spinning and weaving. When too sick to work, her mistress invariably took the ground that nothing was the matter,' notwithstanding the fact that her family physician, Dr. Elsom, had pronounced her 'quite weakly and sick.'
In an angry mood one day, Mrs. Cahell declared she would cure her, and again sent her to the field, ' with ordure to the overseer to whip her every day, and make her work or kill her.' Again the overseer said it was ' no use to try, for her health would not stand it,' and she was forthwith returned.
Now the mistress concluded to cell her.
One Sabbath evening, a nephew of hers, who resided in New Orleans, happened to be on a visit to his aunt, when it occurred to her that she had better get Nancy off if possible. Accordingly Nancy was called in for examination. Being dressed in her 'Sunday best,' and ' before & poor candle light,' she appeared to good advantage; and the nephew concluded to start with her on the following Tuesday morning. However, the next morning he happened to see her by the light of the sun, and in her working garments, which satisfied him that he had been grossly deceived; that she would barely live to reach New Orleans; hence he positively refused to carry out the previous evening's contract, thus leaving her in the hands of her mistress, with the advice that she should' doctor her up.

The mistress, not disposed to be defeated, obviated the difficulty by selecting a little boy, made a lot of the two, and thus made it an inducement to a purchaser to buy the sick woman, The boy and woman brought $700.
About the sale of her children, Cordelia was consulted about as much as if she had been a cow.
'I felt wretched,' she said, with emphasis, when I heard that Nancy had been sold,' which was not until after she had been removed. ' But,' she continued, 'I was not at liberty to make my grief known to a single white soul. I wept, and couldn't help it.' But remembering that she was liable, 'on the first insult,' to be sold herself, she sought no sympathy from her mistress, whom she describes as 'a woman who shows as little kindness towards her servants as any woman in the States of America. She neither likes to feed or clothe well.'
With regard to fogging, however, in. days past, she had been up to the mark. ' A many a slap and blow' had Cordelia received since she arrived at womanhood, directly from the madam's own hand.
One day, smarting under cruel treatment, she appealed to her mistress in the following strain: 'I stood by your mother in all her sickness, and nursed her till she died! I waited on your niece night and day, for months, till she died! I waited upon your husband all my life-in his sickness especially, and shrouded him in death, &c., &c., yet I am treated cruelly.' It was of novail.
<c06>
Her mistress at one time was the owner of about five hundred slaves, but within the last few years she had greatly lessened the number by sales.
She stood very high as a lady, and was a member of the Episcopal Church.
To punish Cordelia, on several occasions she had been sent to one of the plantations to work as a field hand. Fortunately, however, she found the overseers more compassionate than her mistress, though she received no particular favors from any of them.
Asking, her to name the overseers, &c., she did so. The first was ' Marks, a thin-visaged, poor looking man, great for swearing.' The second was 'Gilbert Brower, a very rash, portly man. 'The third was 'Buck Young, a stout man, and very sharp.' The fourth was ' Lynn Powel, a tall man. with red whiskers, very contrary and spiteful.' There was also a fifth one, but his name I lost.
Thus Cordelia's experience, though chiefly con fined to the 'great house,' extended occasionally over the corn and tobacco fields, among the overseers and field hands generally. But under no circumstances could she find it in her heart to be thankful for the privileges of slavery.
After leaving her mistress she learned, with no small degree of pleasure, that a perplexed state of things existed at the boarding-house; that her mistress was seriously puzzled to imagine how she would get her shoes and stockings on and off; how she would get her head combed, get dressed, be attended to in sinkness, &c., as she (Cordelia) had been compelled to serve all her life.
Most of the boarders, being slaveholders, naturally sympathized in her affliction; and some of them went so far as to offer a reward to some of the colored servants to gain a knowledge of her whereabouts. Some charged the servants with having a hand in her leaving, but all agreed that ' she had left a very kind and indulgent mistress,' and had acted very foolishly in running out of slavery into Freedom.
A certain Doctor of Divinity, the pastor of an Episcopal church in this city, and a friend of the mistress, hearing of her distress, by request or voluntarily, undertook to find out Cordelia's place of seclusion. Hailing on the street a certain colored man with a familiar face, who he thought knew nearly all the colored people about town, be related to him the predicament of his lady friend from the South, remarked how kindly she had always treated her servants, signified that Cordelia would rue the change, and be left to suffer among the ' miserable blacks down town,' that she would not be able to take care of herself; quoted Scripture justifying shivery, and finally suggested that he would be doing a duty and a kindness to the fugitive, by using his influence to find her, and prevail upon her to return.
However, it so happened that the colored man addressed had experienced quite a number of years as a slave at the South; had himself once been pursued as a fugitive, and having, by his industry in the condition of freedom, acquired a handsome estate, he felt entirely qualified to reply to the raved-end gentleman, which he did, though in not very respectful phrases, telling him that Cordelia had as good a right to her liberty as he bad, or her mistress either; that God had never intended one man to be the slave of another; that it was all false about the slaves being batter off than the free colored people; that he would find as many ' poor, miserably degraded ' of his own color, ' down town,' as he would among the ' degraded blacks;' and concluded by telling him that he would rather give her a hundred dollars to help her off, than to do aught to inform him of her whereabouts, if he knew ever so much about them.
What further steps were taken by the discomfited divine, the mistress, or her boarding-house sympathizers, I have not been informed.
But with regard to Cordelia: She took her departure for Canada in the midst of the late Daniel Webster (Fugitive) trial, week before last, with the hope of being permitted to enjoy the remainder of her life in freedom and peace. Being a member of the Baptist church, and professing to be a Christian, she was persuaded, by industry and the assistance of the Lord, away would be opened to the seeker, of freedom even in a strange land and among strangers.

GOLDEN WEDDING.
A family festival in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the marriage of Dr. Pelage Clarke and wife, of Coventry, was held at the Earl House in this city, on Saturday evening last. The company consisted of their children, grandchildren, other relatives and friends resident in this city, State, and neighboring States.
The reception commenced at six o'clock, and the ample drawing-rooms were soon filled, the time being occupied with mutual congratulations and friendly social intercourse, until half-past eight, when we were summoned to the dining-room, and upwards of sixty persons sat down to a sapper, elegantly prepared, under the direction of Mr. Kilburn, the manager of this excellent house.
At the head of the table was a superb wedding-cake, ornamented with appropriate emblematic device and inscription; which, together with other articles, were presents to the bride.
After supper, the elder brother, Dr. Clarke, of Fall River, on behalf of the family, expressed their gratification at meeting so many of their relatives and friends on the occasion; and in order to show the legitimacy of the proceedings, read the following ancient document:
'This may certify whom it may concern, that Pelage Clarke of Johnston, in the county of Providence, son of Weeded Clarke of Richmond, and Marietta Flake, daughter of Isaac Finke of Johnston aforesaid, were lawfully joined together in marriage this twenty-third day of April, Anno Domini, 1809, by me,
BENJ. WHIPPLE, Justice Peace.'
Elder Westcott, a Baptist clergyman, had been engaged to perform the marriage service, but was prevented from doing so by sickness in his family.
Next followed the impressive ceremony of presenting to the parents by their children a family picture, containing photographic likenesses of the parents, nine children, with the conjugal partners of seven, being all who are married. Then came a response from the venerable Doctor, on behalf of himself and wife, giving also a retrospective new off some of the most prominent incidents of their eventful lives.
Accounts from absent member of the family, reading of.' Lanes from an absent Niece to her Uncle,' interesting addresses by several relatives and friends, concluded the exercises at the table When again in the drawing-rooms, social converse until the hammer of the church; clock reminded us that it was time to separate.
A happier social gathering, we venture to assert, has not recently convened in this city. Dr. Clarke is one of the oldest practitioners of medicine in the State, being one of the four now living of the forty-nine who petitioned the Legislature, and abstained a charter for Medical Society, in 1812. He was the first, physician out of the city to adopt the Homeopathic system. He has been one of the strong men of his day, a pioneer in the philanthropic and re-
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
The United States Constitution is ' a covenant with death, and an agreement with Hell."
'The free States are the guardians and essential supports of slavery. We are the jailers' and constables of the institution.... There is some excuse for communities, when, under a generous impulse, they espouse the cause of the oppressed in other States, and by force restore their rights; but they are without excuse in aiding other States in binding an men an unrighteous yoke. On this subject, OUR FATHERS, IN FRAMING THE CONSTITUTION, SWERVED FROM THE RIGHT. We their children, at the end of helf a century, see the path of duty more clearly than they, and must walk in it. To this point the public mind has long been tending, and the time has come for looking at it fully, dispassionately, and with manly and Christian resolution.... No blessing of the Union can be a compensation for taking part in the enslaving of our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to be perpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that it can only continue through our participation in wrong doing. To this conviction the free States are tending.'

NATURE OF THE DECISION. The New York Times is totally mistaken in the contrast which it draws between the action of the Supreme Court of Ohio in the case of Bushnell, and that of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in the case of Booth. So far as matters have yet gone, the Supreme Court of Ohio, instead of pursuing, as the Times supposes, a course diametrically opposite to that of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, has been guided in rejecting the application made to it for a writ of habeas corpus entirely by the precedent established by the Wisconsin Court. Booth's case was twice before that Court. The first application to it was immediately after Booth had been arrested. The application was refused on the ground that the matter was still pending and undecided in the United States Court, and that there was no ground at that time to apply to the State Court on Booth's behalf, since it was to be supposed that, if the proceedings against him were inconsistent with his rights as a citizen of Wisconsin, the United States Court would so decide, and would accordingly discharge him. It was upon this principle, and upon this precedent, that the late decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio was based. There were, indeed, some differences between the two cases, but none which touched this principle. Booth's case was a civil suit to recover a penalty, while Bushnell'e is a criminal procedure. Booth's application was made immediately after his arrest. Bushnell's not until after the verdict of a jury had been recorded against him; but in both cases no civil judgment had been rendered, and therefore in both cases alike the application was premature. It was like attempting to carry a case up to a Court of Appeals on the ground of defects in the declaration or indictment, without waiting for the judgment of the lower Court thereon.
After final judgment had been rendered against Booth, he made a second application to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and it was upon that application that the judgment was rendered to which the Times refers. It appears to be the intention of Bushnell and his counsel, after judgment is rendered against him, to make a second, application to the Ohio Supreme Court. In deciding the former case, the Court carefully avoided any expression of opinion upon any of the points which would be involved in this new application, and it still remains to be seen whether the Court, having followed the Wisconsin precedent in the one case, will not follow it also in the other.ï¿½N.

From the Waterford (Ireland) Mall, April 19.
AMERICAN SLAVERY 
A meeting was held in the New Room, Town Hall, on Wednesday evening, on the above subject, at which Miss Remond, a lady of color, from America, attended. The chair was taken by John Elliot, Esq., M. D.
Among those present we noticed the Rev. James Lawson, Rev. Thomas Gimlette, Rev. J. N. Wilson, Rev. Ambrose Lawson, Rev. Thomas Wilshere, Rev. William McCance, Rev. J. McKeen, Thomas Wilson, Thomas Barnes, James Walpole, Thomas S. Harvey, Samuel V. Peet, Joseph Fisher, James G. Palmer, William Kizbey, &c., and a very large number of ladies. The Right Worshipful the Mayor was prevented by a previous engagement from attending and taking the chair. The very Rev. the Dean of Waterford, had also intended to be present, but was prevented by the fatigue from his journey from England.
The Chairman, in introducing Miss Remond to the meeting, said the present meeting was convened in consequence of a wish that had been expressed by some of those who had attended Miss Remond's previous meetings, that they might have the opportunity of expressing their feelings on the subject of American slavery; and although Miss Remond had kindly attended, and would address them, the primary object of the meeting was to enable those present to express their views; and it was intended, on the conclusion of the meeting, to submit resolutions to them for their adoption. He then introduced 
Miss SARAH REMOND, who, in her usual forcible and eloquent style, exposed the evils of American slavery, and pointed out the objects which the abolitionists had placed before them. They looked for sympathy to the British people; they looked to them for an expression of opinion in favor of the slave; such opinion would be listened to in America with great attention, and help to strike the fetters from the slave. After a very eloquent address, Miss Remond resumed her seat, among the plaudits of the audience.
The Rev. Thomas Wishere rose to move the first resolution, which wasï¿½ 
'That this meeting, believing slavery to be iniquitous and impolitic, mischievous in its influences on the oppressors and the oppressed, and both a calamity and a reproach to the community in which it is tolerated, deplores the support and connivance which that system obtains in the United States of America, not only on account of its inherent iniquity, but also of its utter incompatibility with the boasted civil and religious liberty of that great and high professing people.'
In moving the first resolution, he said he thought it right to rebuke an attempt which had been made to identify him with, and hold him responsible for, every opinion uttered or strong expression used by the lady who had so ably addressed them. That Miss Remond should thoroughly detest American slavery was very natural and proper, and she was perfectly justified in exposing and condemning the apathy and wicked silence of the Northern churches; but if her just indignation led to the utterance of extreme views upon the personal character of the members of these churches, or the late religious revivals in America, she alone was accountable for them. At the same time, it was due to her to say, that he believed the lecturer was fully entitled to the confidence of all who desired to awaken public attention to the enormities of the slave system, and he heartily joined in its unqualified condemnation. Upon the general subject he wished to express his decided conviction that there is no parallel whatever between the slavery of the Old Testament economy, and that which exists in America. If the slave owners of the Southern States would take the Mosaic code as their statute book, our quarrel with them would cease; for by that authority the man who stole, received or sold another was to be put to death-Exodus 21, 16; Deut. 24, 7. And from other passages we learn that if a slave received an injury, he had a right to escape from his master; and if any one delivered up the fugitive, he was held to be a transgressor. It had been asked did the New Testament expressly prohibit the holding of a slave. He was ashamed that such a question should be started by any professing Christian. Surely the great author of Christianity was not compelled to reveal His will in mere prohibition or commands. He has been pleased to inculcate certain principles, and to require a spirit or disposition in accordance therewith. His religion is one of love, and cannot sanction or tolerate the cruelties and abominations inseparable from a state of 'involuntary servitude.' But if any person require direct preceptive teaching on the subject, he will find it in such phrases as these: 'Love thy neighbor as thyself;' 'As ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; 'Thou shalt do no murder;' 'Thou shalt not commit adultery;' for none of these can be observed where slavery exists.
Then this peculiar 'institution' of America is a great social blunder. Forced labor cannot be so productive as voluntary; hence the desire of the planters to gain new territories, where the virgin soil and accumulated manure of ages will enable them, to compete with the skilled, remunerated, and industrious laborer of the northern States. That it is a crime against God and man to debase an accountable and rational being beneath the beasts which perish, by holding him, though innocent, in bondage, no candid person will deny. If this be so, and 'the Creator has made of one blood all nations of men that dwell upon the face of the earth,' it is the duty of all present to regard the slave as a man
<c02>
and a brother; to let the oppressed know that we sympathize with and pray for them; and to proclaim with a voice of thunder to the iniquitous oppressors that we will have no fellowship with their works of darkness, but will rather reprove them. On these grounds he was happy in moving the resolution.
The Rev. William McCance, in a brief and appropriate speech, seconded the resolution, which was passed unanimously. 
Mr. S. V. Peet then rose to propose the second resolution, viz:
'That this meeting rejoices to learn that the cause of emancipation is steadily gaining on the public mind in America, and earnestly desires the success of all legitimate measures undertaken on its behalf, and the encouragement of the friends of the oppressed in their noble and self-sacrificing efforts in the cause of freedom.'
He said he would not trespass many minutes on the patience of the meeting at that late hour of the evening; that the eloquent speech which they had just heard from Miss Remond was sufficient in itself, without any addition from him. to enforce the resolution, but that nevertheless he desired to say a few words for the sake of expressing his concurrence in those sentiments, and, if he might be permitted to use an American phrase, to endorse them. One branch of the resolution referred to the progress of the cause of abolition, and with reference to that it was indeed encouraging to find that so great a change of sentiment had gradually come about in the northern States within the last thirty years, where the advocates of abolition used, at the outset of their labors, to be pursued by mobs, clothed in the garb of gentlemen, and pelted with brickbats. Let us hope that the great cause will spread till the whole of the United States are pervaded with one sentiment in favor of emancipation. It might be asked what amount of influence could we bring to bear upon this question? He would say that the American people regarded the British nation with a filial reverence. The animosities of former years were well nigh forgotten. Public opinion here operated powerfully there, and hence we ought to foster a strong public opinion in favor of abolition. Moreover, thousands of emigrants annually flocked hence to the American continent. Such emigrants had hitherto incurred the reproach of adhering to the cause of slavery. That stigma ought no longer to exist; and if a powerful bias were created here, in favor of abolition, the emigrants would carry it with them across the Atlantic. Let us hope that Miss Remond's mission will powerfully conduce to the awakening of this feeling. Practical efforts might also be made in favor of abolition by contributions to the annual bazaars, in Boston and Rochester, the object of which is to raise funds to assist the fugitive slave.
Mr. Fisher then came forward, and was received with much applause. He said-I feel, Mr. Chairman, Ladies, and Gentlemen, that at this late hour of the evening you will all consider 'brevity is the soul of wit,' and yet I must ask you to bear with me for a few minutes, as I think the magnitude of the important question at issue demands a little of your thoughts. You have heard Miss Remond's eloquent address this evening, and some of you have listened to her with equal interest on previous occasions. It is not for me to say anything laudatory of her-you have heard her yourselves. She has brought before you the question of American slavery, the foulest and most infamous blot on humanity that ever existed at any time in any nation under heaven. She has told you of the state of upwards of four millions of people, who, by no wrong which they have done, are the victims of a policy so atrocious, that no Christian man can contemplate it without horror and dismay-(hear, hear.) American slavery is the most detestable, debasing, depraving and demoralizing institution that ever existed. What is it? It makes man, who was formed as God's image,-man, who is a sentient creature,-man, who is an immortal being,-man, who is responsible for his acts-it places him in the power of another. It deprives him of the right to think, to act, to feel; it makes him a mere chattel, which is to have no will, no wishes, no thoughts, no feelings of his own. Oh God! how cruel is this state of bondage -to think that man is to exist as if he had no mind to be improved-no soul to be saved-no feelings to be respected-no parents-no wife-no children; that he is to be reduced to the state of a brute, with no enjoyment in this world, no hope in the world to come. I ask any one of you to picture to yourself the state of the American slave. Try and place one of yourselves in his position. Fancy yourselves divested of all the comforts you enjoy; of your homes, your families. Fancy, if you can, what it is to have nothing of your own; liable to have those you love torn from you, and sold away from you. Try and realize your state, if you possessed nothing, and that you were liable at any moment, at the whim of a tyrant, to be flogged and mutilated. Oh, misery inexpressible! If this were the lot of a single individual, he would have your sympathy; and are you then to withhold it when four millions of your fellow-creatures are suffering under this yoke? when all that is noble in manhood, or lovely in womanhood, is outraged, disgraced, and disregarded? Can you withhold your sympathies from the slaves? No; you cannot. Your past conduct shows that your sympathies are with them. When England possessed eight hundred thousand slaves in her West India islands, you felt for them; and, to secure their freedom, you cheerfully paid your share of the price. You feel no less for the four millions of slaves held in bondage by your Anglo-Saxon brethren in the United States. And what will you tell them? You cannot look on in snllen indifference; you cannot see our common humanity outraged, and remain unmoved. England was the first nation who realized the idea that her land was a land of freedom-(hear, hear.) England struck the fetters from her own slaves, and set a noble example to the world; and whoever sets foot on British land is free. The broad banner of St. George floats on the confines of Canada; and how often do the eyes of the poor slaves brighten with delight when they think, that under the shadow of the banner of England, they cease to be chattels; they feel that they are men-(cheers.) And are we to be silent? Are the people of Waterford to be silent? Are the people of Ireland to withhold their voices? Forbid it, heaven! Erin stands with her face to the west, the nearest land to the New World, and every wave that surges from our shore, and rolls in thunder along the coast of America, shall say from us to the slave-owner-'Free your slaves'-(cheers.) Every breeze that floats over our green isle shall waft in soft accents to the poor oppressed the message of our sympathy for their suffering, and our longing for their emancipation-(cheers.) Yes, we will say to the slave owners that they are degenerate scions of a worthy race; that they are undeserving of their British descent, unworthy of the freedom to which they aspire. I am not surprised that freedom for the whites does not exist in America, for it cannot exist beside slavery. Slavery is a moral up as tree that kills all that approaches it; there is no freedom of thought, no freedom of speech, no freedom of action in America: a man dare not express his views on slavery, or he will be mobbed. Miss Remond has told you, and told you truly, that this question is now affecting the white as well as the black; that it is no longer a question of color; and so it is, and so it must be. You cannot have perfect freedom and absolute slavery co-existent in the same State. I have been told that slavery is an institution of America, and that we have no right to interfere with it; but this argument is worth nothing. If it were, we should hear that Paganism was the institution of other countries, and therefore we had no right to preach Christianity there, and thus all Christian, all missionary efforts would cease.
Pity, oh! pity this nation of slaves, pagans in a Christian land, but worse than pagans, because they are not masters even of their own bodies; worse than pagans, because good and Christian men go to pagan lands, they teach them to read, they teach them to pray, they give them God's word, but in some of the states of America a Christian missionary dare not land. The punishment of death is awarded to those who teach them to read, or who give them the bible. Are you desirous to benefit them, to convert them, to give them God's word. You must first set them free, and this can, I trust, be done by moral means. The noble band of abolitionists have done much, and I pray they may be enabled to do more, for I could not say that the slave would be wrong who would rise on his master and obtain his freedom; nor would I judge hastily those who would by might regain those rights of which they have been deprived -(cheers). I spoke of that heroic body, the abolitionists, and I assert that they are the best friends of the slave owners, and why, because every effort they make for the freedom of the slave is an effort to restore the slave owner to a higher condition. I cannot but protest against the worship of wealth
<c03>
which characterizes America: that worship of the "almighty dollar" which distinguishes the American people, and which makes dollars and cents the highest objects of human existence: for I am here to maintain that there is greater good than mere wealth, and the truth that 'the love of money is the root of all evil' is as apparent now as it was 1800 years ago. Slavery has demoralised and debased the slave owner. Look at Virginia, called after our noble Queen Elizabeth, whose name is associated with the idea of freedom. Look at it; at the time of the Union, it was the backbone of America, it possessed an old gentry, chivalrous and noble, now what is it? a slave breeding State, which degrades woman, and looks solely for wealth from a sale of young slaves, and her gentry have gone, the old families are gone, the chivalric feeling is gone, and I tell you, I. tell the slave-owners, that the feeling of the slaves cannot much longer be trifled with; they are standing on a slight shell, under which is a sea of lava. They know not when it may engulph them, and their truest friends are the abolitionists, those who are urging them to use the time which is granted, and to grant liberty to the slaves (cheers). Ladies and gentlemen, I feel I have detained you too long. I have a resolution to propose-I have asked no one to second it, and I will ask you all to second it by standing up. My resolution is this:
'That this meeting has listened with much interest to the eloquent appeal made by Miss Sarah Remond, on behalf of the oppressed people of color; and in returning her its sincere thanks, desires that her labors may enlist the sympathies and the energies of the British public in the cause of the abolition of slavery.'
The whole meeting thereupon rose to second the resolution, which was carried by acclamation.
The Chairman, in putting the resolution to the meeting, said they had heard Miss Remond, and had to a man risen to second it. What he most admired in Miss Remond was her truthfulness. She was not afraid to speak the truth, though it might give some offence. He hoped her mission to this country would do good, and tend to remove the fetters from the slave. The state to which the slave was reduced was best illustrated by a recent judicial decision. A slave-owner was indicted for cruelly treating a slave, and the Chief Justice, in charging the grand jury, told them that a slave had no rights, and therefore they could not entertain the bill, which was thus thrown out. This proved that the slave had less rights than brutes had in this country. This was a solemn judicial decision. He presented the thanks of the meeting to Miss Remond.
Mr. S. V. Peet moved the Rev. Mr. M'Cance to the chair: and the thanks of the meeting were then given to Dr. Elliot, and the meeting separated.

THE LATE AFFLICTIVE BEREAVEMENT.
Extract of a letter from Aaron M. Powell:-
'We were all deeply pained by  the announcement, which came to us through the Tribune of Saturday last, of the death of our friend, Charles F. HOVEY. When I last saw him here in the autumn, he was suffering much from the rheumatic difficulty, and had been unable to get relief; but I little thought that so soon he would thus be removed from his field of active labor, so largely abounding in good works. However much we may lament the change, we may find great consolation in the rare testimonial of a life of uncommon usefulness which he leaves behind.
Living in a period, and among a people with whom so generally and so shamefully wealth is used for the gratification of personal ambition and the promotion of political corruption, his is a most rare and noble example of unselfish and conscientious devotion to the cause of truth and humanity.
The Anti-Slavery cause, so much a part of his existence, and so largely indebted to his heart and hand, can ill afford thus to lose one of its chiefest pillars. But I believe that such is the nature of the spiritual constitution and the goodness of God, that the pulsations of a large heart are not wholly lost, to us in the change called death.'
Extract of a letter from E. H. Heywood:
'Dear brother HOVEY, then, is dead! I was startled at the announcement, a day or two since, in the papers, as I had not supposed he was dangerously ill. I never met him but once-that was after he was confined  to his couch, when a friend kindly took me to his house. Little did I think then that it was his death-bed. His genial, earnest, and manly countenance and conversation, on that brief interview, I shall never forget. How much he will be missed! Did the success of our cause depend upon an arm of flesh, well might we despair, as the 'gap-men are falling on the right and left.'
For the Liberator.
'HE IS NOT DEAD.'
Thoughts suggested by the falling asleep of that true man, and faithful worker in the cause of freedom,
CHARLES F. HOVEY.
If it be true-'Death loves a shining mark,'
He did not miss his aim when HOVEY fell;
For few there be who on life's sea embark,
Who do its duties-bear its ills so well.
They from earth's labors sweetly rest
Who've toiled through life to make earth blest;
This truth believed, we shall not mourn
That in life's prime our brother's gone.
He lived with life's great end in view,
To God and his own nature true:
And when at length his race was run,
A voice from heaven-proclaimed, 'Well done.'
He sleepeth sweetly-he's not dead;
'They never die,' hath Jesus said,
'Who live for me '-' because I live,
Eternal life to them I give.'
Let those whose hearts o'erflow with grief,
Who fain in tears would find relief,
While smarting 'neath affliction's rod,
Repose, with holy trust, in God.
'The widow,' He hath said,-'I'll bless;
Preserve her babes, left fatherless;
I'll be her God-their Father be-
Then let the widows trust in me.'
Our brother, ere his life was spent,
Built his own lasting monument;
Reason and Truth its solid base,
In Deeds-not words-it has its place.
May those permitted to survive,
Like the departed strive to live,
That when we're summoned earth to leave,
Each may 'a crown of joy' receive!

SYMPATHY AND ANTIPATHY.
The Baltimore correspondent of the Traveller recently wrote to that paper that the death of Rev. H. V. D. Johns, D. D., of Baltimore, had caused a gloom, such as the death of no other man in that city could cause to come over it. He was an Episcopal clergyman, bat was sufficiently free from sectarianism to mingle with other denominations and preach in their churches, an intermixture to which his proslavery character raised no objection on their parts since they themselves were slaveholders.
In November last, Dr. Johns was chosen President of a Convention held in Baltimore, composed of colporteurs of the American Tract Society operating in slaveholding States. This Convention was held by the Maryland Branch, but was attended by two of the Reverend Secretaries of the National Society, Messrs. Eastman and Stevenson, the latter of whom made a report of the meeting in the American Messenger the official organ of the American Tract Society) certifying that the spirit of Dr. Johns was eminently 'Christlike,' and that he wished there were more such men. This Convention was preceded by a union prayer meeting of the Baltimore people (slaveholders and others) which lasted nine consecutive hours.
Very likely the devotion of Dr. Johns to the interests of slavery would have made him at anytime a favored candidate for the Presidency of such a Convention. But, as Dr. South-side Adams of this city has been specially honored and complimented by the piety pf Boston since he wrote his famous defence of slavery, so probably Dr. Johns was selected for particular favor on an occasion so important to the slave cause, in consequence of his services to that cause in the annual meeting, six months before, of the American Tract Society.
It will be remembered that in that meeting the pro-slavery policy pursued by the Tract Society from its commencement was sustained, by a triumphant vote, against the small, but pertinacious minority which had protested against it. Dr. Johns, after expressing his high gratification at the spirit of the meeting, spoke in explanation of the position in which the slaveholding members and friends of the Society were placed. He said that the Baltimore delegation were charged not to agitate this question of slavery in the meeting, but merely to vote to sustain the Executive Committee, to sustain the Constitution of the Society as it had been administered for thirty years, and to assure its officers that their slaveholding friends were entirely satisfied, and more than satisfied, with the whole administration of its affairs.
The purpose of Dr. Johns to follow these prudent instructions (the echo of the whole policy of the Tract Society) seems to have been overcome by the pungency of some of the questions and comments of the minority, for he proceeded to say-
'The question was asked here to-day, Is the law of God against adultery obliterated in the face of slavery? I put it to you, Christians as you are, how trying were such remarks to a Southern man. I said nothing; I felt more like praying than making a response.'
We-have no doubt that this feeling was genuine, and the desire of Dr. Johns a heart-felt one, both that such troublesome minuteness of inquiry might be refrained from, and that, if such questions must be asked, he might be allowed to meet them by an indefinite prayer instead of a definite answer. But he could not leave the subject precisely there, and so he proceeded to implore mercy of the minority, as follows:
'How trying to Southern men to hear the question, Is not the law of God obliterated before slavery? My respected friends at the North, banish such sentiments. We want to know no north nor south, east nor west, but our whole country; and when you rejoice before God, we are thankful. The tidings of the outpouring of God's spirit upon you have warmed our hearts with gratitude. We rejoice in your increase, numerically or otherwise. You are partners with us in this great and glorious Republic; we want you and all your institutions to prosper. Only feel the same towards us. We have evils and difficulties; you have the same in your cities, in your manufacturing institutions. Are there no vices there? We do not rebuke you for them. You do the best you can to prevent them. Bear with us in like manner, and believe that we at the South are trying to instruct the poor ignorant negroes to the best of our power, and ameliorate the laws which bear upon their condition.'
To this Dr. Johns added, near the close of his speech-'The evil of slavery is upon us, and we must do the best we can with it.' But, after returning to Baltimore, he found that, in the confusion of mind produced by such home questions, he had conceded more than his slaveholding constituents would allow. He therefore published in the newspapers of that city his retraction of this last expression, declaring that, instead of saying 'The evil of slavery is upon us'-as if slavery itself were an evil-he meant to have said, 'The evils of slavery are upon us,' meaning by 'evils,' no doubt, the same excrescences, or a portion of them, to which the Tract Society at Boston refer in their periphrastic expression about ' those moral evils and vices which it [the else harmless institution of slavery] is known to promote.'
The correspondent of the Traveller closes his account of the death of this pro-slavery minister as follows:
'Allusion was made in several churches of other denominations last Sabbath to his useful life and decease, and the church where the funeral services were held was packed, and hundreds if not thousands went away because they could not get in. His last words were, ' yes, dear Jesus, I come;' as though he heard the Saviour inviting him. And he was ready to go and render up his account with joy.'
So grossly have the American-people been misled by the clergy and the churches, in regard to the discrimination of those ' fruits ' which indicate (or contraindicate) a Christian character, that the great majority, even of New England men and women, would assume Dr. Johns to have led a Christian life on the strength of such evidence as is presented above. His priesthood in the Episcopal church-a church so utterly heartless and inhuman in this country as not even to show a minority against slavery, not even to have advanced from absolute indifference to discussion upon that subject-his support of the American Tract Society, his activity in those prayer-meetings which made converts of slaveholders, slave-traders and slave-breeders, without in the slightest degree interfering with those occupations, and his familiar use of the dialect of piety-these would generally be considered sufficient evidence of his Christian character; and this evidence (what a perversion of language and of meaning to call it such!) is not considered to suffer the slightest abatement or modification from the fact that Dr. Johns had all his life been an active supporter of slavery; that he had all his life seen that very Jesus, whose name he impiously took on his dying lips, robbed, wounded, beaten, while he, priest like, passed by on the other side; that he had all his life seen Him an hungered, athirst, naked, sick, chained and imprisoned, and did not minister unto Him.
'He did it unto one of His,
He did it unto Him!'
If the late Philip Barton Key, just before the shameful death which terminated his shameful earthly life, had gravely uttered the words, 'Yes, dear Jesus, I come,'-as though he heard the Saviour inviting him- the impudent hypocrisy would have shocked everybody, and would have deceived nobody. The pretension involved in these words would have been seen to be monstrous as well as false, in view alike of his general character and of the adulterous connection which symmetrically closed his career. But when Dr. Johns uses these words-at the close of a life spent in supporting a system of gross and stupendous iniquity in which hundreds of thousands of adulteries yearly are only one item-and shortly after taking pains to register his public, testimony that this system of iniquity, far from being a sin, is not even ' an evil' -the religious press gilds him with it choicest eulogies, the obsequious reporter for the daily paper takes for granted that this pro-slavery priest has really received a special invitation from Him who came 'to preach deliverance to the captives, to set at liberty
<c05>
them that are bruised, and the public acquiesce in this monstrous perversion of the whole character and meaning, the whole work and aim of Christianity.
The sympathy of the church is with Dr. Johns, the American Tract Society, and the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Let us look at another scene, which displays her antipathy.
Two pamphlets, lie before us, with the following titles:
'Proceedings of the Trial of Stephen Brewer, before the Presbyterian Church of Cortland Village, March 14th and 15th 1859.' pp. 24.
'Christian Liberty vs Ecclesiastical Despotism: A Sermon, preached in the Stone Church in Cortland, N. Y., April 3d, 1859: By William H. Fish, Minister of the Society.' pp. 7.
This sermon, preached by the minister of a free, and truly reformatory, progressive and Christian church, is a manly and judicious defence of the rights invaded in the person of Mr. Brewer, and an exposure of the injustice of his trial, recorded in the pamphlet first mentioned. An extract from the sermon will be found on our first page. Of the trial we wish now to give a brief account, first quoting from the pamphlet its
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
This pamphlet contains a brief report of a two days' ecclesiastical trial before the authorities of the Presbyterian Church of this village, which is rather curious in its character, but which, we doubt not, will be both interesting and instructive.
The 'STONE CHURCH,' which is the chief 'stone of stumbling and rock of offence' in the matter, is a Free Church in the broadest sense of the term free. Its pulpit is free to all sincere and honest men and women of Christian character and fair ability, who wish to speak in it on any of the great interests of Humanity; and its pews are also equally free-free not only to hear, but to question and criticise, in a respectful and orderly manner, whom they hear-as well as being free on Sundays to all desirous of occupying them 'without money and without price.'
Now, this 'Free Church' has been opened for three winters past to Courses of Lectures given before the 'Coralville Literary Association,' by such representative and distinguished men as Wendell Phillips, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Horace Greeley, Joshua R. Giddings, William Lloyd Garrison, E. H. Chapin, T Starr King, A. D. Mayo, George W. Curtis and others; and as several of them have lectured on Saturday evenings, they have 'preached ' for the 'Stone Church' Society, each in his own way, on Sundays. Of course such men generally drew full houses, many coming from several miles distant-some twenty miles-to hear them; and a few of the members of the Presbyterian Church attended some of these discourses. Prominent among the latter was the victim of this trial-Mr. Stephen Brewer, who has seemed to understand his rights and to possess a disposition to maintain them. He is, as all the citizens of Cortland Village know, an intelligent and most worthy man, and second to no one in this respect in the church in which he was, for several years, a ruling 'Elder.' But his eyes are set in his forehead, and he seems interested, therefore, to know what is coming, as well as what has gone, and has availed himself of the rare opportunity of listening to some of the most distinguished heralds of the future that have visited us
He has 'devoutly and steadily,' with few exceptions, attended his own church as the 'Covenant' requires, seldom if ever leaving more than half a day, to hear even the greatest and best man. We believe he has never, on such occasions, left either the communion service or his class in Sunday School-charitably (and some have thought too charitably)-upholding a church ' understood to be exceedingly pro-slavery.'
But Mr. Brewer's general fidelity to the church was not enough for the 'Elders.' They insisted that Mr. B. should give up even an occasional attendance upon the ministration of such men on the Sabbath. The 'Elders' had several interviews with Mr. B. upon this subject; how these brethren were received and treatï¿½ed- with what courtesy and kindness-will be learned from the minutes of the trial.
Mr. B. not feeling it to be his duty to submit to this (what seemed to him) unreasonable demand of his brethren, was therefore cited to appear before the church authorities and answer to the charge of 'Covenant-breaking and Sabbath desecration'-the Sabbath-breaking consisting in hearing Wendell Phillips, and others, speak on the Sabbath day upon 'secular and unchristian' subjects! This curious charge and the specifications under it, appear in another place. But soon after the trial came on, the charge of 'Sabbath-desecration' was dropped! Whether this was to avoid the necessity of meeting various witnesses whose testimony it would not be easy to dispose of to the satisfaction of the  prosecution, or whether it was to escape from a position that seemed simply ludicrous to nine tenths of the community, who are governed by common sense, we do not know; but it is conjectured that it must have been one or the other. Mr. Brewer was certainly quite willing to meet the charge, and asked no mercy. It was the 'Elders' right, however, to recede from so precipitate a step; and we only state the fact that they did so.
The trial of an offending member in the Presbyterian church, is always before a body of 'Elders,' called 'The Session,' the Pastor being the Moderator. This 'Session,' during the trial under notice, was called by its highest officer 'The Judicatory of Jesus Christ'; and what its assumed powers are, may be inferred from the following articles found in the 'Confession of Faith,' Chapter 30.
'I. The Lord Jesus Christ, as King and head of his church, hath therein appointed a government in the hand of church officers, distinct from the civil magistrate.
II. To these officers the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven are committed, by virtue whereof they have power respectively to retain and remit sins, to shut that kingdom against the impenitent, both by word and censure, and to open it unto penitent sinners, by the ministry of the Gospel and by absolution from censures as occasion shall require.'
It was before this Body that Mr. Brewer appeared on the 14th day of March, 1859, with his friend and brother church member, D. Brainard Nelson, as assistant Counsel, to defend himself against the charge of 'Covenant Breaking.' Hon. Henry Stephens was Counsel for the prosecution.
The court being opened with prayer, it proceeded with its oaths, and in various ways, after a two days' trial, was enabled to elicit the facts, with illustrations, that appear in the following Report.
After the trial 'The Session' adjourned for three days and invited Mr. Brewer to meet them at their appointed time and hear their decision; but when they came together they did not agree upon a decision. At their adjourned sitting, however, which was on Friday, March 25th, they came to the decision to suspend Mr. Brewer from the Sacraments of the Church until he repents, or the Session see fit to take further action in the case.

PROCEEDINGS AT THE TRIAL.
This cause came on for trial before the Session at the Session Room of the Presbyterian Church, on Monday, March 14th, 1859.
The Session is composed of the following members, viz: Henry Stephens, Simeon Lucas, William Elder, Charles Kingsbury, S. M. Roe, Leonard Foster, Franklin Blodgett and David Fisk. Rev. O. H. Seymour, as Pastor of the Church, and by virtue of his office a member of the Session and Moderator.
At 2 o'clock P. M., the Session was called to order, and opened with prayer by the Moderator, who delivered a brief charge to the Session, as is customary when entering upon business of this kind.
The minutes of the last session were read, and Mr. Brewer requested [leave] to make a statement in explanation of the minutes as they appeared, and to show that the matters which were in his favor had not been recorded; which request was denied, the counsel for the prosecution objecting.
The charges against the Defendant were embodied in the citation, together with the specifications, which were as follows:-
CORTLANDVILLE, Feb. 10, 1859.

Witnesses.-Elder Charles Kingsbury, Elder <illegible> Lucas, Your conversation with Session Jan <illegible> 1859.
By order of the Session.
O. H. SEYMOUR, Moderator.
Having given, from the pamphlet, these statements respecting the character of Mr. Brewer, and the charges against him, with the decision of the <illegible> thereupon, we wish further to quote, briefly, some features of the manner of conducting this trial.
Mr. D. B. Nelson now briefly opened the cause on the part of the accused. He thought a case had not been made out; that all the evidence proved <illegible> that the accused had absented himself occassionally from the Sabbath service of the Church and that this cannot be made a breach of Covenant; for all the members are chargeable with an occasional absence.
Henry Stephens, sworn as witness for the accused.
The Counsel for the Session asks what the accured intends to prove by this witness.
The accused replies that he offers to prove that he, the accused, has been a steady and devout attendent upon all the ordinances and institutions of the church ever since he became a member of said Church.
The Counsel for the Session objects to this testimony on the ground that the accused does not propose to disprove the specifications alleged and proved under the first charge.
The accused here claimed that this action was <illegible> breaking his covenant, and not for going to the Universalist church.
The counsel for the session said Mr. B. could not be allowed to prove that he had attended his own church as regularly as other members, nor that other members had attended the Stone Church. They had not been talked to on the subject as Mr. B. had. The accused could not be allowed to show that he <illegible> a good character, for the offence would be greater by the defendant's proving that he sustained a good moral character.
The accused here asked if he was to be cut off from introducing his evidence.? We offer to show that the defendant has performed all his duties and kept all the covenants, by good and substantial witnesses, We claim that it is unjust to shut us out from our defence altogether.
The Moderator called Mr. B. to order, and told him he must not say anything more on the subject as it would only aggravate the case.'
The accused, at successive periods of the trial, offered to prove, by incontrovertible testimony, the folï¿½lowing things:
That he had been a steady and devout attendant upon all the ordinances and institutions of the church, as required by that clause of the covenant which he is accused of having violated:
That the discourses which he is accused of attending were proper for the Sabbath, and that the meetings were orderly and respectful.
That such amount of absence from his own church as was charged upon him was not 'covenant-breaking,' and was not commonly understood to amount to that offence.
In all these cases, the counsel for the Session objected to the reception of the evidence offered, and the Moderator sustained the objection; and when one of the witnesses testified that the defendant urged conscientious motives for his refusal to promise a discontinuance of his occasional attendance at 'the Store Church,' the counsel for the session remarked that the most alarming feature of the case is that the defendant is conscientious in going there!
Finally, the sessions of this iniquitous court <illegible> those meetings of the church-members of Park St. church in this city, at which the banishment of colored people from equal participation in their Sunday worship was debated and decided) were opened and closed with prayer!
Here we see a specimen of the antipathy of the church which boasts itself 'evangelical.'
Occasional absences from church on Sunday are a matter of course, with the majority of church-members. If the cause of such absence may fairly be presumed to be sleepiness, or a shower of rain, no complaint is made, no censure excited; the very <illegible> that can befal the absentee is to lose the honor and glory of being reputed the most assiduous and <illegible> among his brethren. But if the same amount of absence be occasioned, not by laziness, but by as perception of the fact that better spiritual food is, at that particular time, to be obtained elsewhere-especially if instruction be sought of those who apply the prospects of Jesus to actual life more faithfully than the self-styled 'evangelicals'-and most especially if the reformatory preacher in question be one who pleads the cause of 'the very least' of the brethren of Jesus, the despised and oppressed black man-censure, calumny, a trial conducted in a grossly unjust manner, and suspension from church-membership are the result!
Such are the sympathies and such the <illegible> of the church. She loves and eulogizes Dr. Johes; she detests and persecutes Mr. Brewer. The conformity of Dr. Johns to the opinions and customs of the church (including its erroneous opinions and its various customs)-and his arrogant pretence of familiarity and sympathetic alliance with that Jesus to whom his last words were addressed-are the reasons for which the church favored him; and she favors him none the less for the fact that those last words, instead of expressing the penitence which his evil life demanded, contained an impudent assumption that Jesus <illegible> that life, and would welcome on high with <illegible> one whose earthly course stands in such intense and emphatic contrast with that which He led on earth On the other hand, the resemblances between the <illegible> life of that same Jesus and of Mr. Brewer are the reasons why the latter is stigmatized and persecuted by the church. His freedom of mind, venturing to believe what seemed to him true, and his freedom of action, venturing to live in accordance with such belief, even when both were frowned upon by a respectable conservatism which also claimed a monopoly of piety -and his application of this freedom of thought and action to the help of the poor and needy instead of to his own gain or popularity-though exactly in accordance with what Jesus did in Nazareth and Jerusalem, were the very reasons for which Mr. Brewer was brought to trial before the Presbyterian Sessions.
Still, even in such a relic of the dark ages as this ecclesiastical trial, we find signs of progress. Progress may be real, however unwilling; the wheelbarrow advances not less really than the locomotive On watching, throughout this trial, the position of the Reverend O. H. Seymour, Moderator of 'the Judicatory of Jesus Christ,' and ex officio holder of the keys of the kingdom of heaven, who can fail to be reï¿½minded of Bunyan's representations of the <illegible> giants,' Pope and Pagan,' whose impotents threats could not obstruct the progress of the Christian Pilgrim! Who can fail to see that such <illegible> are losing  their power over the public which every fresh instance of the attempt to enforce them.!
Again, it is highly significant that the charge of Sabbath-breaking was dropped before the accused had an opportunity of replying to it, and of showing from the Bible, as he undoubtedly could do, that neither the doctrine nor the practice of Sabbatical observance by Christians finds the slightest support in that book.
Every event which, like this trial, drags the church into the light-shows the hollowness of her <illegible> monious pretensions, and displays the contrast between what Christianity really is and what she represents it to be-will, by one act, advance the triumph of true freedom and true religion; will help to emancipation souls as well as bodies, and to establish 'the liberty with which Christ makes free,' in every department of human welfare.-c. k. w.

NEW PUBLICATIONS.
Anti-Slavery Tactics: a paper read before the Members of the Leeds Young Men's Anti-Slavery Society, March 16th, 1859. By Joseph A. Horner.' pp.24. London, 1859.
In the anti-slavery work, plan and method are important, hardly less than assiduity and vigor. Mr. Horner seeks to inculcate all these upon his coadjutors, and he does the work ably and judiciously. It is indeed true, as he says, that British friends of the immediate and unconditional abolition of slavery, may use their means of helping the cause even more effectively by judicious labor at home, than by sending money to sustain its instrumentalities here. And it is also true, as he says, that no labor is more productive in this vineyard than that which removes its obstacles, of foremost among which is the alliance of the American Church with slavery.
The pamphlet tells us (p. 12) that- At present pro-slavery bishops and slave-holding ministers of religion visiting this country, are welcomed to our churches and chapels, and on their return to America boast of their reception. ' Mr. Horner proposes that such persons shall receive a reception in England which they will no longer be disposed to boast of; that when they make any prominent appearance before the British public, an account shall be demanded of them respecting their position in regard to slavery at home; and that, if facts show their course at home to have been either openly or tacitly pro-slavery, information of this shall be laid before the public at large, and also before their particular circle of ecclesiastical connections.
This plan seems to us a highly judicious one; and it is made eminently so by the fine gradations to which complicity with slavery is now getting reduced. The (National) American Tract Society is openly pro-slavery, refusing to recognize slave-holding either in the list of sins or of evils. The principal branch of this Society, at Boston, vehem ently insists that it is not anti-slavery, but yet recognizes slavery as tending to promote some evils, which evils it therefore proposes fraternally to discuss, though it will not go the length of opposing even them! And now a new Society, which is anti-slavery both in name and constitution, ('The Church Anti-Slavery Society of the United States,') votes to confer with the preceding one in regard to the publication of tracts-as if tracts published by Radicalism,. Compromise & Co. could be worth anybody's reading! As if genuine radicalism could ask or wish for co-operation from compromise!
Mr. Horner seems to have been rather hasty in his conclusion that the Young Men's Christian Association' of New York now occupies right ground upon the subject of slavery. This institution is a true child of the church. It has branches in nearly every slaveholding State, but the Northern branches have not yet uttered the first word of remonstrance to the Southern ones upon the subject. They all hold the position practically taught by their mother, namely, that piety is not in the slightest degree prejudiced, or rendered suspicious, still less contra-indicated by slaveholding.-C. K. W.

ESSES COUNTY ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY. 
The Essex County Anti-Slavery Society held a quarterly meeting in West Newbury, on Sunday, the first day of May, commencing at 10 o'clock. The President, Mr.., Remond, called the meeting to order, and made some appropriate remarks.
Mr. Parker Pillsbury then addressed the meeting at some length, with his usual ability.
Joseph Merrill, of Danvers, made some remarks suited to the occasion. 
Thomas S. Chipman, of West Newbury, also made some remarks. 
Committees on business and finance were appointed, and Mr. Pillsbury again made some remarks, and the meeting adjourned until 2 o'clock, P. M.
AFTERNOON SESSION. Met agreeably to adjournment. The President made some introductory remarks.
William Wells Brown then addressed the meeting at some length, and made a humorous and interesting speech, which put the audience in good condition for contribution, which occasion was improved to good effect.
Mr. Pillsbury, chairman of the Business Committee, reported a series of resolutions which were adopted by the meeting. Mr. Pillsbury then made a speech of great power and ability.

Adjourned to meet again at 7 o'clock in the evening.
ENENING SESSION. The President having called the meeting to order, Mr. Brown reported the following resolution.
Resolved, That in the death of Charles F. Hovey, this Society has lost a valuable member, and the Anti-Slavery cause a devoted friend, and that we tender our sympathy to his afflicted family.
The audience was addressed during the evening by Mr. Remond and Mr. Brown to very good acceptance. These meetings were well attended during the day and evening by attentive audiences, and some twelve dollars were contributed for the cause.
MOSES WRIGHT, Secretary. 
1. Resolved., That the full and faithful proclamation of the whole truth of God, with regard to American slavery, is the imperative duty of every friend of freedom, and was never more a duty than it is at this day; that all compromise and temporizing should be shunned, as full of peril to the people and to the cause of liberty; and that no present, partial and temporary success should be sought at the expense of that vital truth and thorough principle by which alone the right can ever become victorious over the wrong.
2. Resolved, That to the demand of the slaveholders, that slave-holding and slave-hunting shall be extended over the whole country, and that the African Slave Trade shall be again instituted, we will oppose the sentiment that slavery and all slave trading shall cease at once and forever., in this land and in all lands; and we shall hail joyfully the riddance of this country from so foul a crime and curse, come by what agency or instrumentality it may.
3. Resolved, That in the constantly occurring instances of Northern and even Republican States and Territories refusing to extend to the colored population the rights of suffrage and of citizenship, and of the general ignoring of that people altogether in such localities, except to oppress them, we see the most conclusive, as well as alarming evidence, that the slaves of the South have nothing to hope, but everything to dread, from the triumph of any political party now in existence.
4. Resolved, That the almost abortive attempt to organize religious, or church and clerical body to act against slavery in New England and New York, has demonstrated that the religion of the country is as rotten as the government, the church as heartless as the State, and the priesthood as compromising and corrupt as the politicians; and that those only can act effectively against slavery, who can tread them all under foot, and stand for truth, justice, and humanity, against all the machinations of the slaveholder, and his governmental and ecclesiastical accomplices.
5. Resolved, That whatever argument can be presented in favor of the American struggle for freedom, with its Lexington and Bunker Hill battles, can be urged with equal force for an insurrectionary struggle among the slaves; and whoever should assist them with arms and ammunition, or a personal participation in its bloody scenes, would deserve as much greater praise than Lafayette for fighting by the side of Washington, as is the oppression of the slave
<c02>
worse than that endured by our Revolutionary Fathers.
6. Resolved, That whether the Fugitive Slave Law be constitutional or otherwise, whether it be neutralized by a Personal Liberty Law' in our own Commonwealth or not, we pronounce it an audacious outrage on all human nature and the government of God, and come war or come peace, come life or come death, it shall never be executed on any spot where! the influence of our voice or right arm can prevent it.

HENRY C. WRIGHT IN MAINE. 
ELLSWORTH, (Me.) May 3, 1859. 
DEAR GARRISON:
For the past week, we have been having the labors of this untiring, earnest and zealous worker in the cause of Human Rights amongst us. The soil of error and superstition has been well broken up, and been made to show all its hideousness and deformity. Its occupants have quaked with fear before the blows of this merciless destroyer of its false peace. He gave us ten lectures on various subjects, all reformatory, and in none did he fail to endeavor to work us up to a realization of our duty to the slave. In his lecture on The Drad Past and the Living Present,' how faithfully did he portray the great crime of ministers and churches, who, while they were deaf to the cries of four millions of slaves, chained, whipped and scourged, bartered and sold like beasts; while they were blind to the present degradation caused by the demons War and Intemperance; and insensible to starving, sin-sick and suffering souls right around us; persisted in carrying us back two thousand years, and portraying to our view the dreadful sufferings of Christ on the cross, and exhorting us to love, pity, reverence, and sympathize with this bleeding Savior.' And thus we are made keenly alive and sensitive to the suffering which was endured in the dead past'; but, Oh! how reckless, careless and indifferent to the cry of woe which reaches us from the living present'! Would that this subject could be brought before every man, woman and child in this nation, until all could see the utter uselessness of all this waste of sympathy with one whose trials ended long ago; and then, perhaps, we might be induced to open our ears a little wider to the wails of anguish coming from, those around us.
And yet, because Henry C. Wright would thus open our eyes and ears to present wants and present suffering, because he would point us to a savior in the living human being around us, the Church sets up a horrible howl, and raises its old worn-out cry of blasphemy and infidelity!'
Shall the anti-slavery men and women of Ells worth, or any where else, be daunted or dismayed by the faint yelping of these poor sectarian priests, and their superstitious and credulous followers, as they tremble and quake before the timely and effective blows wielded by Henry C. Wright upon the old superstitions and creeds of their reverenced dead past? No-let our every word and deed show the contempt we feel for their anxiety. But there is a higher and holier work for us to do than merely showing our contempt for the howls of sectarianism.
The past week we have met and been instructed. We have talked of the lectures we have heard, have told of our enjoyment, and renewed faith, and the like. And now should we not earnestly endeavor to embody the principles of Anti-Slavery in our daily walk and conversation? Let us see to it, then, that not one of us can be found in religious or political fellowship with the monster slavery, and that we sound anew the battle-cry of No Union with Slaveholders!' And while we adopt the religious principles which have been placed before us the past week, may we feel that we must get rid of all this false reverence for the dead past, and be ever ready to hear the cries of suffering humanity around us now; and see that by life we are true to the ideas which we so zealously defend by word. And when Henry C. Wright, or any one else, shall come again to speak to us concerning these things, shall we not be able to show the seed that has now been planted, all germinated, and pervading every thought and deed, and making us true to ourselves, to God, and to suffering humanity everywhere? H. L. C.
The following is additional testimony to the untiring labors of this robust reformer in Ellsworth:

FRIEND GARRISON:
Notwithstanding the Liberator is filled with much better matter than I can give you, yet I feel that it will not be altogether uninteresting to your readers to learn, that progressive thought and individual independence are making their impress away down East,' as well as in the Cradle of Liberty,' or in the mighty upheavals of a gigantic and freedom-loving West.
Henry C. Wright has been with us, by invitation, two Sundays, and, in all, spoken to us publicly eleven times, to large audiences, considering the circumstances that surrounded his meetings. His theme, throughout, was Man, under several heads, such as Fact and Fiction in Religion,' Immortality, The Philosophy of Reform,' the Dead Past and the Living Present'; which were all delivered in his masterly, argumentative yet persuasive manner-tearing down the dead forms and ceremonies, whether found in Moses or Jesus, Mahomet or Luther, Calvin or Wesley, Washington or Webster, Beecher or the Church; leaving you nothing to stand upon but your; own naked individual sovereignty; making man superior to every thing else, a complete and most perfect representation of the Deity. Thus much for what he thought and proved, summed up in this beautiful axiom, that Man's demands are only God's commands.'
But we will now proceed to consider some of the circumstances which surrounded Mr. Wright's lectures. For the last two or three months, the priests, of whom we have three in this place, have been laboring day and night, mornings and evenings, to save the people from a future hell, and secure for them a future heaven, resulting in frightening the young and female portion of their hearers into the acceptance of their dogmas; but as it began to be certain that Henry C. Wright would be here, the priests began to fear for their lambs, warning them to keep away from his lectures; and the -Methodist minister actually staid away from the Methodist General Conference, for what object, each one infers for himself; and, to complete the array against his lectures, Prof. Grimes, of notorious bombast and duplicity, was solicited to come here by encouragement from the Church, to put down Spiritualism, etc. With such an array of priests and charlatans the progressives were obliged to contend, the minister giving up his hall to this mountebank, and advising his people to go and hear him for themselves; and, to complete the arrangement, they secured his services for them one evening free of all charge at the door, actually suspending their several meetings to chase after Grimes. But, as his lectures proceeded, they discovered that he was proving too much, eliciting the very inquiry and investigation which they wished to put down. So he left, and they are mum.
Our lectures were going on at the same time across the street, winding up Sunday evening, May 1st, to a crowded hall. The seed of True Reform has been sowed, which shall in due time spring up and bear fruit to the healing of the people.
Friend Garrison, I have often thought that Maine can be made good anti-slavery ground. Why will not such apostles of reform as Pillsbury, Hey wood, Foster, Foss and yourself, break to us the true bread of salvation from negro slavery? We ought, at the next session of the Legislature, to make Maine a free State, and it cannot be done unless the people are enlightened upon its importance.

PROF. LESTER-DEMOCRACY-SPIRITUALISM.
FRIEND GARRISON:
Permit me to occupy a corner of your paper with a few remarks on: an article which I have just discovered in a Spiritual Telegraph. of some months since, It is an article headed Literary Notice,' by J. A. Weisse, M., D. I am a Spiritualist, but have no apol­ogy to offer for the admission of such an article into a Spiritualist paper.
The object of the article was to puff C. E. Lester, and advertise his connection with the Democratis Age. The article is careful to inform us that Mr. Lester is grandson of Jonathan Edwards. Possibly this may be the case. Jonathan Edwards once said, Reprobate infants are vipers of vengeance, which Jehovah will hold over hell in the tongs of his wrath until they turn and spit venom in his face.' I once heard C. E. Lester say from the pulpit, that God sent some sinners to hell to let them see what splendid damnation he could give them. There is here something of a family resemblance.
Yes, Mr. Lester has represented us abroad in an inferior capacity; and he has figured a trifle in the literary world, but I happen to know too much of his antecedents as a reformer to have my head turned by our M. D.'s representations.
The moneyed object of this politico-literary notice would seem to have been to blow a little on the old Democratic horn, while fishing for patronage for Mr. Lester-thus killing two birds with one stone.' Surely, such blowing and angling are worthy the talents of a genius. 
Mr. Weisse swells out largely in a glorification of the Democratic party. Great is Diana of the Ephesians! And up goes his hat, in true boyish ecstasy. But Mr. Weisse's talent for the ludicrous fairly culmi­nates in such choice and sensible expressions as these: The Democratic party seems the only one capable of ruling this country. Without it, the Union would drop to pieces in the midst of strife and civil war. The Democratic party has always proclaimed Universal Emancipation, Universal Freedom.'
This appeal to our risibles is quite irresistible. Such remarks may serve very well to amuse, but should not provoke serious criticism. Such assevera­tions, in the face of past events, prove quite conclu­sively, that in Mr. Weisse there is ample material for a South-Side' Adams, but none for a philosopher. The Democratic party the conservator of republican freedom!!
Such stereotyped cant of antiquated partyism; in other words, this offensive or mephitic effervescence of antiquated ignorance, has about lost its power for evil. The Democratic party at the North already ex­ists as a mere excrescence of slavery. The little vi­tality it possesses is absorbed from this infernal sys­tem; a system at once the most perfect reflex of man's perverted nature, and aptly set forth in the ex­pression, the sum of all villanies.'
The Democratic party and the Slave Power at the North have been one and inseparable. The one has been the adjunct of the other. Together they stand, together they full. They have lived together, and they must die together. And it will require a louder trump than Gabriel's to awake them to a resurrection. 
All other parties, says Mr. Weisse, have fallen to pieces. And this is his argument, that the Democrat­ic party is really the conservator of republican freedom! Let me give you a suggestion, Mr. Weisse. Your Democratic party is the receptacle of all the old fogyism, dishonesty and ignorance in the political arena. It is the Dead Sea of the political world, combining none of the elements of progression. Other parties have not existed without a soul, without more or less of the vital principle of progression. If other parties have lacked the element of cohesion, it was simply because of the antagonism created by one por­tion falling back from the principle of progression, and seeking, covertly, perhaps, to assimilate itself with a party that has ever held together by its sworn subserviency to the Slave Power.
Mr. Weisse has condensed a good deal of fulsome flattery of Mr. Lester as an author, and then winds up his profuse expressions of adulation by introducing an article from the Democratic Age. And this is one of his articles that evince so much statesmanship.' Mr. Weisse does little credit to his own head in set­ting up Mr. Lester as his beau ideal of a statesman.
In the article given, Mr. Lester affirms, that in the present war of opinions,  the mass of mankind know not why they are still struggling, nor for what.' Surely, such discernment as this is worthy of a statesman.! The mass of mankind, continues this gifted author, are like beasts in pain; they vent their rage on the first that approaches.'
And then the author of The Glory and Shame of England' goes on to intimate that he has found the bone of all this contention-that in his exercise of his mighty powers of comprehension he shall be able to enlighten the poor blind and enraged creatures of this country respecting the real cause of their agitation!
Poor Mr. Lester! that he should set himself up as a philosopher! He may excel in lighter literature, but if nature intended him for a philosopher, for a profound thinker, she has abundant reason to be ashamed of her handiwork.
Very truly yours,
April 22, 1859.

The graceful and artless movements of the little creatures were perfectly charming. Their voices indeed, in such a vast area, were weak and piping; but their dancing, for grace and agility, was admirable. Waving the grave question of the possible effect of their being thus exhibited, upon their future welfare,-we know not when we have witnessed any thing more gratifying.

SAD DETAILS OF THE ST. NICHOLAS DISASTER.
The explosion of the steamer St. Nicholas on the 24th of April, in the vicinity of Memphis, was one of the most terrific that has occurred for years on the Mississippi. It took place at 10 o'clock Sunday eve­ning, all four of the great boilers exploding at once when the boat was under full headway. About sixty lives were lost, and the boat, with a large and valuable cargo, entirely destroyed. The wreck at once took fire, and soon enwrapped the whole boat in one sheet of flame. The picture revealed by the lurid flames was barrowing in the extreme.
Capt. Me Mullen was caught in some burning tim­bers. The mate says-
'While endeavoring to release the captain one of the striker engineers came to our assistance, but the three of us failed to extricate him from his awful posi­tion. The flames were rapidly encroaching upon our territory, and the heat was becoming intolerable. Capt. McMullen begged us to cut his leg off., but we could find no axe or other instrument by which to do so, else we would have complied with his wish. We worked at the captain until the fire drove us away- he begging us all the time to remain by him. We did not leave him until the moment arrived when to re­main any longer would have been certain death to all of us without the possibility of relieving the captain. He was consumed by the flames almost before our eyes. The last words he uttered were,  My God! I shall have to burn up.' When he saw that he would have to burn he ceased his entreaties for us to remain by him, and bade us seek our own safety.'
The Republican says the captain leaves behind him a young wife and infant. They had been united in the bonds of matrimony just two years to a day on the first reception of the sad intelligence. His wife had entertained hopes until the intelligence brought to her by the survivors no longer left any doubt that her husband was no more. Her grief is said to be incon­solable, indeed, and she continually exclaims in the midst of her frantic bereavement-' Oh! I shall ever hear him crying for help! help!'
The cook, James Wood, was caught between the boat's hull and wheel, and it was supposed that he was fixed there until his head was burnt off. His brother was in a yawl, and spoke to him, but could afford no succor. Several persons say they heard him speaking and asking for assistance, but none could he be given. His brother called out, Is that you, Jim?' and was answered, Yes!' upon which he exclaim­ed, in agonizing tones, s O, God! O, God! that is my brother, and I cannot see nor help him.'
Mr. Rives, a man of high reputation, made a speech at Richmond, on Tuesday evening, in which he took the ground that the North was ready to acquiesce in the Dred Scott decision, and to enter upon a war against the administration that should be directed against democratic corruptions, while nothing should be said about slavery! This ineffable trash he put forth because he had been told at the North that it was the right thing! Told by whom? By a few crazy fellows who disgrace the old whig name by pre­tending to be whigs, but who know nothing about public sentiment here at this time. The North dis­likes the corruptions of the administration, but it dis­likes the slave power much more, and it means to continue the war against that power, of which the democratic party is merely the miserable tool. Mr. Rives would do well to go among the Northern people, the next time he shall come North, if he is really desirous of proving what is the condition of opinion here. The policy he recommends would keep the democratic party, corrupt as it is, in power, forever.-Traveler.
There have been fugitive slave troubles at Zanesville, the alleged fugitive having been seized and carried off, after he had been legally released. Thus, while the South refuses to punish men clearly guilty of having been engaged in the African slave trade, she can send into free States, and take away men pre­sumptively free. In other countries, generous senti­ments occasionally render men violent; here violence and wrong are almost invariably united, erroneous action being prompted by the worst sentiment that can actuate man.
 John S. Holland, of Pembroke, Christian Co., Ky., offers a reward of $150 for the capture and re­turn to him of Thomas Whitlock, a Methodist preach­er, 28 years old, <illegible> weighing 170 or 180 pounds. If caught in a free States the reward is but $ 100. Has anybody seen n a Christian<illegible> loose in their vicin­ity, of about this age and <illegible> If so, here is a chance for speculation, by sending him back to his old Kentucky home.'-Anti-Slavery Bugle.
WORCESTER.-An Anti-Slavery meeting will be held at Worcester, probably at Washburn Hall, on Sunday next, May 15th. STEPHEN S FOSTER is ex­pected to attend, and all friends of freedom, in Wor­cester and vicinity, are invited to be present.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE, VIGILANCE ASSOCIATION.
MONEY. NEEDED, AND AID SOLICITED.
In September, 1850, the Executive Committee ad­dressed a circular to the churches and religious so­cieties of New England, and also made application to many individuals, soliciting contributions to create a fund for rendering pecuniary assistance to such fugitive slaves as reached the Northern States in a des­titute condition. These unfortunate men and women all needed food, clothing: and shelter; moreover, they all needed protection, since in every part of New Eng­land, the law (as administered by the courts) was their enemy, and many individuals in every, town were known to be mean and base enough to co-operate with such a law; some of these fugitives also needed med­ical aid and careful nursing; and, almost all of them needed the means of transportation to a safer place than New England.
The amount thus raised from all these sources was $5028, and this sum has been expended for the relief of fugitives, some in one, some in another, and some in all the above-mentioned departments. The result to be reported to the public is, that more than four hundred fugitives have been aided by their beneficence, and that the Treasurer's purse is now empty.
Those who wish to help these poorest of the poor with money or aid of any other sort, are requested immediately to communicate with the Treasurer or some member of the Finance Committee.

PENNSYLVANIA YEARLY MEETING
OF
PROGRESSIVE FRIENDS.
THE SEVENTH PENNSYLVANIA YEARLY MEETING OF PROGRESSIVE FRIENDS will assemble at LONGWOOD, (near Hamorton) Chester County, on FIRST DAY, the 29th of Fifth month, 1859, at 10 o'clock, A. M., and continue its sessions three or four days.
The friends of Truth, Purity and Progress, of every shade of theological opinion, are earnestly invited to participate in the proceedings of a Religious Society which sets forth no creed, imposes no fetters upon the intellect, encourages the utmost freedom of speech
 and inquiry, and labors, according to its best light, to inspire and diffuse that love of God whose fruits are seen in love to mankind, in efforts to enlighten, elevate and ennoble Humanity, to reclaim the fallen, to break the chains of the slaves, to promote these principles of peace and universal brotherhood which are so beautifully illustrated in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, to search out and remove the causes of human suffering, and to carry the principles of pure and undefiled religion into every relation of life and every institution of society. The object of our assemblies is not to build up a sect, or to afford opportunity for the discussion of abstract points of doctrine, but to edify one another in love, to devise and execute measures of practical reform, and to cultivate those religious faculties and aspirations through which we are consciously allied to the beneficent Author of our being, and by which we receive the blessed assurance of immortal life. We therefore invite the presence and aid of all those, however named or nameless, who, while earnestly wishing to avoid the spirit | of sectarianism, yet feel the need of religious association, and wish to share the privileges and joys of spiritual communion and fellowship one with another.

FROM THE PREFACE.
In this volume alone, of all American anti-Slavery or other Books, the Bondman has been enabled, in his own language, (if I may employ a familiar phrase of political essayists and orators,) to define his position on the all- engrossing topic of the day. Almost every body has done it. Why. then, should not he? Surely he has some.Interest In it, even if it be subject to the constitution; even it his interest in unfortunately in conflict with the sacred compromises of the Federal Compact.
From H. R. HELPER, Esq author of The Impending Crisis of the South.
In The Roving Editor' Redpath has given us a very vigorous and correct sketch of society in the Slave States. On every page of the book is unmistakable evidence that the author was not content with a superficial view of Human Slavery, but that be has penetrated its very heart, and unfolded in an exceedingly interesting and graphic manner, the terrible mysteries of its wicked and desolating functions.

MEDICAL REFORM.
That a great change has within a few years been wrought in the practice of medicine, no one will pretend to deny. It is well known that the study and learning which has been for ages lavished upon the use of mineral poisons, as medicines, have failed to answer the reasonable expectations of the public. The old physicians have abandoned the use of the lancet, and have found it necessary to reduce the quantity of medicine gives to perhaps one-fifth of their original doses; but, as diminishing the quantity does not improve the quality, such a change can never answer the demands of suffering invalids.
A change was required which should dispense with all poisonous, drugs, and substitute a system of innocent medication, which would harmonize with nature, and remove diseases, without the risk of injury to the constitution. For the accomplish­ment of this object, many talented and learned men have zealously labored, and a great reform has been brought about. Among the champions in this reform, we believe all are willing to yield the palm to Dr. R. Greene, the founder of the Boston Indian Medical Institute.
Dr. Greene, after studying the various systems of medicine, and finding that they had not the basis of nature, turned his attention, to the study of Nature's Laws- - spent several years in travel, and received much useful information from those children of Nature -the red men of the forest, whose habits and system of medical practice he thoroughly investigated, and which has greatly assisted him in the development of a system, having nature for its foundation, and science for its super­structure.
About ten years ago, Dr. Greene located in Bos­ton, when the success of his treatment was brought more fully before the public, and his sphere of use­fulness enlarged. His Allopathic friends viewed his success with a jealous eye, and his practice was animadverted upon in one or two of their medical journals, in no very dignified terms. That he was successful in all ordinary diseases was admitted; but they were slow to believe, that he was able to cure Concert and Scrofulous Humors. To convince them and the public of his success, he published facts in regard to cures of such cases, giving the names and residence of such persona who were willing to have their names used, so that any one could be satisfied of their truthfulness. He also pre­served specimens of cancers as they were removed, that they might be examined by the doctors, or by the public. Several hundreds of these cancers, some of enormous size, soon accumulated, having been put up in glass jars, where they have since remained on exhibition at his rooms, 36 Bromfield Street, Boston, to which the public have free access.
These incontrovertible evidences of success brought out the press in his favor, and drew around him a large number of friends who were interested in the common cause of humanity. The business at the office so increased that it became necessary to relieve Dr. Greene from the details of his practice, in order to make his services available to a larger portion of those applying for treatment. For this purpose, and by the advice and cooperation of influential citizens, an organization was formed under the name of the Boston Indian Medical Institute. Not that the practice was crude like that of the Indian, but based upon the Indian sys­tem, or natural principles, harmonizing with natu­ral laws, and avoiding the use of poisonous drugs. Under this organization the Institution has become the most popular Medical Asylum in the country, where patients are daily received and successfully treated for all the various ills of the human family. But few people have an adequate idea of the extent of business done at this Institution, or the number of cures effected, although nearly all are familiar with the fact of frequent remarkable operations being performed with the most favorable results. Such results are not without their lesson. They speak hope to many sufferers, and the basis of such hope is a firm one, for it rests upon experience, and upon facts.
Consumption has been treated with a success un­expected by the patients and their friends; and the results in numerous cases of Scrofula, liver Com­plaint, Dyspepsia, Heart Disease, Dropsy, Female Complaints., Disease of the Stomach, Bowels, and Kidneys, Rheumatism, and various other diseases, give confidence to those conversant with the fact, that cures are effected at this Institution which have baffled medical skill elsewhere.
Facts like these cannot be resisted, and this prac­tice must necessarily take precedence in the minds of the people.
Many clergymen, editors, and other professional gentlemen, have visited this Institution, and signi­fied their entire approbation of the system of prac­tice, and expressed a desire that the facts connected with this treatment should be made known to the world.
The Institution, whose Card is here appended, is now placed upon a firm basis, and is an honor to the city of Boston, and one to which her citizens can point with pride, in view of the vast amount of relief it has afforded to sufferers throughout the country, and the confidence with which the invalid may look upon the; results of its practice in the future.

HUMORS OF THE HUMAN SYSTEM.
It is well known that the juices of the body are governed by natural laws, such as regulate the vegetable life in the change of seasons.
In winter, they are congealed, or in common par­lance, the sap is down,' the pores are closed, and our whole body is hard and firm, and an accumulation of impurities takes place in our system.
The genial influences of Spring cause an expansion of all living matter, the sap rises in vegetable life, also the juices <illegible>of our bodies are given out and enter into the common circulation.
This is a law to which every human being is sub­ject, and the neglect of it has caused a whole summer of misery.
Now is the time to apply a remedy that cleanses and searches every fibre and pore, and eradicates every particle and sediment of humor that has laid stagnant during the winter.
Kennedy's Medical Discovery is well known to our readers as the greatest and best Blood Purifier the world has ever produced.
We advise each and all of our readers to use one bottle of it this Spring; we say one bottle, for that will cure the impurities of one season, and prepare the system for the changes of the next.
Where the disease has fastened itself and become settled in the system, larger quantities are required.
For Scrofula, Erysipelas, Salt Rheum, Scald Head. White Scales, Shingles, Pushes, Ulcerated Sor<illegible>e Legs, Humor in the Eyes, Running of the Ears from Scarlet Fever or Measles, the Medical Discovery can be relied upon to effect a perfect cure.

THE TWO VOICES
Lines, written upon the Island of <illegible> Cruz.
By <illegible> FRANCES D. GAGE
I stood upon the wave-washed shore,
As the sun sunk beneath the sea,
And said the dashing waters' rear,
A loved voice seemed to speak to me,
'My wife, come home!'
The sea was calm, the sky was clear,
On yonder ship the white <illegible> hung
All idly-while the sailor cheer
Came oer the wave; and still was sung,
'Mother, come home!'
The sun was gone-Night's sable cloak
Soon furled the rustling palms above
My head;-a voice the silence broke,
And soft winds brought the words of love,
Sister, come home!'
Twas glorious, that star-lit sea,
And grand the dashing of the wave,
And every surge brought up to me
Some face or form, as from the grave,
Saying, 'Friend, come home!'
And then I wept; my salt tears fell,
And mingled with the salter sea;
And in my heart a surging swell
Dashed up-a life-time memory
Of loves and home.
I felt that I must stretch my hands
Up to the white sails passing by,
Toward my own dear native land,
And with a home-sick spirit cry,
Oh! take me home!'
And then there came a still, small voice,
But deep as good old ocean's roar,
Asking-Dost thou repent thy choice?
Hear'st thou the suffering cry no more?
Would thou go home?
Nay! let thy hear:-loves nestle still
Cherished and warmed within the breast;
But onward with an earnest will,
And find in duties done thy rest:
Earth is thy home.'
The dark-browd children of the sun
In thy own land still pleading cry
For husband, father, daughter, son,
To the deaf night-winds floating by,
For love and home.'
Their loves are chained by bolts and bars;
Thy countrys laws bread dearest ties;
Sorrow and toil, and stripes and scare,
And maddening wrong, and bitter sighs,
Make wreck of home.
Be brave and strong! and learn the tales
Of Freedom from these ransom'd ones,
To tell again o'er hills and vales,
To proud Columbias recreant sons,
These tales of home.
Be brave and strong!-who knowest but thou
Mayst break some sufferers galling chain,
And lay upon the tortured brow
The light of Liberty again,
Of love and home?

LINES,
Respectfully Dedicated to Rev. Theodore Parker, in Cuba.
BY ANNA GARDNER.
Bright isle of palms! sweet land of flowers!
The ceaseless summer time,
The healthful air and perfumed bowers
Of thy dear southern clime,
To many an invalid hath been
A balm-an untold wealth-
Restoring wasted strength again,
And buoyant, rosy health.
To thee, whose air new life imparts,
A sacred charge is given-
Prayers, rising from ten thousand hearts,
'Besiege the courts of heaven,'
That he who seeks thy genial skies,
To mend life's broken ring,
May feel thy grateful air arise,
With healing in its wing;-
That PARKER, noblest, truest, blest,
May long be spared to wield
A power unmatched-to bravely breast
Life's surging battle-field-
To bend his bow for right, and win-
With an unerring dart
To pierce the citadels of Sin,
And Bigotry's bare heart;-
And yet, with, child-like faith and trust,
With god-like mien and air,
To snatch Truth's banner from the dust,
And high aloft to bear
Its folds of beauty o'er a world
By wrongs and creeds oppressed:-
In starry radiance unfurled,
It gilds dark Error's crest.
Hope answers to intense desire,
That from thy soothing clime
He may return to reinspire,
While on the shores of Time,
Those who through mists, so dark and dense,
Follow where he has trod,
Shedding through life a 'gladdening sense
And consciousness of God.'
This cheers, sustains the trusting soul,
Whatever ill betides,
Which, reverently, in self-control
And perfect faith abides.
That faith and love not made a part
Of any sect or plan-
Thrilling responsive to the heart
Of UNIVERSAL MAN.

SABBATH WORSHIP,
I have worshipped in Nature's cathedral,
This glorious Sabbath in Spring;
In the temple of the living God,
Where for choir the wild birds sing.
In the house our Father builded,
That house, so vast and high,
Spread with a carpet of living green,
Its dome the bright blue sky.
My cushioned pew was a mossy stone,
Beneath a tall, dark pine,
By a spring that served for baptismal font,
And sacramental wine.
The congregation was made up
Of squirrels, and birds, and I,
And we listened there to the beautiful words
Of Nature's prophecy.
And miracles were unfolded,
Blades starting from the sod,
Each budding tree was whispering
Of a wonder-working God.
And the bright-winged choir sang sweetly
In the sombre pine above:
I translated the joyous chorus;
It told me, 'God his Love.'
Long time I <illegible> there <illegible>
On the lesson I had heard,
The old, old lesson, yet eye new,
Whispered by breeze and bird.
<c02>
I thought of life's great duties, 
And I felt my heart grow strong,
And nerved anew for the conflict
Of the right against the wrong.
Oh! never had pealing organ.
Or studied words of prayer,
Waked emotions so deep, so holy,
As were mine while seated there.
And regretfully I left it,
That church where I'd worshipped so well,
With a higher hope, and a worthier aim,
And peace words fail to tell.
Oh! ye who never worship,
Save in temples man has built,
Who by Sabbath prayers and praises
Would atone for six days' guilt;
Go, read from the book of Nature
The glorious lesson of life!
Go, learn there lore and justice,
Instead of discord and strife!
Learn too the sacred lesson,
Learn to live it all ye can,
The holiest of all lessons,
The brotherhood of man.

LETTER FROM MRS. FRANCES D. GAGE.
ST. THOMAS, April 1, 1859.
FRIEND GARRISON:
I know that every atom of testimony that can be given to our blinded people of the United States, in favor of emancipation, is valuable to you, and hence I rejoice to throw in my mite, be it ever so small, to help on that mighty work which seems (great and good as it is) to creep on with the slow progress of these coral rocks to completion.
We left Santa Cruz yesterday; and the last hand I shook was Theodore Parker's. He and his wife and Miss Stephenson-(God bless them, and keep them in the hollow of his hand, and return them in safety to us again )-accompanied us to the wharf-he walking with a firm step, and with apparent ease. We think he is better, decidedly. But he needs a long, long rest, and great care, to restore him to perfect health.
We came over to this point to take the sailing packet for St. Domingo, whither we turn our steps to-morrow morning. Now for the testimony: They told me at the boarding-house where I staid in Christianstad, Santa Cruz-they, I mean our boarders, American invalids and Danish and American sea captains-that the slaves repented their emancipation, and would be thankful if they were again under the protection of masters. This, of course, I did not wholly believe; but knowing well the nature of dependence, and how it will and does sometimes degrade human beings till they love it, (I have heard wives declare, 'It is beautiful to be dependent,') I did not know but it might be possible that this people, who eleven years since struck for freedom, might be pining for that irresponsibility which is ever the feeble child of oppression. So I set myself to work to find out what these people, who seemed so happy and cheerful, did really think about it. First I asked old Betsey-who, with swollen feet and warped hands, did the work in my room-'Betsey, would you like to be a slave again?' 'No ma'm-I'se better as I is. Missis gives me my room and clothes, and all I can cat, for what I does, and that's enough, thank the Lord!'
I asked the bright-eyed, laughing, light-footed table girl-Sophia, do you want to be a slave?-would you be better off?' 'Me? No-no-a master whip me, like 'nuff'-and away she bounded, with her box on her head.
I asked old Rachel, who washed and ironed my clothes-' Would you fare better if you had a master?' No, mistress; I'se my own master now. I works hard; I lays up-nobody takes from me; I works when I please, and stops when I please, and always has plenty.'
I asked the field-hands, working in the broiling sun-'Would you like to become slaves again?' 'No, never-we have good times now; we raise our little patch, and sell what we don't want; no driver to whip us; we lay up stivers in bank, and nobody takes it away; we never be slaves again; we send our children to school, and we go to the church; and we get married, and live in our own homes; if one massa don't suit, or missis, we go to another, when the cane is done; never be slaves-never, missies-never.'
I rose one morning early, and went out to the great well in Frederickatad, where groups of young girls were gathering with their buckets and kegs, to carry home the water to get their breakfasts. I chatted with them, and at last I said to them-'They say in the United States that you are sorry for your freedom, and mourn to be slaves again. Is it so?'
'No-no-no-it's all a lie. We slaves!!' And they looked at each other in mirth, and again and again repeated the negative to the question ere they moved off, with free and elastic steps, with their burdens.
I asked an old negro, whose hair was white as snow, and who kept up the fires under sugar kettles at the Constitution Hill estate, if he was once a slave. 'Oh yes, missis, always till the insurrection come; then I was free.' 'Had you a good master? 'Oh yes, missis, he was always good-tuk good care of us.' Are you worse off now? ' I dared not say the word slave to that brave-looking man. 'Oh, no, missis-no, missis-no, missis. Then it was work, work, all the time in the cane-night and day, night and day-no steam-no carts. Oh! it was whipping and driving and cussing. Now, when the sun goes down, the mills stop, and they put out the fire, and sleep till sun up. If I work late, I get pay; every thing better-every thing better; man hab his own wife; now, no man take her away-no sell his children; no, missis, not better off then-better off now.
'I asked our carriage-driver; and he answered-I would not be a slave'; and he turned proudly away.
I asked Old Jones, who took care of my rooms at Frederick tad, (I staid a few days on each end of the island,) if she would like to be a slave again. 'Me ,missis-me missis! you must be join'-I'd never be a slave again.' 'Was not your old mistress, good?' 'Yes, missis; and me work for her long as I live. I'se go down on my knees and work till the blood run, if she need; but I'se never be a slave.'
I began to despair of any willing to be a slave, when a poor, trembling, miserable old creature, bowed down with infirmities, and bending under the weight of eighty years or more, reached out her hand, begging for a stiver. I asked her if she had no home or mistress-for they all call the former owner old mistress, or master. She answered no-told a long story of her old <illegible> great estate-of his fine house, and horses and carriage; and when Emancipate came, he went , off to Copenhagen. She work for him seventy years, and then Emancipate left her without a stiver to pay doctor or buy bread. Old massa found it was coming, and sold all her children and her husband to go away to other islands in the sea. She wished she was a slave again, for then she could have a home, and old <illegible> would get the doctor; old miss never go off and leave, if it want for Emancipate.' So she told her simple tale of wrong.
This is not half of <illegible> asked the question-and only in this one case have I heard a wish for the protection of slavery expressed.
This is a beautiful island; but its fertility has been exhausted, and wrong and oppression have left the marks of their hands on the people. But there is one bright spot-one thing grander than its <illegible> of perpetual  <illegible> its towering peaks-
<c03>
richer than its hogsheads of sugar-and more exhilarating to the true heart than all its puncheons of rum-one that lifts the  <illegible> to God in thankfulness, and fixes the mind more firmly in humanity, and brightens every hope in the future-and that is, a man.
An Episcopal minister-a noble, honored one-well educated, talented, highly cultured and polished-who, rising above creeds and theologies, above the allurements of wealth and ambition, above the prejudices of education and early training-has come here, and settled himself down in this obscure island, and devoted himself to the highest interests of this so lately enslaved  <illegible> still despised people. Would that I could offer the tribute worthily that I feel is his due. But language fails me to express the emotion I feel. Let me then tell the plain, unvarnished tale of this friend of the oppressed:-
Mr. Doulians is twenty-eight years of age; born in Tortola, a neighboring island. His father's property was lost by Emancipation, and he, at the age of thirteen, sent away to the States to be educated. Settled as an Episcopal minister here in 1856, over a church of three hundred. Feeling the needs of the colored people, he started a day school, himself, in his vestry, with only seventeen dollars, taken from his own pocket. This he has kept up two years without any help from the Government, and little from the whites, who discouraged him. He has now 130 scholars, and hires his teachers; has a Sunday school for adults of some hundreds, learning them to read, &c. All this was not enough; he found that those people, by their long habit of being compelled to leave their sick and afflicted to the care of others, had grown careless of their paternal duties to each other. To remedy this, he established a 'Friendly, Society,' in which he binds them together to take care of each other, and lay by a little fund for the poor and the needy. Also, to watch over each other's morals, and help each other to be good. This has 300 members, and is doing a wonderful work.
Next, he persuaded them to lay up money; and they came to him to keep it for them; and soon he had hundreds of dollars in his hands, and felt compelled to put it into safe-keeping. So he established a 'Savings Bank,' and these people, reported so idle and improvident,' under the guidance of one real friend, are showing the world what they can do-if it will only help them. May he be long spared for his work!
But I must close this long letter. Oh! when will the time come that my cheek will not blush for shame over the enslavement of millions in my own native land?
F. D. G.
I have time for one word more. Every thing I see and hear denies the assertion that Emancipation has wrought injury to the slaves-or to the whites.

THE BIBLE IN SCHOOLS.
MR. EDITOR:-I do not profess any great love for the Roman Catholic religion. I think its tenets and doctrines are wrong, and its effects on the life, as a general thing, injurious.
It seems to me that Patrick and Bridget will hardly be very scrupulous to tell me the truth while falsehood will screen a fault, and may be atoned for to their Maker, for twenty-five cents.
But Patrick and Bridget are ready to walk three miles to church, rain or shine, and I am bound to conclude that their religion is all in all to them,-especially as my Orthodox friends, who are to be saved at my expense, and so contented with the arrangement, seldom take such pains to worship their implacable Jehovah. Now, poorly as I think of the religion of Patrick and Bridget, it seems to me infinitely better than no religion at all; and I should be very sorry to deprive their toiling, joyless lives of whatever joy and peace it can give.
When I see what fatigue these week-day workers undergo on Sunday for their religion-how careful they are to obey the rules of the church-how far ahead in these respects they are of their more enlightened Protestant neighbors-I do not wonder at the jealousy with which they watch everything likely to conflict with the doctrines which have such weight and importance to them. They profess to think (and I know of no sect which has given greater proof of sincerity) that our version of the Scriptures is wrong, that its teachings conflict with their belief.
How many of the Protestant sects agree about the rendering of the Bible? How do we know that we are right? And if we are, what right have we to say that the children of those who differ from us shall be taught out of our Bible?
Is not this the same sort of persecution which drove the Pilgrims from their pleasant homes, and forced them to brave the winter's cold on a desert shore? I, too, have children. I feel a deep interest in their moral and spiritual welfare; and if I thought them likely to learn the Orthodox theology at the public schools, not one of them should be subjected to the risk. 
I believe that the Catholics have the welfare of their children at heart as I have; that they have as good a right to control their religious education; and I would not force on to their children what no power should force on to mine. I hope to see the reading of the Bible in our public schools abolished. Some parts of it are totally unfit to be read to children, and the whole is capable of explanation in accordance with the tenets of any sect in the land.
Let the teacher inculcate good morals, but let him leave tenets and doctrines to the parents of the children under his charge.
Yours, for giving in all things as much liberty to others as we ask for ourselves.
SIMEON SIMPLE.

THE DEATH PENALTY IN MICHIGAN.
To the Editor of the Liberator:
Since the abolition of capital punishment in Michigan, statements have frequently been made, indicating an increase of crime as a consequence thereof; also, that the death penalty had been restored, or that an early return thereto was contemplated."
In answer to a recent note of inquiry, addressed to the Secretary of State, I have received the following which I communicate to you, for the information of such of the readers of the Liberator as are interested in the subject: 
STATE DEPARTMENT, MICHIGAN SECRETARY'S OFFICE, LANSING, March 19, 1859.
A. M. POWELL, Esq.-Sir: Your favor of the 16th is received. In reply, I have the honor to state that the death penalty has not been restored in this-State, and my opinion is that it is not seriously contemplated by any considerable number of our people. If I mistake not the popular feeling it is not to recede from the position taken some years since by the State on this question. The statistics will show a less number of convictions for murder, according to the population, than in the same number of years previous to the abolition of capital punishment, and such a result ought to be satisfactory.
Respectfully, &c.,
E. A. THOMPSON, Deputy Secretary of State.
The progress of humane legislation has always been slow, and seems ever to have been attended with distrust, as to its practical results. The above well-authenticated evidence from Michigan it is very, gratifying to note. How long shall it be ere similar gratifying testimonials may be sent forth from New York and Massachusetts?
May the day soon come when the horrible and barbarous capital executions, which now not infrequently occur, shall be ' known no more forever' upon our soil! 
AARON M. POWELL.
The Wisconsin Assembly has capitally executed, by a satisfactory majority, the bill adopted by the Senate for the restoration of capital punishment. The Milwaukee Free Democrat thinks the work of deliberately suspending men by the neck will never be resumed in that State.

CHARLES F. HOVEY.
The last week has been saddened to many Anti-Slavery hearts by the death of one of the truest friends of the Anti-Slavery cause, Charles F. Hovey died in Boston, on Thursday, April 28th, after a painful illness of many months, aged fifty-two years, and was buried at Mount Auburn, on Monday, the 2nd of May. He has been identified with the American Anti-Slavery Society, as an active friend and officer for so many years, that no coadjutor of the movement can be ignorant of the services he has rendered it, the liberality with which he has enlarged its means, and the wise sagacity with which he strengthened its counsels. But only they that knew him best, and saw the thoroughness of his fidelity to his convictions of truth in every direction, and the perfection of the beauty of his daily life, can know how great a loss the world has met with in the withdrawal of such an example from its walks and ways.
Mr. Hovey was a successful merchant, and had acquired a competent estate by his skillful enterprise in pries in business. And he showed how the traffic of the world can be carried on successfully without injustices, without meanness, and even without sel­fishness. His business relations were marked not only by the highest tone of mercantile honor, but by a spirit of magnanimous and generous consideration of all connected with his affairs that is rarely seen in trade. But he did not call or consider his conduct in any of its manifestations as either magnanimous or generous, but simply just. He was eminently a just man. He recognized himself, and he sought-to procure to be recognized by all, the rights of others in their fullest extent. He helped the slave on the plantation and the worthy poor at his door, because he acknowledged their right to what he could do for their relief.
But though his hand was open as day to melting charity, his beneficence was considerate and wise. No man could say "No" more readily and emphatically than he, even to requests urged by his best friends, when the objects suggested did not commend themselves to his judgment. "He had an instinctive perception of shams and make-believes, which seldom permitted his well-known liberality to be imposed upon by the unworthy. His opinions on all subjects he formed for himself, and was not to be shaken in them when definitely made up, by the differing sense of his dearest and best friends. And this with such a native sweetness of temper and kindliness of manner, that difference of opinion con­ ciliated instead of alienating affection and esteem. No more thoroughly independent man lived on the earth than Charles Hovey, no man who feared less the face of man, or was truer to the jointing of conscience, reason, and sympathy. And no man, perhaps, was ever more deeply loved and more sincerely mourned than he, by those who knew him best, however widely they might differ from him in matters of faith and practice.
When. Mr. Hovey was struggling with the world for the beginnings of his fortunes, the world in which he lived was Whig, Protective, and Bank-believing. He professed himself a Democrat, a Free-trader, and a Hard-money man, in times when such opinions were regarded with an intolerance scarcely I credible now, in the business circles where his daily walks lay. His politico-economical opinions he retained to the last, and he died in the faith of the good time coming when there would be neither Custom-houses nor Paper-money. And his intrinsic Democracy he lived and died in, too, though he ' soon saw through and spurned from him the impudent faction which tramples on the rights of the black man in its pretended zeal for the assertion of those of the whites. He indeed believed in that Democracy which regards Man divested of his Accidents,' to the last. A Man was a Man to him, whether white or black, rich or poor, learned or illiterate, and he maintained the rights of the Slave, the poor and the ignorant, because they were men, and had none or few to help them.
Shaking off the dust of his feet as against the Democrats, he soon betook himself to the Abolitionists. He discerned in them men who were sincerely pursuing a great public end, without taking counsel of flesh and blood, but following out their idea of duty whithersoever it might lead them. He at once united with the sect everywhere spoken against, and never ceased walking with it as long as he lived. He was constant in his attendance on the meeting of the I Executive Committees of the American and Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Societies, and was ever on the side of the most resolute action and the most outspoken utterance. His faith in the absolute policy of absolute truth was perfect. He knew no Expediency but the Right. In matters of simple opinion as to means, though he was firm in his own way of thinking, be gracefully and readily yielded to the prevailing action. In matters which seemed to him to savor of principle, lie was never to be shaken or moved a hair's breadth from the stand he had taken as the right position. He was ever in the midst of controversy on all sorts of subjects, but with no drop of acrimony in his temper, or of gall in his blood.
He formed his own opinions as to theological matters as deliberately, and maintained them as fearlessly, as he did as to all other things of human concernment. His views as to religious doctrines and institutions were distinct and unmistakable, and he never sought to conceal or palliate them in life or in death. With them, however, we have no concern. If to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly, were to walk with God, his conversation was in Heaven. If to do unto others as he would that they should do unto him, and to be kind unto the unthankful and the evil, were to be Christ-like, happy indeed is the disciple who can claim a closer resemblance to the Master than he! And they that knew him best and loved him most, as they laid his head in the grave, enjoyed an assured faith that a spirit so loving and so pure, so brave and so gentle, so wise and so true, must find elsewhere the Heaven it had made on earth.-Anti-Slavery Standard.
It is our painful duty to record the death of CHARLES F. HOVEY, Esq., which took place at his house in this city, on Wednesday morning last. Mr. H. has been ill for several months past from a rheumatic affection. It finally terminated in a disease of the stomach, and caused his death.
Mr. Hovey was a gentleman of great enterprise and sagacity as a merchant, and of marked probity and benevolence as a citizen. He was earnest and decided in his opinions, and energetic in proclaiming and defending them. But while he claimed perfect freedom in forming and promulgating his own convictions, he was always ready to concede the same; privilege to those who differed from him. He conducted his business with success, fairness, and generosity towards all associated with him. He had in contemplation many philanthropic purposes, which, had his life been spared a few years longer, he undoubtedly would have accomplished; but Providence has ordered otherwise, and be has been called, in the prime of manhood, to leave those who loved him tenderly in the dearest social relations, and a community which will long respect his memory as ' that of a kind, intelligent, and upright fellow-citizen.-Boston Post.
F.DEATH OF CHARLES F. HOVEY. This well-known Boston merchant, who was also a reformer as well as a trader, died at his residence on Kingston street, last Friday evening, after a lingering illness of several months, aged 52 years. Mr. Hovey was a very worthy man, and greatly esteemed by all who knew ' him intimately. Seldom does the grave close over' one in whom there was more real, practical goodness, with less show and pretension. A man of wealth, he had none of the airs that such people are apt to put on, but was always unassuming and genial in his manners, while towards the poor and unfortunate he was a friend indeed. Many who have been relieved by his private and generous bounty, will miss his kind face and open hand, hut they will not soon forget their liberal benefactor, and in their grateful remembrance he will have a fitting and lasting epitaph. He was likewise liberal in assisting the various reforms of the day, and his whole life presented the rare and honorable spectacle of a rich man making use of his wealth for the benefit of humanity, irrespective of country, sex, of color. He was also liberal in his views of religion, being strongly in favor of mental freedom as well as political, and a most decided opposer of every thing like priest craft, superstition, bigotry, and intolerance. What others gave to the cause of religion, was more than equaled by his donations and efforts to assist suffering humanity; and as he had lived an honest and useful life, and was too intelligent and faithful to his own convictions to be led by the church, he neither paid it any allegiance in life nor in death, but left orders that he should be buried without priestly services, and his request was complied with. The Pharisee and bigot (whose opinion at the best is good for nothing) may not see in the history of such a man a good example to imitate and follow; but if untiring benevolence and kindness, a hatred of

tyranny and oppression, and a practical endeavor to be truly serviceable to our fellow-men, politically, socially, and mentally, are the ingredients of a good character, that high distinction may be justly claimed for CHARLES F. HOVEY.-Boston Investigator.
Mr. Hovey occupied in trade a similar position to that held by Mr. Stewart in this city as a wholesale and retail dearer in dry goods. He was a man of rare integrity and singular unselfishness, and was consequently held in very high esteem by his fellow-citizens.-N. Y. Tribune.

THE BENEVOLENCE OF DEATH. 
The benevolence of death appears from this fact-that it boundlessly multiplies the numbers who can enjoy the prerogatives of life. It calls up ever fresh generations, with wondering eyes and eager appetites, to the perennial banquet of existence. Had Adam not sinned and been expelled from Paradise, some of the Christian Fathers thought, the fixed number of saints foreseen by God would have been reached, and then no more would have been born. Such would have been the necessity, their being no death. But, by the removal of one company as they grow tired and sated, room is made for a new company to approach and enjoy the ever-renewed spectacle and feast of the world. Thus all the delightful boons life has, instead of being cooped within a little stale circle, are ceaselessly diffused and increased. Vivacious claimants advance, see what is to be seen, partake of what is furnished, are satisfied, and retire; and their places are immediately taken by hungry successors. Thus the torch of life is passed briskly, with picturesque and stimulating effect, along the manifold race of running ages, instead of smouldering stagnantly forever in the moveless grasp of one. The amount of enjoyment, the quantity of conscious experience, gained from any given exhibition by a million persons to each of whom it is successively shown for one hour, is, beyond all question, immensely greater und keener than one person could have from it in a million hours. The generations of men seem like fire-flies glittering down the dark lane of History; but each swarm had its happy turn, fulfilled its hour, and rightfully gave way to its followers. The disinterested beneficence of the Creator ordains that the same plants, insects, men, shall not unsurrenderingly monopolize and stop the bliss of breath. Death is the echo of the voice of love reverberated from the limit of life.
The cumulative fund of human experience, the sensitive affiliating line of history, like a cerebral cord of personal identity traversing the centuries, renders a continual succession of generations equivalent to the endless existence of one generation; but with this mighty difference-that it preserves all the edge and spice of novelty. For consider what would be the result if death were abolished, and men endowed with an earthly immortality. At first they might rejoice, and think their last, dreadest enemy destroyed. But what a mistake! In the first place, since none are to be removed from the earth, of course none must come into it. The space and material are all wanted by those now in possession. All are soon mature men and women-not another infant ever to hang upon a mother's breast or be lifted in a father's arms. All the prattling music, fond cares, yearning love, and gushing joys, and hopes associated with the rearing of children, gone! What a stupendous fragment is stricken from the fabric of those enriching satisfactions which give life its truest value and its purest charm! Ages roll on. They see the same everlasting faces, confront the same returning phenomena, engage in the same worn-out exercises, or lounge idly in the unchangeable conditions which bear no stimulant which they have not exhausted. Thousands of years pass. They have drunk every attainable spring of knowledge dry. Not a prize stirs a pulse. All pleasures, permutated till ingenuity is baffled, disgust them. No terror startles them. No possible experiment remains untried; nor is there any unsounded fortune left. No dim marvels and boundless hopes beckon with resist­less lures into the future. They have no future. One everlasting now is their all. At last the incessant repetition of identical phenomena, the unmitigated sameness of things, the eternal monotony of affairs, become unutterably burdensome and horrible. Full of loathing and immeasurable fatigue, a weariness like the weight of a universe oppresses them; and what would they not give for a change! anything to break the night-mare spell of ennui-to fling off the dateless flesh-to die-to pass into some unguessed realm-to lie down and sleep forever: it would be the infinite boon!
Take away from man all that is dependent on, or interlinked with, the appointment of death, and it would make such fundamental alterations of his constitution and relations that he would no longer be a man. It would leave us an almost wholly different race. If it is a divine boon that men should be, then death is a good to us; for it enables us to be men. Without it there would neither be husband and wife, nor parent and child, nor family <illegible> and altar; nor, indeed, would hardly anything be as it is now. The existent phenomena of nature and the soul would comprise all. And when the jaded individual, having mastered and exhausted this finite sum, and looked in vain for anything new or further, the world would be a hateful dungeon to him, and life an awful doom; and how gladly would he give all that lies beneath the sun's golden round and top of sovereignty to migrate into some untried region and state of being, or even to renounce existence altogether, and lie down forever in the sweet slumber of the elysian grave! Without death, mankind would undergo the fate of Sisyphus-no future, and in the present the oppression of an intolerable task with an aching vacuum of motive. The certainty and the mystery of death create the stimulus and the romance of life. Give the human race an earthly immortality, and you exclude them from everything greater and diviner than the earth affords. Who could consent to that? Take away death, and a brazen wall girds in our narrow life, against which, if we remained men, we would dash and chafe in the climax of our miserable longing, as the caged king of the desert or of the air beats against his bars.
The gift of an earthly immortality conferred on a single person-a boon which thoughtless myriads would clasp with frantic triumph-would prove, perhaps, a still more fearful curse than if distributed over the whole species. Retaining his human affections, how excruciating and remediless his grief must be, to be so cut off from equal community of experience and destiny with mankind-to see all whom he loves, generation after generation, fading away, leaving him alone, to form new ties again to be dissolved-to watch his beloved ones growing old and infirm, while he stands without a change! His love would be left, in agony of melancholy grandeur, 'a solitary angel, hovering over a universe of tombs ' on the tremulous wings of memory and grief, those wings incapacitated, by his madly-coveted prerogative of deathlessness, ever to move from above the sad rows of funereal urns. Zanoni, in Bulwer's magnificent conception, says to Viola, 'The flower gives perfume to the rock on whose breast it grows. A little while, and the flower is dead; but the rock still endures, the snow at its breast, the sunshine on its summit.' A deathless individual in a world of the dying, joined with them by ever-bereaved affections, would be the wretchedness creature conceivable. As no man ever yet prayed for any thing, he would pray to he released, to embrace dear objects in his arms and float away with them to heaven, or even to lie down with them in the kind embrace of mother earth. And if he had no affections, but lived a stoic existence, exempt from every sympathy, in impassive solitude, he could not be happy, he would not be a man; he must he an intellectual marble of thought, or a monumental mystery of woe.
Death, therefore, is benignity. When men wish there were no such appointed event, they are deceived, and know not what they wish. Literature furnishes a strange and profound, though wholly unintentional, confirmation of this view. Every form in which literary genius has set forth the conception of an earthly immortality, or any preternaturally-prolonged exemption from death, has represented it as an evil, a stupendous burden, or a divine curse. The legend of the Wandering Jew, one of the most marvelous products of the human mind in imaginative literature, is terrific with its blazoned revelation of the contents of an endless life on earth. This story has been embodied, with great variety of form and motive, in more than a hundred works. Every one is, without the writer's intention, a disguised sermon of gigantic force on the benignity of death. As in classic fable, poor Tithon became immortal in the dawning arms of Eos, only to lead a shrivelled, joyless, repulsive existence; and the fair young witch of Comes had ample cause to regret that ever Apollo granted her request, for as many years as she held grains of dust in her hand; and as all tales of successful alchemists or Rosicrucians concur in depicting the result to be utter disappoint
<c06>
ment and revulsion from the accursed prize, we may take it as evidence of a spontaneous conviction in the depths of human nature-a conviction sure to be brought out whenever the attempt is made to describe in life an opposite thought-that death is benign for man, as he is constituted and related on earth. The voice of human nature speaks truth through the lips of Cicero, saying as the closed of his easy on Old Age, 'Quod si non sumus immortals future, tamen extingui homini sue tempore <illegible> est.'
In a conversation at the house of Sappho, discussion once arose upon the question whether death was a blessing or an evil. Some maintained the former alternative; but Sappho victoriously closed the debated by saying, 'If it were a blessing to die, the immortal gods would experience it. The gods lives forever; therefore, death is an evil!. The reasoning was plausible and brilliant. Yet its sophistry is complete. To men, conditioned as they are in this world, death may be the greatest blessing; while to the gods, conditioned so differently, it may have no similar application. Because an earthly eternity in the flesh would be a frightful calamity, is no reason why a heavenly eternity in the sprint would be other than a blissful inheritance. Thus the remonstrance which may be fallaciously based on some of the foregoing considerations-namely, that they would equally make it appear that the immortality of man in any condition would be undesirable-is met. A conclusion drawn from the facts of the present scene of things, of course, will not apply to a scene inconceivably different. Those whose only bodies are their minds may be fetterless, happy, leading a wondrous life, beyond our deepest dream and farthest fancy, and eternally free from trouble or satiety.
Death is to us, while we live, what we think it to be. If we confront it with analytic and <illegible> eye, it is that nothing which ever ceases in beginning to be. If letting the superstitious sense <illegible> over us and cow our better part of man, <illegible> crouch before the imagination of it, it assumes the shape of the skeleton-monarch, who takes the world for his empire, the electric fluid for this chariot, and time for his scepter. In the contemplation of death, hitherto, fancy inspired by fear has been by far too much the prominent faculty and impulse. The literature of the subject is usually ghastly, appalling, and absurd, with point of view varying from that of the credulous Hindu, personifying death <illegible> with a million mouths devouring all <illegible> , and licking them in his flaming lips a fire devours the moths, or as the sea swallows the torrents, to that of the atheistic German dreamer, who converts nature into an immeasurable corpse worked by galvanic forces, and that of the bold French philosopher, Carnot, whose speculations have led to the theory that the sun will finally expend all its <illegible>, and constellated life cease, as the solar system hangs, like a dead ornery, ashy and spectral, the ghost of what it was. So the extravagant author of Festus says:
'God tore the glory from the sun's broad brow, 
And flung the flaming scalp away.'
The subject should be viewed by the unclouded intellect, guided by serene faith, in the light of scientific knowledge. Then death is revealed, first as an organic necessity in the primordial life-cell secondly, as the cessation of a given form of life <illegible> completion; thirdly, as a benignant law, an expression of the Creator's love; fourthly, as the <illegible> condition of another and higher from of life. What we are to refer to sin is, all the lingering sicknesses preceding it, and the wrenching tortures sometimes accompanying it. Had not men <illegible> against God's laws, all would naturally reach a good old age, and pass away without suffering. Death is benignant necessity; but the irregularity and pain associated with it are an inherited punishment.
Physical death is experienced by man in common with the brute. Upon grounds of physiology there is no greater evidence for man's spiritual <illegible> through that overshadowed crisis than there <illegible> the brute's. And, on grounds of sentiment, man ought not to shrink from sharing his open future with these mute comrades. Des Cartes and Malebranche taught that animals are mere machines, without souls, worked by God's arbitrary power. Swedenborg held that ' the souls of brutes are a extinguished with their <illegible> by his doctrine of eternal monads, sustains the immortality of all creatures. Coleridge defended the same idea. Agassiz, with much power and beauty, advocates the thought that animals as well as men have a <illegible> life. The old traditions affirm that at least four beasts have been translated to heaven: namely, <illegible> that spoke to Balaam, the white foal that <illegible> rode into Jerusalem, the steed Borak <illegible> Mohammed on his famous night-journey, and the <illegible> that wakened the Seven Sleepers. To recognize as Goethe did, brothers in the greenwood and in the teeming air-to sympathize with all lower forms <illegible> life, and hope for them an open range of limitless possibilities in the hospitable home of God-is <illegible> more becoming to a philosopher, a poet, or a Christian, than that careless scorn which commonly <illegible> from regard, and <illegible> them to annihilation. This subject has been <illegible> treated by Richard Dean, in his 'Essay on the Future Life of Brutes.'
But on moral and psychological grounds the <illegible> vast between the dying man and the <illegible> brute. Bretschneider, in a beautiful <illegible> this point, specifies four particulars. Man foresees and provides for his death; the brute does not. Man dies with unrecompensed merit and guilt; the brute does not. Man dies with faculties and powers fitted for a more perfect state of existence; the brute does not. Man dies with the expectation of another life; the brute does not. Two contrasts may be added to these. First, man inters his dead with burial-rites, rears a memorial over them, <illegible> fondest recollections of them, which after change his subsequent character and life; but <illegible> heard of a deer watching over an expiring comrade, a deer-funeral winding along the green glades of the forest, or a mermaid-funeral in the <illegible> the sea? The barrows of Norway, the mounds of Yucatan, the mummy-pits of Memphis, the rural cemeteries of our own day, speak the human thoughts of sympathetic reverence and <illegible> survival, typical of something superior to decaying dust. Secondly, man often makes death an active instead of a passive experience, his will as it is his fate a victory instead of a defeat. As <illegible> sank towards his end, he ordered them to <illegible> fumes and roses on him, and to bring music; and so, with the air of a haughty conqueror, amidst the volcanic smoke and thunder of reeling France, his giant spirit went forth. The patriot is proud to lay his body a sacrifice on the altar of his country's weal. The philanthropist rejoices to spend himself without pay, in a noble cause; to offer up his life in the service of his fellow-men. Thousands of generous students have given their lives to science, and clasped death amidst their trophies achievements. Who can count the confessors who have through it bliss and glory to be martyrs for truth and God? Creatures capable of such deeds must inherit <illegible>. Their transcendent souls step from their rejected mansions, through the blue gateway of the air, to the lucid palace of the stars. Any means allotment would be discordant and unbecoming their rank.
Contemplations like these exercise the <illegible> of the brain, and quell the borrid brood of fest. The noble purpose of self-sacrifice enables us to smile upon the grave, 'as some sweet clarion's breath stirs the soldier's scorn of danger.' Death parts with its false frightfulness, puts on its true beauty, and becomes at once the evening star of memory and the morning star of hope; the Helper of the sinking flesh, the Phosphor of the rising soul. Let the night come, then; it shall be welcome. And, as we gird out loins, to enter the ancient mystery we will exclaim, with vanishing voice, to those we leave behind,
'Though I stoop
Into a tremendous sea of cloud, 
It is but for a time, I press God's lamp
Close to my breast;' its splendor, soon or late,
Will pierce the gloom: I shall emerge somewhere.'

'THERE IS NO DEATH!'
'Let us be patient! these severe afflictions
Not from the dust arise,
But, oftentimes, celestial benedictions
Assume this harsh disguise.
We see but dimly through the mists and vapors
Amid these earthly damps;
What seem to us but sad, funereal tapers, 
May be Heaven's distant lamps.
There is no death! What seems so is transition;
This life of mortal breath
Is but a suburb of the life elysian,
Whose portal we call death.
LONGFELLOW.

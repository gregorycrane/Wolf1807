REFUGE OF OPPRESSION
<c01>
A FOURTH OF JULY SPEECH!
Extracts from a speech delivered by Hon. ROBERT BARNWELL RHETT, at Grahamville, South Carolina, on the fourth of July!
My friends it would seem as if it were the destiny of nations to expand. No nation is content with its own. In Europe, they seize nations, colonize them, and extend their constitution under them. Russia in Asia. the French in Egypt and Asia Minor. England all over the world, and we on this content, which we will have. The most civilized nations are continually reaching on for expansion. Now, whether it be the order of God that other civilized nations and religion shall extend, I will not say. But he may design the Caucasian not only to be the conquerors, but the pastors of the world; to extend to all the people in the world; to benefits of Christianity, This may be His design. And of all the people in the world, what is confinement-it is of the people of the Southern States.
We must have expansion too. Shall we prohibited by our associates in this government from expanding, whilst they go abroad and take all our territories? Out here stand thirty degrees both sides of the Equator, in which the greatest tropical productions are grown. By the fiat of the Almighty, It is impossible to cultivate the land, except the white man have the African in conjunction with him. Now, shall we cast by the Almighty, and submit to coercion-allow ourselves to be cramped, hemmed in, by a hostile, antagonistic people? Will we not be abandoning a great principle given to us in this Southern country? Shall we not, when God has thus blessed us in our relations, go on? Shall we voluntarily submit to be staked down to particular spot, and shall we go no further? Shall we obey the dictates of a hostile foe? Never! Never!(Applause.) If we do this thing, what is our strength may be our weakness. Hemmed in, the ratio between the two populations may be disturbed, and then there stands by our Northern neighbor, ready to foment, and our slaves ready to rise. Are we doing to submit to this? I would break the Union upon this pretext, if no other. I say that we may not, dare not, without a base departure from our principles, let this be done. From the high position in which god hath placed us, from that great benefaction he designs, we dare not, infidelity to ourselves. submit to this confinement. I say, we shall extend. We will expand. The sons of Shem and Ham shall go forth together, and inherit that portion of the earth which the Caucasian cannot till. We will have it, and we will not ask any people, much less the people of the North.
A want of confidence in ourselves, in our rights, may sometimes be the reason why we lose them. We hear it said, if what we say is true, what danger is there? If it be of God, it will stand. What are you agitating about? Why, an institution may be perfectly sacred, and yet be overthrown. An institution can be perfectly legitimate, and yet it may be changed at different times, and lost. I believe, when the last trump shall sound, and men are called to judgment. that slavery will exist-yet may not blood fellow the exclusion of abandonment? what privilege is there which we have not forfeited? what man can stand and say, he is entitled to the benefits he is receiving day by day? Yes, the institution may be overthrown by our own inaptitude. He who says that the institution is legitimate, and sanctioned by the Almighty, and therefore makes no effort to support it, is a base recreant to his duty. god has not given as any privileges that are not to be maintained by vigilance. If we want a free government, we must each fight for it. Even your own personal integrity-how do you preserve it? Is it not by continual effort? Is it not the sternest effort of your life to beat down the evil in you-to have asserted the good in you? It is not so with nations? When, therefore a man talks of slavery, and gives that reason why he will not act, he is false to himself and to God.
At this very time, it is not for us to be quiescent. We cannot maintain institutions by vain appeals to justice; maintain them by submission, nor by argumentation. No; you must act, you must risk. Gentleman, we are not the same people with the people of the north. You are a different people. It does not matter if you came from the same old country. Our institutions have worked a radical difference in temper, in views in thoughts, and they at the north hate us for it. Look at the contest in Europe. There is a mighty contest for personality going on. God has established, by a variety of languages, that associations shall be limited. Men have split up into different classes. Look at the antagonism in Austria and Italy. Why is it the Austrian is hated in Italy? He has done his duty, and faithfully. Why is it the Italian will not endure the Austrian? it is because he is a foreigner-he is not one of us. Why was it that Scotland and England would not endure each other for centuries? Why is it the Pole longs for the government of his own nobles? why is it that Ireland still groans under subjection to England? It is because they are a different people. Ireland and England are not more different and antagonistic than the people of the north and of the South. We were thrown together by the revolution: but, from that time the whole history has not been that of one people. From the first tariff act until this day the North has sought to aggrandize itself at the expense of the South. We, by our statesmanship, superior statesmanship, have ruled. the prosperity of the United States, her glory, is the achievement of the southern statesmen. But they hate us the more for it. They look upon us as enemies. What is there now to keep us together? How long will this condition of thing last-this unnatural connection?
My friends, prognostics of a union in the South are not without encouragement. There are premonitions of a moral as well as physical remedy. Did you hear the mutterings of the tempest coming on the eve of the Presidential election? It is true, heretofore our policy has been submission. In that policy we have lifted up some of the most bitter enemies of the North. It has been in vain that such as a Dickinson and an Everett have told them you will dissolve this Union. Are you willing to be ruled by such men as the Wilsons, the chases and the Sumners of the North? Men who got into notice by appealing to the baser passions of their people. These are the passions by which the nobler virtues of the North reflect, by those who in private life are no longer considered. Are you content to submit to these robbers? To submit to their encroachments has been about enough for the last twenty years, but to submit after the Presidential election to their rule will be most desperate policy.
Let us make up our minds; the North becomes sectionalized; we will sectionalize for our defence. We have done this. If we do not sectionalize for our defence, the result is, we may be overwhelmed. Throughout the continent of the Southern uniting their forces. The wing party are taking the position for the rights of the South, and the Democratic party dare not fail.
<c02>
One difficulty occurs. The South will be prepared to take her part in the government. When this occurs, my friends, let me entreat you to endeavor to be united. Your first great duty is to make your property safes and then to make yourself free, and to have a free government of your own. When you have done this, in any questions which after or before that time arise, turn your face like flint against: any man who attempts to divide or separate your counsels. That man cannot be a friend to the South. 
If, in the Presidential election, our rights are victorious, then we have a guarantee and an augury of. a better future; if, on the contrary, which I think! most certain to be the case, then, my friends, let us separate from the North; let the glorious day-spring of a Southern Confederacy at length arise upon our troubled counsels. I know full well how difficult it is to break any Government, but the principles with which your ancestors threw off the British Government are to this day still alive in your bosoms. 
If my poor services shall ever be remembered, let it be said that for twenty years I did all in my power to preserve this Union, by keeping it within the limits of the Constitution; but at last, in despair, I turned to my home, my native land, and in my latter years did all I could to proclaim to the South-liberty, justice, and an independent Government.

SELECTIONS.
THE NEGRO. From the Free Church Portfolio.
It is very curious to observe how, in the religion, the politics, and the literature of the nation, the despised and outcast negro occupies the most prominent position, and has become ' the observed of all, observers.' Had there been no negroes in Africa, the history of the last twenty-five years in regard to the three departments named would have been far different from what it is. 
The negro was the primum mobile of the Florida war, which cost us forty millions of dollars. Sambo ran off from his Georgia master, and sought liberty among the everglades, and protection among the savages, which he could not enjoy in the place of his birth. The United States Government, which has long been the servile tool of the negro-drivers, at the instance of the latter, declared war against the Seminoles, with a view of getting back the runaways and breaking up their haunts. 
A negro was at the bottom of the Mexican War. The South, seeing that the free States of the Union: were likely to outnumber the slave States, because: the territorial possessions were chiefly north of the Missouri line, resolved to procure territory out of which they could make slave States, so as to keep up the balance of power in the Senate of the United States. The government therefore declared war on a feigned issue with the Republic of Mexico, and, at a cost of one hundred and fifty millions of money, procured California and New Mexico. It was then that the tide in the affairs of the slaveholders turned. For the first time, though not the last, they missed a figure in their calculations, and California and New Mexico arc both devoted to freedom. 
Lord Napier's recal from Washington by the. British Government, and his banishment to the Hague, originated in the negro. The short-sighted Englishman, imagining, like some of his predecessors, that the slave-breeders and their abettors at Washington were to be for ever the controlling power in the country, courted their smiles by pouring contempt upon his English principles; supposing that he was thereby promoting English interests. But he has found out before now that, if the negro is despised and down-trodden in America, he has got, the ear of Queen Victoria, and is powerful enough to effect the recal of an Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. 
It is the inevitable negro that has blown out and chilled the furnaces of Pennsylvania, and stopped the rolling mills, and spread desolation among her iron interests. We have coal, iron ore, and limestone, in such inexhaustible abundance that we could supply the iron wants of half the world. But we have no adequate tariff to protect those interests from foreign competition. 
The North, good natured descendants of the tribe of Issachar, cheerfully pay 30 per cent, more for Southern sugar than they need pay for the West Indian article, merely to fill the pockets of a few hundred sugar manufacturers in Louisiana. But when we ask in return that the iron interest of the North shall receive protection-why, that is a horse of another color. 
In the halls of Congress, the negro, his servitude land his freedom, are the staple of three-fourths of the speeches delivered. The negro builds up and plucks down-makes and unmakes political men at will. It was the negro who occasioned the attempted massacre of Sumner upon the floor of the Senate chamber, and then occasioned the premature deaths of Brooks and Butler, the guilty principal and accessory to the assault. The negro sentenced to political death and damnation most of those public men who broke down the Missouri restriction and passed the Kansas Nebraska Bill; and he has just begun to wreak his vengeance on Senator Douglas, the leader of the gang. 
Does an American wish to relax his features, stiffened in the pursuit of business, by an hour of hearty and recreating laughter, he goes to see Sand-ford and Christie's Opera Troupe, where Sambo convulses his audience with negro wit. Does he wish to regale himself by hearing the tones of exquisite music, he listens to the far famed negro melodies, which, strange to say, constitute the only American music we have. The daughter of the New York millionaire sings ' Old Folks at Home' in her father's; gilded saloon, to the music of a thousand dollar piano. And ' Oh carry me back to Old Virginny, and ' My Old Kentucky Home,' are heard at even tide in many a happy cottage beyond the Mississippi when the labors of the day are over. Not only hat the negro engrafted his minstrelsy upon the taste of the American people, but he has given his dialect to his oppressors. In other instances, the conqueror enstamps his style of speech upon the conquered, as was the ease with the Norman and the Saxon. But here it is just the reverse. The Southern member of Congress, if they were blackened and disguised, like the performers in Sandford's Troupe, might pass for improved specimens of their own negroes, African is their dialect and mode of pronunciation We are far from intending this as an affront to our Southern brethren, for, as Chrysostom was not the first, so was he not the last, of the golden mouthed Africans. And nowhere in all the land are there such displays of native oratory as among the plantations of the South. Keitt's only model of fine speaking was probably ' Old Ben,' the negro preacher on his father's farm in South Carolina; and Senator Tombs owes his characteristics to a similar cause. It is not the climate of the South so much as the negro that gives the Southern his affable manners, his softness of voice, and his eloquence., 
What name has attracted more attention in courts, legislatures, Governors' messages, and on the stamp, than that of Dred Scott, the negro of Missouri? What personage has become so world.
<c03>
wide and renowned in literature as 'Uncle Tom,' the negro? He is now speaking the language of the Magyar, the Pole and the Russian-rousing the sympathies of those distant peoples in behalf of his town-trodden race in America. He has even mastered the uncouth language of the Welsh, and is now pleading the cause of his brethren before that fiery people, waking up the thunder of their indignation at the wrongs they endure. All over America, all over Europe, and in far-off Asia, the negro's lament is heard in the plaintive language of Uncle Tom; and humanity is gathering together the elements of one vast storm, which will soon burst upon the head of the oppressor, and give him in his turn a taste of sorrow. 
It was a negro that formed the rock upon which the Methodist Episcopal Church split. Bishop Andrew had married a gang of negroes with a wife annexed, and wished, like other patriarchs, to drive slaves, and to be considered a good Christian too. But Sambo invoked the shade of Wesley and of Freeborn Garretson, and the church divided. And because the line of separation did not suit him, and the Church North did not break the yoke, every Conference, Annual and General, is converted into debating society, to discuss questions which will never end until his claims as a man and brother are recognized. 
It is a negro that has stained the glory of the American Tract Society, and forced its managers to herd, in opinion, policy and taste, with the New York Herald, Journal of Commerce, and such like. Professing a care of souls including the whole world, they neverthless ignored the case of four millions of American citizens, represented in the halls of the National Legislature-only because they ware negro slaves. Teaching the doctrine on a million of pages, that a fiery hell awaited all those who died ignorant of Jesus Christ and his gospel, and assured by whole presbyteries and synods in the South that abject heathenism was the real condition of the slaves-they look on, and see this mighty stream of souls plunging, like the waters of Niagara, into the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, yet never utter one word of sympathy for their lost spirits, nor one word of rebuke against the system that has ruined them. 
It is a negro that constitutes the capped volcano on which reposes the false peace of the American Board of Missions. To a negro, as the occasion, will the people of Pennsylvania be indebted for bringing up again the whole question of the habeas corpus, and fixing on firmer foundations than ever, as we hope, the rights and the privileges of the citizen. It was a negro who occasioned the late schism in the New School Presbyterian Church, and it is a negro who holds in his hand the match, ready and waiting to produce an explosion in the Old School, when the sign in the ecclesiastical zodiac is in the right place. 
A United States Senator from the State of Kentucky, while making a political speech in the city of New York, some time since, suddenly took ill in the midst of his harangue. 'I am sick!' exclaimed he. 'Why, what is the matter, my dear sir-apoplexy, or rupture of a blood vessel?' 'I am sick of the negro question.!' Another Senator, still more recently, on his way from Illinois to the seat of government, via Memphis, New Orleans, Havana, New York and Philadelphia-the shortest route!-addressed his friends at the latter place, and he, too, complained of sickness. ' I am sick and tired,' said he, ' of the negro subject.' And well he might be, for it has been as fatal to him as hemlock or deadly nightshade.
Strange indeed it is to see the ubiquity and prominence given, in the mysterious providence of God, to a people robbed and peeled! Strange to see how the people of the United States are actually controlled in their destiny for weal or woe by a race which the slaveholders and the Supreme Court have striven politically to annihilate! Strange how all the efforts made by Congress in compromise, by the Supreme Court in decisions, by the Church in her decrees of silence, only produce more agitation! If we belonged to this proscribed people, and felt the iron of slavery enter into our soul, in the midst of our degradation and ruin, we should feel proud and defiant at the thought that,. by an eternal decree of the Almighty God, the Politics, the Religion, the Literature, and the Jurisprudence of this guilty nation were inseparably interwoven with the destiny of the American slave.

DR. ADAMS AND MR. CHOATE.
The Salem Register has ventured to throw out to the reading community the following in relation to Dr. Adams' sermon, at the burial of Mr. Choate:
'Dr. Adams' sermon, like the one he delivered on the Sabbath after the news of Mr. Choate's decease, must have been offensive, from the tone of doubt pervading both as to the fate of his parishioner. Speculation at public funerals as to what has become of the soul of the deceased, seems to be in very bad taste, and in this case, considering the relative claims of Mr. Choate and Dr. Adams to the Divine clemency, they seem almost ludicrous. The Dr. seems not to entertain the slightest doubt that he shall enter Heaven; but it is difficult to see how he is to get there, except under the Universalist "scheme," which admits everybody. If anybody may be said to have a " smart chance " of eternal torments, it certainly is the man who has exerted all his efforts to prolong the slavery of four millions of men in this life; and, as the sailor said when he saw the slave-drivers with their coffle of slaves, " If the devil don't get such fellows, we may as well not have any devil." One cause of the prevalent distrust and disbelief in a future state of retribution probably is the acquiescence of so many persons in the claim which is set up by well-known and notorious hypocrites, that they shall not only go to heaven themselves, but shall have considerable to say in relation to the way in which heaven shall be peopled. The complacency and ease of these pharasaical rogues is a great cause of skepticism. The hard common sense of the world recognizes at once the fact that, they are worthy of hell, if anybody is, and the fact. that they do not fear it goes a great way to persuade, people that there is no such place.'
SERIOUS INTERROGATORIES. Speaking of the professional life of Mr. Choate, a writer says that be. ' had a truly noble name and fame. He always exerted himself to the utmost in every case. It made no difference to him what was the case.' To this wholesale puffer,' the Portsmouth Chronicle puts, the following significant interrogatories:-
'We have a serious question or two to ask. Is it e a noble fame to be successful in defeating the ends of public justice? Is it noble, or even honest, for the-lawyer who took an oath, when he was admitted to a the bar, that in his practice he would do no falsehood, nor suffer it to be done without exposure-is. it noble for him to resort to all manner of lying pleas and preposterous hypotheses, to get a rascal clear, whom he knows is guilty, and deserves to be in prison? 
'If a witness tells a lie, to get a comrade clear, it is perjury, and he is liable to go to the State Prison. If a lawyer tells a dozen or a hundred, to get all the rascals clear, and clears them all-it is noble! is it?

RUFUS CHOATE. 
Boston correspondence of the Anti-Slavery standard 
BOSTON, Aug. 15, 1859.
We hare not done with poor Mr. Choate yet. I see the Historical Society have been trying their hand at him, and not making much of a band at it, neither. In fact, people are getting sick of his name, and we are beginning to come to the conclusion that we did 'run that thing into the ground,' in a way that justly laid us open to the ridicule of your York cockneys. The Morphy dinner was a fool to it. You know we were a whole week burying the poor man-as long as it took to create the world in the beginning. From the moment the telegram came along, announcing his demise, the resolutionizing, and slang-whangery, and half-mast flaggery, and bell-tollery, and minute-gunnery, and all the rest of it were going on in one form or another. And on the day of the funeral, a military band in uniform, playing a dead march, was added to the rest of the tom-foolery with which that clever manipulator of juries was carried to Mount Auburn to be quiet at last! You have never had any thing like it, excepting the obsequies of Bill Poole-and really the one case does not look to common sense, much more absurd than the other. Mr. Choate was the champion of his ring, as was Bill Poole of his Each had his faculties and science at his fingers'-ends, and could double up an adversary more knowingly than most men in their respective lines. But the services to the public of neither of these gentlemen were of a nature to call for any particular demonstrations of public grief. I suppose they were both paid for whatever they did, in some coin or other, as they went along; and that should have contented their admirers, as it undoubtedly did themselves. But as New York can hardly be held accountable for the Apotheosis of Mr. Poole, neither should Boston in her entirety be made responsible for that of Mr. Choate. We really are not altogether such fools as we look. You would have known this, could you have heard the under-current of talk that ran through the streets all the time. 
There was never a more hollow pageant than this public funeral, and all the talk that went before it. It really stood for nothing. The sincere grief of family and friends it certainly did not represent, and the degree of admiration which the great forensic ingenuity of Mr. Choate excited in the public mind was not of a description or an intensity to demand such an expression. In fact, the character of a great winner of verdicts is not one that secures popular respect or permanent fame-unless his name be connected, like James Otis's and Erskine's, with great forensic battles of liberty. The laity may admire, but they do not greatly esteem, the Dalgettys of the law who are ready to fight on either or any side for 'pay and provant'-men who hold the opinion which it is said Mr. Choate himself put into the, epigrammatic and rememberable form, that 'all causes are equally good before the verdict!' There are great lawyers, it is true, who are respected and venerated in all times, but they are the <illegible> rather than the causidici, the calm thinkers of the chamber rather than the noisy wranglers of the bar, who obtain this place in general esteem. And no one, I am told, (for I had not even a speaking acquaintance with him,) would have seen this whole thing in a more comic point of view, than Mr. Choate himself. At the time of John Quincy Adams's public funeral, when he was lying in state in Faneuil Hall, Mr. Choate expressed his sense of the sort of thing in this professional mot: ' If this were my case, instead of Mr. Adams's, I had rather it were heard at chambers." But the case of Mr. Adams, as an ex-President and statesman, was entirely different from that of Mr. Choate, who was known only as a miraculous wheedler of juries-his public life having been conjured out of his political body by the long fore-finger of Mr. Clay on the floor of the Senate. And nobody would have seen the distinction sooner than he. 
One thing at least was very certain, that there was no possibility of its being a case of premature interment. For, if Mr. Choate had not been very dead indeed, he must have been recalled to life by hearing the names of the parties who took the initiative in his posthumous honors by the Bar of the city. Now, Mr. Choate was not 'a good hater '-he had hardly moral stamina enough for that-but he was not without his antipathies and aversions; and I am assured, by good authority, that he was by no means personally fond of certain gentlemen, connected with each other by blood and marriage, whose names are prominent in the earlier stages of these proceedings, and that he was far from mealy-mouthed in expressing those particular sentiments. So that it is regarded as a proof of his being dead beyond resuscitation, that he lies quietly under the galvanic battery of their eulogy. This, you understand, is the talk of the Bar and the town-for I have no personal knowledge on the subject. I believe you republished a part of Dr. Nehemiah Adams's Funeral Discourse, which, if your readers did not find entertaining reading, they must be dull fellows indeed. We looked upon it as one of the most diverting performances of recent times, and were as merry over it as mutes after a funeral. It raised a nice question in Natural History, however, as to what those creatures were which Mr. Choate found lying on their backs, and employed himself in turning over on their bellies with his stick one morning, by way of giving them a fair start in life. A lady of my acquaintance suggests that they may have been humbugs! What do you think of the hypothesis? 
I trust I shall have something to tell you in my next about the approaching Inauguration of the Webster Horror. Mr. Everett has postponed his voyage to Europe, whither he proceeds to place his youngest son at Oxford, for the purpose of making yet another speech on the occasion. Governor Banks, it is understood, is to make one on accepting it in the name of the State. This magistrate is generally regarded as very well-informed on the scientific point of the side on which his bread is buttered: but think he let the slice slip out of his fingers when he consented to be made the tool of Boston Hunkerdom as to the setting up of this Statue, and that it fell buttered-side down in the dirt. It is not a sacrifice the people of the State are well-pleased with and we shall have plenty of help in getting it taker away again. 
The majority of the people of Massachusetts did not suppose when they made Mr. Banks Governor that they were anointing a High Priest for the Apotheosis of the Man of the Seventh of March, and I think they will be ready to give him a significant intimation to that effect next winter. We got Judge Loring turned out, with a Governor backed by Hunkerdom on his side; and I imagine it will take much less time to clear our front yard of this brazen idol. And after that is done, I trust we shall have a city government with pluck enough to rid Faneuil Hall of the acre of canvass that cumbers in honor of the same broken-down politician. An besides that, only think of John Adams's bust being shouldered aside under the stairs by Daniel Webster! But none of these things can endure forever, or for long. I am much obliged to him, however, and to Mr. Choate, for the means of raising a letter in this very dry time. D.Y.

From the Clerkenwell (Eng.) News, July 30.
THE FRENCH SLAVE TRADE-NARRA.
TIVE OF STEPHEN BECKLEY.
On Monday last, a crowded meeting was held, notwithstanding a very brief and scanty notice, in Spafields Chapel, for the purpose of hearing from his own lips a statement of the facts connected with the history of the above-named colored youth, and of his kidnapping from Freetown, Sierra Leone; his being carried to the French colony of Cayenne, and there being sold to a planter as a slave, in which capacity he worked for the space of two years, when he providentially succeeded in making his escape in American brig to Boston, from whence he was transmitted by the British Consul to this country. 
George Thompson, Esq. having been called to the chair, in introducing the subject of the meeting, said that there could be no question in the minds of persons who watched with interest the proceedings of foreign nations at the present time with reference to the slave trade, that there was an intention on the part of several nations separately, if there was not a common consent on the part of a number of them collectively, to revive by a united effort, not only as extensively as it ever existed before, but even upon a more gigantic scale than formerly, that slave trade which had been the disgrace of our common country about fifty-five years ago, and which was only brought to an end. after a protracted struggle, by some of the most illustrious men that ever lived in England, one or two of whom still survive to reflect with pride upon those days of conflict, and, happily, of ultimately signal triumph. At the present moment, the United States were introducing slaves from Africa into America. Several cargoes-one amounting to 400 in number-had, in violation of the Constitution of that Republic, in contravention of the treaties into which its Government had entered with the Powers, of Europe, in detiance of the public opinion of the free States of that country, in outrage of all the principles of humanity, as well as its loud professions of republicanism, been imported into its slave States. In several instances, the States had met in their corporate and sovereign capacity to declare that they will-the Constitution of the Federal Government and all international treaties to the contrary notwithstanding-stand upon what they call their ' State rights,' and import as many as they please of the slaves kidnapped from the Western coast of Africa. The commerce in the human species had thus been revived, not merely as between State and State, which the American laws might permit, but between those States and nations of another continent. We knew, moreover, that the French were largely engaged in that illicit traffic. Unhappily, even our own West India planters, deprived as they were of the opportunity, if they had the intention, of going again to Africa to steal men, as their predecessors did, were attempting to revive something very closely resembling the old slave trade, by the importation of the natives of China, India, and other countries as nominal free laborers, but who understood neither the distances of the locality to which they were going, the language there spoken, the relative value of the money, the nature of the labor they would be called on to undergo, but were, nevertheless, inveigled by arts and contrivances of a most ingenious description to enter into contracts which bound them for five years to become the servants of such masters as the government might assign them. Not long ago, they had abundance of evidence, in addition to that they were previously in possession of, to prove that the system was nothing but a species of slavery under another name. Their own colony of Mauritius was unfortunately at that moment notorious not only for the habit of importing slaves from Madagascar, the Mozambique Channel, and other parts of the eastern world, but as being the grand rendezvous for foreign slaves, consigned to what was now called the ' free labor' or ' immigration ' system, by which men were deluded in the first instance into entering into contracts which they did not understand, by which they were deprived of all opportunity of carrying their labor into the market; and when they arrived at their destination, they found that they were entirely dependent on the arbitrary will of strangers, and were without any efficient supervision. In such a state, the man was in net a slave, and the probability of his return to his native country was extremely uncertain. There was then upon the platform a colored youth who had been a victim of slavery in his own person, and who would be able to give a narrative, however disjointed or imperfect is might be, of the slavery to which his countrymen as well as himself were exposed, if they were not at the present moment actually suffering from. The object of the meeting was to endeavor, if possible, by means of the narrative of Stephen Beckley, to excite an interest in the country to which be belonged-Africa. 'Africa, at present degraded,' said the speaker; 'Africa, which has been plundered of her children for centuries,-Africa, over whose sands no wind has passed for ages without gathering up the sighs and sobs of coffle-chained slaves on their way to the coast, to be banished forever from the land of their nativity-Africa once, however, redolent of arts and sciences, even when our own country was in a state of barbarism, so degraded that it is scarcely possible to believe that a nation which is now leading the van in civilization could have sprung from a condition so low. This youth is a representative of Africa-Africa which, in bygone centuries, sent statesmen to the <illegible>, warriors to the field, bishops to the church, and martyrs to the stake-Africa, yet, I believe, in the providence of God, and in the fulfilment of that great design in accordance with which the whole earth is to be covered with the knowledge of the true God, which shall again as-same her place among the nations and tribes of the. j earth, and, together with England and the rest of, the world, show that she, like the most favored parts, of the earth at the present time, can furnish not only the greatest proofs of civilization, but those higher graces with, which Christianity alone can t crown the efforts of men to reach the highest stage of existence.' (Loud cheers.) 
WASHINGTON'S WLL OF EMANCIPATON.
It is well known that Washington provided in his will for the liberation of all his slaves. The will is given in full in the last volume of Irving's Life of Washington, just issued; and presuming the item with reference to all his slaves would be interesting to our readers, we quote it in full. 
'Item. Upon the decease of my wife, it is my will and desire that all the slaves whom I hold on my own right shall receive their freedom. To emancipate them during her life would, though earnestly wished by me, be attended with such insuperable difficulties, on account of their intermixture by marriage with the dower negroes, as to excite the most painful sensations, if not disagreeable consequences to the latter, while both descriptions are in the occupancy of the same proprietor; it not being in my power, under the tenure by which the dower negroes are held, to manumit them. And whereas, among those who will receive freedom according to this de-
<c06>
vise, there may be some, who, from old age, or bodily infirmities, and others, who, on account of their infancy, will be unable to support themselves, it is my will and desire that all, woo come under the first and second description, shall be comfortably clothed
and fed by my heirs while they live; and that soon of the latter description as have no parents living, or, if living, are unable or unwilling to provide for them, shall be bound by the court until they snail arrive at the age of twenty-five years; and, in cases where no record can be produced, whereby their ages can be ascertained, the judgment of the court, upon its own view of the subject, shall be adequate and final. The negroes thus bound are (by their masters or mistresses) to be taught to read and write, and to be brought up to some useful occupation, agreeably to the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, providing for the support of orphan and other poor children. And I do hereby expressly forbid the sale or transportation out of said Commonwealth, of any slave I may die possessed of, under any pretence whatsoever. And I do, moreover, most pointedly and most solemnly enjoin it upon my executors here after named, or the survivors of them, to see that this clause respecting my slaves, and every part thereof,
be religiously fulfilled at the epoch at which it is directed to take place, without evasion, neglect, or delay, after the crops which may then be on the ground are harvested, particularly as it respects the aged and infirm; seeing that a regular and permanent fund be established for their support, as long as there are subjects requiring it; not trusting to the uncertain provision to be made by individuals. And to my mulatto man, William, calling himself William Lee, I give immediate freedom, or, if he should prefer it, (on account of the accidents which have befallen him, and which nave rendered him in capable of walking, or of any active employment,) to remain in the situation he now is, it shall be optional in him to do so; in either case, however, I allow him an annuity of thirty dollars, during his natural life, which shall be independent of the victuals and clothes he has been accustomed to receive,
if he choose the last alternative; but in full with his freedom, it he prefers the first, and this I give him, as a testimony of my sense of his attachment to me, and for his faithful services during the revolutionary war.'

THE DISSOLUTION THEORY. 
As some of our readers entertain the idea that a dissolution of the Union would pat an end to slavery, we would invite them to review, with us, the grounds for this conclusion. Let as take, in the first place, the popular impression of a great number of persons in the North, that a dissolution would render the majority in the Free States more anti-slavery in sentiment, and in political and economical connection. This idea is sufficient of itself for a separate discussion. 
Look at the political relationships of the two sections when erected into separate and independent nations, under circumstances greatly calculated to produce and perpetuate mutual jealousy and hostility. The Southern Republic is now as independent of the Northern, in a political sense, as the latter is of the Kingdom of Prussia. They have divided entirely on the question of Slavery, though firmly united on every other subject of interest. The South could not and would not endure even the small measure of interference with that exciting question which the Constitution allowed the North to exercise; therefore it cut the bonds of union, and withdrew into a separate nation. And now it is in a position to be more vigorously and efficiently opposed to Northern interference than ever. It can put in force more retaliatory measures. It can form political and commercial relationship with European countries, to the great disadvantage of Northern interests. It can make a different scale of duties in favor of England, France, Germany and Russia. It can establish complete free trade with those countries, and virtually prohibitive duties on Northern manufactures. It could easily sell its $100,000,000 worth of raw cotton to those countries without the intermediate factorage of New York and Boston. It could import an equal amount of European goods, without the shipping and warehousing of those cities. And what it could do it would in retaliation upon the North for any hostile acts or agitation against slavery. It seems, therefore, to our mind perfectly clear and conclusive that all the manufacturing and commercial communities of the North would become twice as pro-slavery as they were when Garrison was mobbed under the windows of Faneuil Hall; and when abolitionists were persecuted almost to death at the instigation of influential men in New York and Philadelphia, 'Great is Diana of the Ephesians!' was shouted in the streets of the Grecian city. 'Great is Jupiter Mammon!' was the cry of the commercial central of the North when their southern trade was threatened by southern nullification. But if such a hue and cry against anti-slavery agitation was raised by the apprehension of losing a portion of the southern trade in 1835 and 6, while yet the South was in the Union, and could not nullify the revenue laws, nor establish free trade with England, what kind of cry would arise in the North and what kind of influence would pervade its leading populations, if the South were separated into an independent nation, and empowered to adopt any measures which it might deem mete and proper to punish or prevent overt acts of hostility against its domestic institutions? Is there moral strength enough in the anti-slavery sentiment of the North to stand such a test? If, when the American slave-trade is put on the same category of crime as piracy and punished with death, there are men to build and fit out ships from nearly all the ports of New England for the traffic, what would be the condition of public sentiment when the great and dazzling bribe of southern trade should be held out as a consideration for silencing anti-slavery agitation! Is it not easy to fancy the cries and arguments which would be put forth in every Ephesus of the North?' Don't meddle with slavery? It is the domestic institution of a foreign country; if we ever had any right or reason to interfere when the countries where one, we have none now when they are divided; no more than we have to agitate against aristocracy in England, or serfdom in Russia. We have no more political power over the South now, than over a European nation. We cannot out-vote her in Congress on the tariff, nor saddle protection, of Northern manufactures upon her neck by a Northern majority. If we annoy her on the old son question, which drove her out of the Union, she will use her power of retaliation to the atmost; she will throw all her trade into the bands of Europe; we shall lose all the factorage and shipping of her cotton, rice, and tobacco; all the profitable importation of the foreign goods for which these staples are exchanged. She will shut out of her markets all the manufactures of the North, and we shall have nothing but a little Western grain, floor and lard, and a small quantity of Northern manufactures wherewithal to trade with the rest of the world. What is the use of running one's head against a wall? What is the use of anti-slavery societies, papers, and meetings, and speeches now? Come, now, we have had enough of this. It don't pay.' 
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
The United States Constitution is 'a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell.'
The free States are the guardians and essential supports of slavery. We are the jailers and constables of the institution. There is some excuse for communities, when, under a generous impulse, for communities, when, under a generous impulse, they espouse the cause of the oppressed in other States, and by force restore their rights; but they are without excuse in aiding other States in binding on men an unrighteous yoke On this subject, OUR FATHERS, IN FRAMING THE CONSTITUION, SWERVED FROM THE RIGHT. We their children, at the end of half a century, see the path of duty more clearly than they, and must walk in it. To this point the public mind has long been tending, and the time has come for looking at it fully, dispassionately, and with manly and Christian resolution. No blessing of the Union can be a compensation for taking part in the enslaving of our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to be perpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that it can only continue through our participation in wrong doing. To this conviction the free States are tending.'-WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING.

Now we would appeal to those of our readers to say if we hare exaggerated the pro-slavery influence, which a dissolution of the Union would set in operation upon the manufacturing and commercial communities of the North?

From the Boston Journal.
CUBA HOW SHALL WE GET IT?
A recent writer, who seems to be pretty well �posted up' as to this Island, considers it 'manifest destiny' that it most fall into our hands at last, and in a long and very plausible article undertakes to show that Mr. Buchanan's method of obtaining it is the wisest and best, because the treaty of sale must be made in a moment with some minister who is just going out of power, and want money to retire upon, or with a new one, who is just coming into power, and wants money immediately to enable him to carry on the government. By watching opportunities, he is quite sure that such a chance will occur, and in order to avail ourselves of it, we must have an agent at hand, who shall be ready to furnish bills on London for the first payment the moment the treaty is signed; that having such a treaty signed, and having made the first payment, the Island will be ours, and we shall have nothing more to do but to take peaceable possession of it. He objects to treating openly and above-board, because Spain is a representative government, and �under such governments treaties have to be ratified by popular bodies, after they are made, and ratification implies time, discussion, possible rejection�at all events complete publicity.' The fallacy of this proposition is seen at once in the words we have italicized. If treaties with Spain are invalid until they are ratified by her Legislature, how is that ratification to be obtained out of the usual course?�how are time, discussion, possible rejection to be avoided? Suppose that some outgoing or incoming Spanish Premier were to conclude and sign such a treaty, would it be any treaty at all, without going through the usual form of ratification? Would our agent give his bills for thirty millions on the security of such a bill of sale? There is �a cat in the meal' which the writer does not choose to exhibit. Take this bill of sale of an unauthorized agent, pay the money, demand the property, and if it is not surrendered, is there not legitimate cause of war?�have we not the right to take our own, after we have bought it and paid for it? He knows right well�so does every man of common sense know�that a treaty so obtained would never receive the ratification of the Spanish Cortes, and that the only possible advantage to be derived from it would be that we have stated. Suppose the attempt successfully made, and the treaty if it can be called a treaty�to be rejected by the Cortes, and we then proceed to uncover the cat- threatening war if Cuba is not given up and actually declaring it�will the powers of Europe stand by, and quietly see Spain defrauded of the brightest a jewel in her crown, through this wooden nutmeg operation? We think not; but if it should prove otherwise, and Spain is left alone to measure strength with us, are we so very sure of success?
Spain is not Mexico. Rusty, somewhat run out she is�poor also, but she has a vast deal of strength left yet. Cuba is garrisoned by 25,000 regular troops, and the number may easily be doubled, long before we could raise 20,000 new recruits. The Spanish troops are at home in Cuba, perfectly acclimated, with no fear of �black-jack� before their eyes, while ours would have not only to contend with men, but also with the more formidable climate, which in the heats of summer will be more to contend against than against the best troops in the world. We place a high estimation on Anglo-Saxon valor and obstinate courage, but these are precisely the qualities for which well-disciplined Spanish troops are held in high esteem. Our men would be in the open field, strangers fighting for conquest, under every possible disadvantage, while the Spaniards would be at home, defending their own possessions, and animated by the highest motives of patriotism to conquer or to die in the last ditch. In our opinion, they would be able, with their defensive works, to defend themselves successfully against 50,000 of the best troops in the world; and where are we to obtain even that number?
If manifest destiny is to throw Cuba into our arms, it will not be done by bribing a Spanish Premier, even with 300,000,000 of dollars, to make a bargain which his countrymen will repudiate; nor will it be done by conquest in this generation, unless we can bribe the Spanish soldiers also. We are somewhat intoxicated with our successes over the broken down, worn out, half civilized Mexican troops, but before we attack Spain and attempt the conquest of Cuba, it will be best to sober down a little, consider who and what we shall have to deal with, and whether we are quite sure of success. We have no objection to offer against receiving Cuba, if it can be fairly obtained, but we do object decidedly to all the means to that end yet proposed, both because they are dishonest, and. likely to he defeated.
THE FUGITIVE SLAVE TO HIS MASTER. From the Jamestown,(N. Y.,) Journal.
'FUGITIVE'S HOME, SANDWICH, C. W., March 19, 1859.
Mr. WM. REILEY, Springfield, Ky.�Sir: I take this opportunity to dictate a few lines to you, supposing you might be curious to know my whereabouts. I am happy to inform you that I am in Canada, in good health, and have been here several days. Perhaps, by this time, you have concluded that robbing a woman of her husband, and children of their father, does not pay, at least in your case; and 1 thought that while lying in jail by your direction, that if you had no remorse of conscience that would make you feel for a poor broken-hearted man, and his worse than murdered wife and children, and could not be made to feel for others as you would have others feel for you, and could not by any entreaty or persuasion be induced to do as you promised you would, which was to let me go with my family for $800�but contended for $1,000, when you had promised to take what you gave for me, (which was $660,) at the time you bought me, and let me go with my dear wife and children; but, instead, would render me miserable, and lie to me, and to your neighbors, (now, if words mean anything, what I say is so,) and when you was at Louisville, trying to sell me, then I thought it was time to make my feet feel for Canada, and let your conscience feel in your pocket. Now, you cannot say but that I did all that was honorable and right, while I was with you, although 1 was a slave. I pretended, all the time, that I thought you, or some one else, bad a better right to me than I had to myself, which you know is rather hard thinking. You know, too, that you proved a traitor to me in the time of need, and when in the most bitter distress that the human soul is capable of experiencing; and could you have carried out your purposes, there would have been no relief. But I rejoice to say that an unseen, kind spirit appeared for the oppressed, and bade me take up my bed and walk�the result of which is, that I am victorious, and you are defeated. I am comfortably situated in Canada, working for George Harris, one of the persons that act a part in �Uncle Tom's Cabin." He was a slave, a few years ago, in Kentucky, and now owns a farm so level that there is not hills enough on it to bide a dog, yet so large that I got lost the other day. He says I may be the means of helping poor fugitives, and doing them as much good as he does, in time. This country is not what it has been represented to me and others to be. In place of being cold and barren, it has a beautiful comfortable climate, and fertile soil. It is much more desirable in these respects than any part o Kentucky that I ever saw. There is only one thing to prevent me being entirely happy here, and that is the want of my dear wife and children, and you to see us enjoying ourselves together here. I wish you could enjoy the contrast between Freedom and Slavery; but it is not likely that we shall ever meet again on this earth. But if you want to go to the next world, and meet a God of love, mercy, and justice, in peace; who says, �Inasmuch as you did it to the least of them my little ones, you did it on to me��making the profession that you do, pretending to be a follower of Christ, and tormenting me and my little ones as you have done�yon had better repair the breaches you have made among us in this world, by sending my wife and children to me; thus preparing to meet your God in peace; for if God don't punish you for inflicting such distresses on the poorest of His poor, then there is no use of having any God, or talking about one.
But, in this letter, I have said enough to cause you to do all that is necessary for you to do, providing you are any part of the man you pretend to be. So I will close by saying that, if you see proper to reply to my letter, either condemning or
<c02>
Justifying the course you have taken with me, I will again write you. I hope you will consider candidly, and see if the case does not justify every word I have said, and ten times as much. You must not consider that it is a slave talking to 'massa' now, but one as free as yourself,.
I subscribe myself one of the abused of America, but one of the justified and honored of Canada,
JACKSON WHITNEY.
From the London Anti-Slavery Advocate for August.
DR. POMROY IN LONDON.
We are sorry to inform our readers that the London Missionary Society and the Congregational Union have followed the example of the Evangelical Alliance, by giving 'the right hand of fellowship� and a �cordial welcome� to this distinguished member of the pro-slavery party. We believe this is in some measure the result of ignorance of the facts, and that if the thing were to be done over again, there are many earnest supporters of missions who would decline to be implicated in the spread of that religion which has introduced slavery amongst the Cherokee and Choctaw Indian nations. Dr. Pomroy has certainly no reason to feel proud of the position he occupies. He has, it is true, been �welcomed' by the great religious organizations of the country. But what of that? In order to secure this, he has had to misrepresent facts; and now that the case against him has been clearly stated in the columns of the Nonconformist, the Patriot, and other papers, he can only hang his head in silence, not daring to gainsay a single word. But whilst he has discreetly declined to answer any of the charges brought against him, he has not neglected to poison the minds of some who have heretofore professed adherence to the anti-slavery cause. Amongst others, we may point to the Rev. Dr. Campbell, editor of the British Standard, as one of those who allowed Dr. Pomroy to hoodwink them. The Doctor has made eloquent speeches on behalf of the anti-slavery movement; and on one occasion he went so far as to say, �No slaveholding American shall ever cross my door. No slaveholding or slavery-sanctioning minister shall ever pollute my pulpit.' And yet the man who could speak thus boldly is the only person-so far as we know�who has attempted publicly to say one single word in defence of the hypocritical conduct of Dr. Pomroy. A pretty defence it is; and as it is chiefly remarkable for its brevity, we shall give it in extenso. The British Standard of may 9th, 1859, has the following reply to some letters on Dr. Pomroy's jesuitry, which had appeared in the Nonconformist of the previous Wednesday:-
'Certain parties are hereby given to understand that we decline to drag this gentleman [Dr. Pomroy] before the British public, as �equally dishonest and jesuitical." Before we can apply such language to such a man, we must have far higher authority than Mr. Garrison and his Liberator, which for many long years has poured the foul slime of unscrupulous abuse and envenomed malignity on multitudes of the wisest and noblest men of the present generation. That Dr. Pomroy declines to answer the insolent letters addressed to him does not prove that he is verily guilty, but only that he is properly and verily discreet, standing on his character, and confidently leaving it to defend itself.'
The friend to whom we are indebted for the information respecting Dr. Pomroy, is unaware that, many years ago, the Rev. Dr. Campbell gave ample proof that his hatred to slavery is by no means so ardent as the odium theologicum by which he is consumed. His sectarian sympathies are so strong that they utterly blind him to the pro-slavery course of Dr. Pomroy. The remarks of Mr. Horner in his Anti-slavery Tactics' (noticed in our present number) on the blinding influence of sectarian prepossessions on the anti-slavery judgment of professors, are worthy of all acceptation.
HUMBOLDT ON WEBSTER AND SLAVERY. 
�For thirty years�for thirty years (and he counted them on his fingers)�you have made no progress about slavery; you have gone backward�very far backward in many respects about that. I think especially of your law of 1850, that law by which a man in a free State, where he ought to be free, can be made a slave of. That I always call the Webster law.
I always before liked Mr. Webster. He was a great man. I knew him, and always till then liked him. But ever after that, I hated him. He was the man who made it. If he wanted to prevent it, he could have done it. That is the reason why I call it the Webster law. And ever after that, I hated him.'
I made some remarks about Mr. Webster's influence on that point not being confined to a political sphere, but of his also carrying with him that circle of literary men with whom he was connected. �Yes,' said he, �it was he who did it all; and those very men not connected with politics, who ought to have stood against it, as you say, he moved with it. You came from New England, where there is so much anti-shivery feeling, and where you have learned to think slavery is bad. While you are here in Europe, you may see things which you think bad; but I know Europe, and I tell you that you will find nothing here that is one halt so bad as your slavery is.'
These were the opinions of Baron Humboldt, a Christian philosopher of world-wide renown, whose views of men and of nations went further to establish their character, than any man now living. As Humboldt thought, the Christian world would think. Mr. Webster, as one of Fillmore's Cabinet, approved the Fugitive Act, and lent his personal and official influence to sustain it. By doing that, he let down his own moral nature. He not only disgraced himself, but the nation who placed him in that conspicuous position. We would not speak unkindly of any man; but who that reads and reflects can be ignorant of the fact, that all who sustain or sanction that infamous enactment must tarnish their own characters, and degrade themselves in their own opinion, and in the opinion of all good men?�Ashtabula Senlinel.

NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
BOSTON. SEPTEMBER 2, 1859.
ANOTHER CELEBRATION.
The colored people of Harrison, Jefferson, and Belmont counties, Ohio, held a celebration at Harrisville on the lst inst. There was a large number in attendance, both of colored and white. They formed a procession at half-past ten o'clock, and marched to a grove at the north of the town, where D. S. Bruce President of the day, made an excellent speech on the history of the colored race. He took a historic review of Slavery from the earliest time to the present, the abolition of the slave-trade, and the abolition of slavery in the West Indies. He noticed the commerce before and after that event, and the internal improvememt, education, and social condition of the people After dinner, J. H. Gurley was introduced; he continued the same subject in an able manner, refuting many false assertions in reference to the colored people. The next speaker was Charles Ferrel. He reviewed the religious position assumed by the people in this country in reference to slavery. This speech was listened to with attention and interest. After which, Messrs. D. s Bruce, J. Manley, H. McGee, J. L. Rivers, and M. M. Smith, were elected delegates to attend the State Convention to meet at Toledo or Sandusky this fall; after which, the assembled multitude repaired to their homes. The celebration was one which reflected great credit upon the character of the colored people, for the arrangement, speaking and order preserved. It will awaken a spirit of activity among the rising generation.
�THE DISSOLUTION THEORY.' In another column we have copied an article from the pen of ELIHU BURRITT, setting forth (after the most approved manner of Northern hunkerism) some of the� terrible consequences' that would arias to the North�none a apprehended to the South�in case of a dissolution the American Union. Mr. B. evades the moral issue made by the Abolitionists, as against the existing Union under a slavery-protecting Constitution, and treats it as though it were a question of dollars and cents! His reasoning is as absurd as his prophecies are doleful. Please meet the moral issue, Mr. Burritt.
<c03>
A DIFFERENCE, AND THE SEASON OF IT. 
As if with foresight of the deceitful use that would ultimately be made of a� profession� of his religion, Jesus said to his disciples�' Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father.' 
At the present day, so great has become the impudence of the clergy who pretend to teach in the name and by the authority of Jesus, that they practically reverse this doctrine, and not only accept the profession' as a substitute for honesty and justice in the life of the individual who makes it, but decry good principles and right practices where they exist with- out the �profession,' and, in the few rare cases where these go together, they praise and value the profession' more than the life. Take the following specimen from the Independent of Aug. 25th.
In an article distinguished by leaded type, and headed Ohio Christian Anti-Slavery Convention,� statements are made respecting a meeting thus entitled, and composed chiefly of members of the Congregational, Free Presbyterian and Wesleyan Churches. The article gives the following statement of the principles which ought to be declared, and the stand Which ought to be taken in such a meeting, and adds this an abstract of the purport of the Resolutions actually adopted. To both these, we request the particular attention of our readers.
�It must be obvious to all thinking minds, that Christian anti-slavery men are called upon to go back to first principles; to treat slaveholding as one the highest sins against God, and one of the greatest crimes against man, and to arouse the Christian sentiment of the land-to a distinct and emphatic condemnation of the �sum of all villanies;� to stir this question to its foundations, and to bring the whole moral power of God's Word and the Christian church into intense activity for the overthrow and destruction of slavery. 
'The resolutions were explicit and comprehensive. They assert the right of every human being, under the natural and revealed law of God, to life, liberty and knowledge; that governments have no just authority to violate the will of God, nor to deprive any human being of his liberty (except for crime;) that the fugitive-slave act neither changes the law of God, nor the rights of man, nor the duty of Christians to feed the hungry and to clothe the naked.'
The principles and methods stated in the first of the above paragraphs as those which ought to distinguish Christian anti-slavery meeting are precisely those which always have distinguished the meetings and the course of action of the American Anti-Slavery Society. The abstract of Resolutions in the second paragraph expresses precisely the ideas that have always been declared and advocated in the meetings of that Society, and published in the records of their proceedings, so as to be known and read of all who were disposed either to hear or read them. In these two particulars then, the very points that seem most important as giving character and efficiency to the meetings, the �Ohio Christian Anti-Slavery Convention' is the exact counterpart of the American Anti-Slavery Society. 
Are there any differences between these two meetings? Yes, two, and only two, both of which are creditable to the American Society's meetings, and discreditable to the Ohio meeting. They are as follows:
1. The American Society invites the whole people to act against slavery. The Ohio Convention invites only a small fractional part even of the people of its own State. 
The Society invites all men and women to act in this work. The Convention invites only those who assume themselves to be �pious' men and women, if indeed it recognized women as having any business in Convention at all, of which we are not assured.
The Society invites all human beings to aid in over throwing slavery. The Convention invites only that small portion of human beings who are in the habit of saying�� Lord! Lord!�
The Society acts on the principle of equal brotherhood, seeking the cooperation of all in doing a right and just thing. The Convention acts on the principle of caste, refusing the cooperation, even in a right and just thing, of those who are not in the habit of saying�' Lord! Lord!' 
The Society seeks solely the benefit of the oppressed and enslaved, and welcomes all who will help them� for whatever reason. The Convention so plans and conducts its operations as to make its help of the slave work sidewise towards the help of the church, and refuses the partnership of all who do not share this divided allegiance.
The Society has no interested purpose to serve, no axe to grind, no Corporation to help forward, no interest in another department to be fortified by success in this department. The Convention is giving half it strength and three quarters of its enthusiasm not only to another interest, to a church, but to its own church, that conglomeration of sectarian bodies which utter their repetitions of� Lord! Lord!' with the� evangelical' inflection, and to whose interests the members of the Convention had first committed themselves. This is the first point of difference.
2. The American Anti-Slavery Society, having long ago vainly called upon the American church to use its immense power for the help of the slave, and having proved it guilty of inhumanity, hypocrisy, and treachery to its own professions, and proved also that its alliance with slavery is the main bulwark of the wickedness, has ever since distinctly proclaimed the guilt of that church. The Ohio Convention (if the Independent has given a fair abstract of its proceedings) covers up that guilt with silence, thus giving additional proof that it is acting more in the interest of the church than in that of the slave.
It thus appears that the American Anti-Slavery Society and the Ohio Christian Anti-Slavery Convention agree exactly in what is to be said about slavery itself; agree exactly in the principles and the methods of direct opposition to it, saying that it is to be treated as one of the greatest sins against God, and one the greatest crimes against man. It further appears that the men and women of the Society have been steadily doing for the last quarter of a century why! the (self-styled) Christians of the Convention have just begun to do. And it appears, lastly, that the differences of principle and of action existing between these two bodies are such as to show a more sincere, single-hearted and thorough opposition to slavery the part of the former than of the latter. Yet the Independent has for many years been persistently calumniating the former as infidels, and making the grossest misrepresentations of their character and action, while it now assumes the Ohio Convention to be Christians, and conspicuously publishes the account of their meeting as an important and praiseworthy movement, and moreover as a Christian movement. 
Can the Independent tell us, will it tell us, without a intermixture of falsehood, why it makes this distinction and whether it echoes the claim of the Ohio Convention to be considered Christian chiefly because its members have begun to make vigorous opposition to sins against God and crimes against man, or chiefly because they have joined the Presbyterians, Congregationalists or Methodists in their peculiar manner of saying�' Lord! Lord!'�C K.W. 
PERSONAL. The New York Tribune says that dinner was given to Mrs. Stowe, previous to her departure for Europe, at the Revere House, Boston, by the Atlantic Club, we believe. She accepted the invitation on condition that wine should be prohibited Prof. Stowe, Miss P���, and Mr. J. Q. Whittier were also of the party. The table was <illegible> of wine until the invited guests departed, when, we understand, the� mocker' was brought on, proving that the whole thing was no better than a farce the part of the Club, which appears to be as <illegible> in the matter of wine-bibbing as it is intellectual �n its endowment Shame!

AN AFFECTING LETTER
DEAR MR. GARRISON:
While recently making the customary arrangements for a course of Anti-Slavery lectures, and other labor, in the State of Maine, by Miss HOLLEY and Miss PUTNAM, I received the following letter. I was so much interested and touched by its contents, that I cannot refrain from asking you to publish it, (suppressing names,) in the Liberator. As a faithful, life-long, (and perhaps dying) testimony to the sacredness and greatness of the cause, which the Liberator has so long and so faithfully upheld, I should not feel justified in keeping it as a more private note; and I hope that the lady, to whom my letter was addressed, and her sister who replies,-will in the circumstances pardon the unlooked-for publicity.�S. M. 
�, (Me.) Aug. 11, 1859.
SAMUEL MAY, JR.
DEAR SIR,�Yours of August 6th, proposing a lecture in this place, by Miss HOLLEY, was received last evening.
Miss - -, to whom the letter is addressed, is my sister. She is, at this time, very sick, and in all probability near the close of her life. I have read the letter to her this morning. She seemed very much affected by it, and desired me to say to you, that if she were well, this announcement would have given her great joy; that she can now only desire and pray for the success of the cause, and the seal and encouragement of its advocates. This she will continue to do as long as consciousness remains.
She has been a subscriber, and constant reader, and earnest defender of the Liberator for twenty-five years past, and in all that time has been, and still is, its only friend and defender in the place. Its names, its motto, its statements, are all to her familiar household words; and, during a trying illness of five months, while I have been in constant attendance upon her, the unabated zeal and love of her favorite subjects have surprised me. Her mind is becoming clouded� her reason waning�but she sees anathemas upon the walls of her chamber against the perpetrators of the accursed slave-trade, and in her moments of exhaustion, pities the tired laborers in the Anti-Slavery field.
With repeated assurances of her sympathy, and her regret that there seems no interest here to warrant the appointment of a meeting for Miss HOLLEY, I am, very truly, your friend,
MEETING IN JOY STREET CHURCH. 
On Tuesday evening last, Rev. Henry H. Garnet, President of the African Civilization Society, was announced to speak in advocacy of the same,�answer questions, &c., at the Joy Street Church in this city. 
Though the subject, pro and con, has been before the colored citizens of Boston at many meetings, and a large majority have no sympathy with the movement as understood by them, yet a full house was present to hear the President define his position.
Previous to this, Rev. J. S. Martin introduced a resolution, complimentary to Mr. Garnet's past exertions in the cause of humanity,-which he urged the adoption of by the meeting.
But as several dissented from such action at that stage of the meeting, it was withheld, and Mr. Garnet proceeded with his remarks�interrupted, occasionally, by questions and corrections which pressed themselves upon various individuals; during which, and after he had finished his main. speech, a sharp controversy, involving personalities, ensued, and noise and disorder reigned supreme.
Rev. J. S. Martin again urged his resolution, intimating that it was not offered as an endorsement of the African Civilization Society, but only as an expression which he thought due to Mr. Garnet.
Among those dissenting was Mr. Edward Garrison Walker, of Charlestown, who deprecated it, because the public would accept it as endorsing the African Civilization Society, which he placed in the same category with the American Colonization Society. Amid great confusion, the question was put, and the resolution declared adopted.
During Mr. Garnet's remarks, he charged that the recent New England Convention of Colored Citizens had two objects in view, viz: To denounce the African Civilization Society and�himself�a statement wholly at variance with the truth, and so pronounced in the meeting by Win. C. Nell, in behalf of the Convention Committee.
Whatever good may result to the individuals prominent in this African civilization movement, or to those persons sustaining business relations between this country and Africa, (to which, of course, no one can object,) suffice it to say that the present aspect of; the question is a most vexatious and distracting one to the colored people, creating dissentions among them and diverting their activities and means from what should be cardinal with them�the abolition of Slavery in the United States, and the elevation a; home of Colored Americana. W. C. N.

ANTI-SLAVERY IN MANCHESTER.
MANCHESTER, (N. H.) Aug. 28th, 1859.
FRIEND GARRISON:�This has been a day not to b forgotten by the friends of Liberty here, and I think its. enemies will be quite likely to remember it.
There was a large gathering on Merrimack Square, at five o'clock this afternoon, to hear our friends, Dr. J. M. HAWKS and A. T. Foss, on American Slavery The number present was estimated at between two and three thousand. Dr. H. is a new hand in the lecturing field; he is an earnest, candid man, an will do good service in the cause. He spoke of the antagonism that had always existed between liberty and oppression; he said that the question at issue in every battle had been in relation to the amount of liberty a people were entitled to. The cause of all the difficulty in settling the question has been that people have adopted and worked by a false rule, viz: that �might makes right.' This is the motto of our government in its dealing with the African race. If we would work by the Golden Rule, these question could be easily settled. He spoke in fitting terms of our pledge to help keep the slave in his chain, and the infamous slave law, and the revival of the Africa slave trade.
Mr. Foss followed, in an eloquent speech of nearly an hour's length, filled with stirring appeals to the reason, the sense of justice, and the emotions of the audience. All who happened to be passing that way were attracted by the subject, or the novelty of the occasion, and none went away until the speaker had finished. His strong denunciations of evil-doers in high places, both in Church and State, brought out no attempt at a reply, although liberty was given any one to do so from the beginning. Mr. F. urged the necessity of passing the Personal Liberty Law in this State, and spoke also of its recent defeat, and of Speaker Bryant's flunkeyism and meanness.
I am unable to do justice to the speeches; besides, Mr. Foss is too well known to need anything from my humble pen.
This evening, Miss EMMA HOUSTON, S trance medium, spoke in the Court Room Hall; it was well filled with an intelligent audience. She is a fine speaker, and was listened to with marked attention.
Where are the clergy, and the new organisation of 1840, who were going to take the Anti-Slavery cause into their own hands, and put a stop to the public speaking of women? If such ministers were ever friends of the slave, would not the poor panting fugitive say, 'God deliver me from my friends!' Would to God that the millions who are now following those of blind guides, could have the scales taken from their eyes. Then, me thinks, such evils as Capital Punishment, War, Slavery, and a thousand others which curse the family of man, would be done away with.
That angel spirits may strengthen you, and all who are striving to redeem the world, is the prayer of Your humble friend,
R. H. OBER. 
<c05>
THE TROUSSEAU OF A �SLAVE BRIDE.'
An article under this head was published some time since in the Journal of Commerce, as �proof of the condition of slaves in Georgia.' It was quite suited to the character and calibre of that paper. Suppose that its profound and conscientious conductor should show that a sheep is better clothed than any other creature, which he is doubtless well qualified to do having worn sheep's clothing so long, it would not follow that the condition of s sheep is good for beings �made a little lower than the angels.' It is said that the richest man in Russia is a serf, therefore, serf age is good, according to the highest standard known to the Journal. It seems, however, that Alexander II does not think so; and his father Nicholas and uncle Alexander I. were so far from that opinion, that they emancipated several millions of serfs. Each of them would have totally abolished slavery in Russia, had it not been for the opposition of the nobility. At this time, when the young Emperor is said to be meditating the consummation of the wise and humane policy of his predecessors, a mercenary Yankee editor would probably be highly appreciated, and more richly rewarded by the pro-slavery nobility of Russia, than the Journal of Commerce is likely to be by its Southern patrons; for those people are apt to apt but one side of a contract. If this hint should induce such a Yankee to� leave his country� for his own and �his country a good,' he shall be welcome the suggestion.
To the lady slave-driver, who so prettily describes that wonderful� trousseau,' I should like to propound a question or two:
1. What does she know of� the trousseaus' and �dresses' of� �decent Northern mechanics?�
2. Did the slave's trousseaus of �seven dresses,' �shawl,' �bottle of cologne,' and other articles more necessary,' embrace an order to the overseer that he should strip off none of those �dresses' for the purpose of cutting up the back beneath, or��� for a worse purpose?
3. Did it contain any guarantee that the bride should not be torn from her partner during the honeymoon, or sold to a stranger in a strange land?
4. Did the marriage ceremony contain the formula, �What God hath joined together, let not man put asunder�?
5. Is not a tow chemise, with the shives in it, considered a �dress� for a plantation bride?
The whole country has heard of the finery which their owners sometimes hang out on the scarred and degraded bodies of their poor slaves, and of the money they make jingle in the poor creatures' pockets, when they have it in hand to do a Northern doughface. I have been told that such a trick was once tried on Mr. Giddings. A slave was brought to his presence, genteelly dressed, and with a handful of gold and silver coin in his pocket, and full permission granted to the champion of freedom to put the� boy� through any course of interrogatories he pleased, and send him to a free State, if he wanted to go. The result happened according to order. The slave praised massa, professed to be delighted with his situation, said the coin was his own, that he always had as much as he wanted, that he didn't want his freedom, and wouldn't take it. This seemed to end the affair. It was pronounced a triumph of the South by the late� brave and Honorable Brooks,' as your chivalrous Burlingame was pleased to characterize that creeping assassin.
But the old anti-slavery campaigner was not to be beat by such tactics. He contrived to have an interview without the knowledge or presence of a third; person. Safe from accountability, and assured of; protection, the slave retracted all he had said, declared! that the money was given him to be jingled, and returned to his master under penalty of having �his brains blown right out.' Being better advised, he made a better use of it, and bought a through ticketon the U. G. R. R. OLD ABOLITIONIST.

THE OTHER SIDE.
DEAR GARRISON:
I have just finished a conversation with Rev. Mr. Pope, the Universalist minister of Hyannis, respecting the case of the poor fellow that was sent back by Capt. Crowell to the hell of American slavery. This recreant man is a respected member of Mr. Pope's Society. The pastor vouches for the good Christian' character of this mean bloodhound. I told Mr. P. that if this infamous captain had done this act to his [Mr. P's] child, or wife, he would have no more respect for him than he would for a pirate.
His reply was, that we are unable to judge the motives of this excellent young man, who did what he felt to be his duty; that the Abolitionists had lied about the matter, and grossly misrepresented the whole affair. For instance, they had reported that the slave was chained to the capstan, and this he says is false�for he formerly owned part of the vessel, and there is no capstan, and never was. Again, it is charged that the captain paid $500 for the carrying back of the slave, whereas it was only $200. And, more seriously, an Abolitionist is now an owner of this vessel, and took part of the money, and put it in his pocket. Shame on the hypocrite, if this is so. And, farther, Mr. Pope says that a leading Garrisonian Abolitionist in Hyannis knew the slave was board, might have taken him, and Capt. Crowell would have rejoiced to have been rid of discharging a disagreeable duty. The public are deceived in this matter, and the other side has not been fairly met.
Such is part of the defence put forth by a minister for his parishioner. Let him have the full benefit of it. What marvel that infidelity is preferred to a Christianity that can kidnap men, and then talk of Christ, sanctification and heaven!
Friend Garrison, I am sick at heart with such stuff. Let us unmask and expose this canting hypocrisy, from high Calvinism down to the same �gone to seed,' and save, if possible, deluded souls who ask for �bread, and get a stone; for a fish, and get a serpent.'
Milford, Aug. 25, 1859. G. W. S.

SALLIE HOLLEY IN MAINE.
BROTHER GARRISON:
As soon as I received notice of the appointment of the meeting of Sallie Holley in Buxton, Aug.16, I sent notice thereof to the Baptist, Free-will Baptist, and the two self-styled Orthodox ministers, requesting them to read them to their congregations. The Baptist minister come where I was, and cheerfully took the notice, came where I was, and cheerfully took the notice, and read it to his congregation, and came to the meeting, and took a seat on the platform, apparently without fear of losing his reputation, or bread and butter. The Free-Will Baptist minister read the notices to his congregation, but came not to the meeting. As to the Orthodox ministers, whether they received notices or not, I cannot tell. I have learned, upon inquiry, that one of them read I have learned, upon inquiry, that one of them read no such notice.
The meeting was held in the Grove at Buxton Centre depot, was a complete success�far the most numerous and successful Anti-Slavery meeting ever held in Buxton. For an hour and a half, Miss Holley held audience in rapt attention by the sincere and heart-felt truths she uttered. The people seemed taken by surprise. Instead of a declaiming female fanatic, they met one had a message God unto them �one in whom was treasured up more of the gospel of Jesus than they had heard for Years. Even the youth were affected deeply by her truthful words. The subject matter was just what the people needed, and what has done them good. Expect a few old political fogies, who believe that slaveholding and pro-slavery voters can be good Christian church members, none found fault. Well, if any are given over to hardness of heart and blindness of mind, they are the ones.
There was a great amount of prejudice against female speaking that found a grave that day, which will
<c06>
not be soon resuscitated; and I have since learned that many more would have been there, if they had heard of the meeting. Should it be convenient for her to come again, and I could have timely notice, I could gather a grand company.
I speak generally when I say, that our religions bodies have not the cause at all at heart, not even the common feelings of humanity, touching the question of slavery. Sallie Holley and caroline Putnam are two noble, self-sacrificing women; and none, expect those in like circumstances know the trails of such a calling as theirs. But they are called of God, and he will sustain his chosen.

LETTER FROM MISS PUTNAM.
SOUTH BRIDGTON, (Me.)Aug.22, 1859.
DEAR MR. GARRISON: At our leave-taking is Boston, you were kind enough to say some memoranda of what should befal us in Maine would please you for the Liberator. To begin not with the creation, as Mr. Irving and Mrs. Stowe say is necessary, but with the hour when we parted with you on the Lewiston.
The twilight was long enough for us to watch from the deck our course out of the harbor, and beyond the last light, when the moon broke through the clouds, and sent down her beams in that magical path which lights up the sea with such enchantment. The after a passage tranquil enough to have been made on the Pacific, instead of the boisterous Atlantic ocean. It was indeed one of the halcyon nights, for did not the days of that marvellous bird include moonlight nights? Our kind friend Mr. Newell A. Foster met us with cordial welcome, and on sunday morning and evening, two largely attended meetings were held is Mechanics' Hall, according to his arrangement. He expresses his gratification at the interest that has, been awakened by these lectures, and remarked,� It is the best Anti-Slavery meeting held here for years.' Is the evening, the Rev. Mr. Frothingham lent a brave testimony to the excellence nobleness of the Anti-Slavery struggle.
The revival of the Foreign Slave Trade has been a newspaper topic in Portland for the last week. A suspicious vessel named The Newsboy has just fitted out at his port, nominally for the Azores, �but it is believed her Portuguese captain and foreign crew are not strangers to the horrors of that traffic, so long the source of all unutterable woe to the poor Africans. What a terrible fact it is that pirate ships can nestle securely in Northern harbors!
Through the efforts of Mr. Peter Libby, Known for so many years to the Abolitionists as Maine Vice, President of the American Anti-Slavery society, a fine meeting was gathered, last Tuesday, in a sweet spot which Nature has crowned with a lovely grove temple. It was a delightful afternoon, and the fresh, healthful air and cheerful sunshine conspired with the eloquent Anti-Slavery Word to gin us life more abundantly.
The assembly listened with respectful and east attention to the great truths of Freedom and justice which are of such vital concern to every human being. It was truly an impressive scene, these two hundred farmers and their families pausing in the busy harvest farmer and their time to hear an appeal made for their enslaved countrymen. We trust the convictions of that hour may help to swell the rising tide of public opinion, which shall by and by become irresistible, and utterly overwhelm slavery. To what most honorable service is the Anti-Slavery agent call this of strengthening a nation's virtue, and arousing it to effectual conflict with the deadliest enemy of humanity! What nobler enthusiasm can possess the soul of the patriot, the philanthropist, the Christian?
Saturday afternoon, the stage sat us down door of an honored friend of the slave, the Rev. Joseph P. Fessenden, in South Bridgton. A benediction seemed to rest upon the house, as it always where the good man dwells.
Mrs. Fessenden came out to welcome us with a sweet cordiality, and presently took us in to see her husband, whom we were sorry to find upon a sick couch, much wasted by a severe illness; but his eyes was bright with intelligence and feeling, as he spoke to us of his nearly finished work, and the joy and the comfort he had in the reflection that beginning he heartily espoused the cause of the slave, and had been able to stand through great trails almost alone in his defence. The next (.Sunday) afternoon, the meeting-house where this faithful minister has preached these many years was filled with an eager audience, that listened with evident satisfaction to Miss Holley's discourse. What a saving influence the Orthodox Church might have been in the land, if every pulpit had held such an honest lover of righteousness as Mr. Fessenden!
This part of the State is parched with drought there having been no considerable rain since the third day of July; but the Bridgton farms seem great and handsomer than any others we have seen, Here, too gets an alluring view of the distant White Mountains. C. F. P.

WRONG NUMBERING.
FRIENS GARRISON � I have just noticed a serious error in the numbering of the Liberator. The paper for Nov. 12th, 1858, is numbered 1456, the next paper 1567, adding 111 on one week! Thence the wrong numbering continues, and this week's paper is 1606, instead of 1495, which it should be. You will see that as this is number 34 of the 29th, volume, it could not be 1606, whole number, unless is 24 of the preceding volumes there had been 56 numbers each, and in four, 57 each. But call this number 1495, and the twenty-eigth preceding volume will have allowed them 1461 papers, which is exactly the number of weeks, as I reckon, in 28 years, and 53 to each of five years, If the paper has come out every week, in 28 years, it would have five volumes of 53 numbers each. So, next week's should be 1496, instead of 1607.
Yours, truly, C. C. BURLEIGH.
Thanks to our friend BURLEIGH for his vigilance in detecting a blunder, which, having been made, was likely to be perpetuated to the end of the volume. The proper correction has been made in our present number: the past is irretrievable �[Ed. Lib.

TEMPERANCE LECTURES �Mr. G. W. CALEFT, like Gough was once connected with the stage, but for a year or two past a successful and eloquent advocate of the Temperance cause, �contemplates giving a lecture or two in a short time, at Tremont Temple, in this or two in a short time, at Tremont Temple, in this city, of which due notice will be given in the daily papers. Wherever he has lectured, Mr. CALEVY has received the warm commendations of the daily press, Notwithstanding some have been unkindly plotting his ruin, and by slanderous inuendoes seeking to discourage and crush him, he smiles at it all, and still perseveres. The New York Tribune says� he has won distinction in his calling,' and urges a liberal attendance upon his lectures. The New Haven Journal and Courier says,� Mr. C. is a fine and forcible speaker, possessing in an eminent degree the power of imitation, which with sad experience with the� silken saloons' of our cities, renders his lectures very impresaive, as well as entertaining.' Dr. JEWETT, editor of The Temperance Alliance, expresses a very favorable opinion of him. As Mr. C. has abandoned the stage, and refuses tempting offers to return to it, and as he depends mainly upon his labors in the cause of Temperance for his support, he ought to be warmly encouraged by all who are interested in promotion of that beneficent movement. It is to be hoped that parents and the principal leaders in Reform will seek him out, and give him an opportunity to attack the Bacchanalian strongholds in this city. He sings and improvises German and Italian Operas to show how even classically educated young men are entrapped.

THE RIGHT DECLARATION BELOW.
OHIO, August 25, 1859.
DEAR GARRISON:
My eye has this moment seen what purports to be the Declaration of Sentiments adopted by the Plymouth Convention, as it is contained in my letter to the Liberator from Plymouth. That is not the Declaration that was reported to and adopted by the Convention, either in its words or sentiments. I could not have consented to have reported or to have advocated and voted for such a Declaration as the one embodied in my letter. Enclosed is a true copy of what was adopted. I send it, lest you should not have one at hand. As the spurious Declaration is published in the Liberator, you will greatly oblige me and many others by inserting the true Declaration as it was adopted. You will see the wide difference between the two.[1]
A week ago last Sunday, I was in a tent, on the sea-shore in Quincy, and there worshipped God with my friends. Last Sunday, I was seven hundred miles west, in Geneva, Ohio. Shall remain in Ohio, Western New York, and in Michigan, till after the Yearly Meeting of the Friends of Progress, to be held in Ann Arbor, Mich., the 23d, 24th and 25th of September; then the first Sunday in October,(the 2d day,) I am to be in Portland, Me.
I have just learned that, on the day I was on the sea-shore, Dr. Cordelia L. Smalley, whom, for many years, I have known as the true and tried friend of the slave, passed from the corporeal to the incorporeal state. I cannot say that in her decease the slave has lost a friend, for I do not believe it. Would any one say of the disciples, concerning the death of Jesus, that they had lost their friend? So taught not Jesus. Though I go away, I will come again, and be ever near you, to comfort and sustain you,' was his teaching. So of Dr. C.L. Smalley; though, like Jesus, she has left the body, she is still here, to sympathize with and befriend the slave, and all who are in affliction, and will be with them as a comforter, so long as there are those here who need her help.
HENRY C. WRIGHT.
[1] It was our mistake, copied from another paper,ED.LIB.
DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS.
While this Convention claims no authority to construct a creed for Spiritualists, or to adopt tests of fellowship for any sectarian purpose, yet, in view of the manifold mistakes and persistent misrepresentations of anti-Spiritualists, both in public and in private, in press and in pulpit, its members feel called upon to exercise the manifest right of defining their own position, and setting forth their own sentiments, in so far as they profess to have any agreement.
We therefore adopt the following statement as representing the views of this Convention on the topics therein specified.
I. WHO ARE SPIRITUALISTS?
We recognize as Spiritualists, according to the now common use of the term, all who hold to the one fact that human spirits, having a conscious personal existence after the death of their physical bodies, can and do manifest themselves, and communicate to those in the body, under suitable conditions.
Beyond this, on questions of Philosophy, Morals, Theology, Reform, etc., we profess no full agreement, and take no responsibility for each other's opinions or acts. We expect to see alike in these matters, only as we arrive at like states of mental and spiritual growth. 
<illegible>, we regard ourselves as entitled to the name of Spiritualists, in its full sense, only as we adopt and practise sentiments which are truly spiritual in their nature and tendency,that is, refined, purifying and elevating.
II. WHAT IS SPIRITUALISM?
In its modern and restricted sense, Spiritualism may mean nothing more than the mere fact of spirit-existence and intercourse. But the term is also often applied to a system of Philosophy or Religion, based upon this cardinal fact. When thus applied, we would define it as follows: Spiritualism embraces all truth relating to man's spiritual nature, capacities, relations, duties, welfare and destiny; also, all that is known or to be known relative to other spiritual beings, and to the occult forces and laws of the universe. It is thus catholic and all-comprehensive.
We deem this department of truth, however, to be as yet partially understood by even the most capacious minds on earth; and hence, wide differences of opinion exist among Spiritualists as to its details. Each individual is expected to form his or her own conclusions, according to the evidences presented to the individual mind.
In accepting modern evidences bearing on this subject, we do not necessarily reject the ancient. Hence it is no part of Spiritualism to deny or affirm the truth or authority of the Bibleeach Spiritualist being at liberty to place his own estimate upon the value of that, and of all other ancient records.
Spiritualism, therefore, should not be confounded with the 'Harmonial Philosophy,' so-called, of Andrew Jackson Davis; nor with the religious opinions of Dr. Hare; nor with the individual theories of any other writer, however prominent among Spiritualists; nor even with the teachings of disembodied spirits themselves, inasmuch as these appear to differ as widely in their opinions as do spirits in the body. None of these are recognized by us as authoritative teachers,though each may have some truth, and that truth belongs to Spiritualism.
But, while we undertake not to define Spiritualism in all its details, we yet agree in affirming that its grand practical aim is, the quickening and unfolding of the spiritual or divine nature shall be subordinated, and all evil and disorderly affections rooted outin other words, that the 'works of the flesh' may be supplanted in each individual by the 'fruits of the spirit,' and thus mankind become a Brotherhood, and God's will be done on the earth as it is in the heavens.
Hence we most emphatically declare that no theory or practice which tends to abrogate moral distinctions, to weaken the sense of personal responsibility, or to give a loose rein to animal desires, by whomsoever taught or received, can with any propriety be considered a part of Spiritualism.
III. RELATION OF SPIRITUALISM TO SPECIFIC REFORMS.
Since man's spiritual welfare in this and the after life is intimately connected with his conduct, his habits, his occupations and surroundings, as well as his beliefs and motives of life, we recognize all questions relating to Human Improvement and Practical Reform as legitimately embraced in Spiritualism.Hence, as earnest and consistent Spiritualists, we cannot fail to take a deep interest in all wise and well directed efforts for such objects as the following:
1st. Physiological Reform in generalincluding Temperance, Dietetic, Anti-Tobacco, and Dress Reformto the end that our bodies may be made the most fit and useful habitations and instruments for the spirit.
2d. Educational Reformthat body, mind, and spirit may be unfolded healthfully and harmoniously, in accordance with their own laws, and by the use of the most enlightened methods.
3d. Parentage Reformthat every child may be secured its rights to a healthful and well-balanced organization, and an introduction to life under favorable conditions.
4th. The Emancipation of Woman from all legal and social disabilities, that she may fulfil her noblest mission, and be fitted to become the mother of noble offspring, as she cannot while a menial and a slave.
5th. The Abolition of Slavery, whether chattel, civil, mental or spiritualbecause freedom is the birth-right of man, and the indispensable condition of his best development.
6th. The establishment of universal Peacebecause contention, violence, and bloodshed are the offspring of animalism, contrary to the dictates of Brotherhood, and opposed to man's spiritual progress.
7th. Theological and Ecclesiastical Reformbecause belief in error, and subjugation to authority, are unfriendly to human progress.
8th. Social Reform and Re-organization on the Principles of Brotherhoodbecause the present antagonistic and selfish relations of society are averse to man's highest welfare, and fail to meet the wants of his unfolding spiritual nature.
Lastly, in every other effort, general and specific, which commends itself to our individual judgments as tending to elevate and spiritualize mankind.
IV. ORGANIZATION.
While we would carefully abstain from combinations for any improper purpose, such as that of limiting individual freedom, controlling each other's opinions, or avoiding personal responsibility; yet we affirm the propriety and the desirableness of association on the part of those who agree, for proper objects. Among the objects which we deem proper are, the affording of mutual aid and encouragement in a true lifethe promotion of fraternal intercourse, and interest in each other's welfareand co-operation for the public advocacy of what are deemed important truths and needed reforms. Such associations, in order to be harmonious and effective, should be based on a mutual recognition of vital truths, cautiously avoiding any attempt to set bounds to inquiry, or limits to mental progress.
<c02>
BLONDIN AT THE FALLSHE CARRIES A MAN ACROSS. 
The disbelieved statements and promises of M. Blondin, that he would cross Niagara Falls on Wednesday last with a man on his back, have been fulfilled to the letter. On that day he carried M. Colcord, his agent, from the Canada to the American shore, in presence of many thousands of spectators. Let no one ever again doubt the power of Blondin to do any thing on earth. If he promises to cross the rope, and wind it up after him as he goes along, or to climb a ten foot pole and draw it up; go ten feet higher, believe him, for he will do it. If he engages to cross on the rope, equipped like the 'Zouave' who yesterday paraded our streets playing on the violin, drum, cymbals and bell at one and the same time, with enough baggage on him to load down a camel, and engages to play upon all the instruments while he hangs to the rope with his teeth, turns backward somersaults, &c, never for a moment doubt his ability to do it.
But to the performance of Wednesday. It is difficult to decide which had the more courage, Blondin or Colcord. The Buffalo Express of yesterday morning says:
Blondin first crossed from the American side alone, performing during the passage most of the daring feats described in our account of his crossing on the 2d inst. After a short rest on the Canadian shore, he started upon his return, with M. Colcord, his agent, clinging to his back. From his shoulders two looped cords were suspended by his side, in which the legs of the daring rider were swung, while his arms were clasped about Blondin's neck. His position was such that, at the distance from shore to shore, he could hardly be seen, and when the adventurers started upon their terrible journey, bets were freely exchanged among the spectators on this side as to whether Blondin was alone or accompanied according to programme. He stepped out so briskly and firmly that it seemed impossible that his back was freighted with a living load. But as he advanced, the rider became more clearly distinguished, and while all doubts disappeared, the trembling anxiety of the lookers on was painfully increased. About an eighth of the distance was travelled without any hall or sign of fatigue. Then Blondin came to a stop, and Colcord slipping his legs from their slings, dropped his feet upon the rope, and stood supporting himself with his hands upon Blondin's shoulders while the latter rested. The halt was perhaps of a moment's duration, when Colcord again mounted to his beat, regaining it apparently with the utmost ease, and acting with all the self-possession of Blondin himself. After this the halts and resting spells were frequent, the length of the journey and the weight of his load telling upon the iron nerve and muscle of Blondin. Several times the spectators were terrified by seeing the rope tremble and sway from some cause, and from apparent signs of exhaustion in Blondin. Whether these latter were assumed or real, it was impossible to say, but especially at the centre, where the rope is entirely clear and without guys, he shook and staggered in a manner to cause the stoutest nerved among the spectators to shudder and turn pale. The latter half of the journey was performed with fewer rests than the first, and the last stage was one of almost desperate length, and Blondin reached the end of his terrible trip by an almost superhuman effort of determined will. When he was fairly upon terra firma, the pent up excitement of the crowd burst forth in deafening cheers and the wildest demonstrations, and the two heroes, Blondin and Colcord, were seized and born away upon the shoulders of the crazy multitude.
COOKING AN OMELET OVER THE NIAGARA.On Wednesday, Mono. Blondin endeavored to keep up the excitement about his tight-rope feats by taking a stove out upon his rope and cooking an omelet. The Buffalo Express gives a description of the amusing performance: 
'After a stay of fifteen or twenty minutes upon the Canadian shore, he started back with a cook stove swung upon his back, the culinary appurtenances thereto consisting of a saucepan, ladle, sundry dishes and a pair of bellows securely fastened upon the stove. It must not be imagined that the stove he bore upon his back was a full-sized cast iron 'Victor,' neither must it be fancied a miniature affaira disguised spirit lump - chafing dish. It was a goodly sized, properly-fashioned cooking-stove, made of Russia sheet-iron, and boasting of a smoke-pipe about two feet in height. 
Arrived at the centre of the rope, Blondin secured his pole and proceeded with nonchalance to make preparations for 'camping.' Unslinging his stove, he placed it upon the rope before him, sat down, and with some pitchy, combustible material built his fire, exciting it with the bellows, and soon raising a smoke which proved the genuiness of the preparations for cooking. When a proper degree of heat had been attained, he produced his eggs, broke them into his dish, and threw the shells into the river. The omelet was prepared with all the skill of a chef de cuisine, and when it was complete, he lowered it to the deck of the Maid of the Mist, where, we doubt not, it was divided into the smallest possible shares, and eagerly treasured by the passengers. Gathering up his hotel,' Blondin readjusted it upon his back, and quickly landed himself and it upon the American shore, amid the loud cheers of the throng.' 
TEMPERANCE CONVENTION AT ATHOL. 
A Temperance Convention was held in Athol, Worcester county, last week. There was a large attendance from all the towns in North Worcester county. Mr. Lyman W. Hapgood, of Athol, was chosen President, and F. F. Fay, Secretary. Addresses were delivered by William Adams, Jr., Edwin Thompson, Geo. H. Hoyt, F. F. Fay, of Athol, and others. 
The following resolutions, offered by Mr. Hoyt, were discussed, and finally adopted. It will be seen that the letter of Wendell Phillips to Chief Justice Shaw and President Walker was unequivocally endorsed: 
Resolved, That the temperance men of the North Worcester district are firm in their allegiance to the cause, and strong in their faith in the efficacy of the prohibitory law. 
Resolved, That we hail with satisfaction the refusal of the Legislature of 1859 to change or modify existing laws against the rum traffic. 
Resolved, That the indulgence in intoxicating beverages, common among men representing the State of Massachusetts in high official stations, is offensive to ' its highest moral purpose,' as expressed on its statute book, and calls for our unqualified censure and denunciation. 
Resolved, That the recent letter of a prominent friend and advocate of the cause, to the Chief Justice of Massachusetts and the President of Harvard University, challenges the admiration of the people, and has the hearty sanction of all who care to see a proper administration of the laws of the Commonwealth, and a pure example set before the youth of her educational institutions. 
Resolved, That the new organization of the friends of temperance into a 'State Alliance' meets our approval, and we bid it a hearty God-speed' in me work. 
The Convention was spirited and successful.
We copy the following paragraph from 'The Temperance Alliance, 'a new, handsomely printed, and spicy monthly journal, published at No. 11 Cornhill Boston, as the official organ of the Massachusetts State Temperance Alliance, and edited by the eloquent and veteran advocate of the Temperance cause, Dr CHARLES JEWETT:
ALL RIGHT.The letter of Wendell Phillips, Esq. to Judge Shaw and President Walker, which will be found on the first page, has been replied to, and in connection with that reply, we must concede that propriety or the fitness of things has been consulted. The author of the reply is understood to be a dilapitated* clergyman, now in the Custom House, who has earned his present position by a succession of moral somersets, which has truly astonished beholders, and which we predict will forever put it out of his power to advocate rum-selling and the African slave trade from a New England pulpit. His production is worthy of its origin, and found an appropriate place in the columns of the Boston Morning Post, which from the year thirty-seven, to the present hour, has been the sturdy opponent of a prohibitory law. We have no doubt that both the learned and venerable men addressed by Mr. Phillips were made sad by the vivid picture of their own inconsistency, drawn in the letter of their earnest friend. We have as little doubt that their sadness will be increased by the knowledge of their present real misfortune in being thus defended. A distinguished satirist once said of a certain class of persons,
'Their praise defames, as if a fool should mean, 
By spitting in your face, to wash it clean.'

BALLOON TRIP. Prof. Steiner, the aeronaut, ascended in his balloon Europa, at Toronto, at half-past 4 in the afternoon of the 25th ult., and landed at half-past 9 in the evening of the same day, eight miles south of Oswego, N. Y., having passed all the way over Lake Ontario.

'OUR SLAVE MARKET.' 
Under this disgraceful American head, the Richmond Enquirer practically-argues the question of the re-opening of the African Slave Trade, by quoting the high prices of Slaves in the domestic markets of that noted mart of human flesh, bones, sinews, and souls. It states that a bale of cotton and a 'likely nigger' are about well balanced in the scale of pecuniary appreciation, and talks about the prices of boys, girls, men, and women, just as heartlessly as hog and cattle dealers of beasts in the shambles. It says: 
In looking round at the slave sales in Richmond, made at the well known marts of Dickinson, Hill & Co., Pulliam, Betts & Co., Hector Davis, and others, we find that active negroes, likely families, as well as boys and girls command high prices, and there are several gentlemen in market who are purchasing for their own plantations in the South. 
For the benefit of our country and Southern readers, we will give below the state of our slave market and the average prices brought by slaves in Richmond: 
No. 1 men, 20 to 26 years old, from $1,450 to $1,500. 
Best plough boys, 17 to 20 years old, $1,350 to $1,425. 
Boys from 15 to 17 years old, $1,250 to $1,375. 
Boys from 12 to 15 years old, $1,000 to $1,200. 
Best grown girls, 17 to 20 years old, from $1,275 to $1,325. 
Girls from 15 to 17 years old, $1,150 to $1,250. 
Girls from 12 to 15 years old, $1,000 to $1,100. 
Of course, the quotations only represent the rates offered for the best class of slaves. The inferior grades are numerous, and command prices in accordance with the quality.
TWENTY-ONE SLAVES MANUMITTED.The canal packet 'John B. Rortle,' lying in the river above Broad street bridge, has on board twenty-one slaves, men and women, manumitted by the will of their late owner, Pleasant Burnet, of Mecklenburg county, Virginia. They are likely-looking men and women, and, with one exception, look forward with delight to the freedom and self-management in store for them. They are under the charge of Robert M. Hutchinson and Charles S. Hutchinson, who have selected lands in Hardin county, near Kenton, for their location, and for which they will take the train on the C. P. & Ind. R. R. this morning. The testator, Mr. Burnet, did not free all his slaves; only selecting those who had been faithful, and were deemed competent to care for themselves. Good lands have been selected for the negroes to settle upon, in accordance with the provisions of the will, and they will be furnished with all the necessary tools and implements to commence operations. God grant them success in their free homes!Ohio State Journal, Aug. 22.
A NEGRO ARRESTS A WHITE MAN AS A FUGITIVE SLAVE.We take the following from the Edwardsville (III.) Journal: 
'About 10 o'clock on Tuesday morning, a gentleman by the name of Isaac Dickson, (a carpenter,) who had advanced about eight miles from this place, along the Springfield road, on his way to Carlinville, was startled by the presentation at his head of a pistol, by one WM. Brown, a negro, living in this neighborhood. The surprised pedestrian was ordered, by his dusky assailant (who was aided by one Samuel Cobine, a white man), to submit to having his hands tied, and be marched back to this place, his doughty captors not vouchsafing any reason therefore. On arriving in town, the luckless traveler was informed that he was arrested as a runaway slave, for whom a reward of $200 had been offered. Fortunately, the prisoner met with residents here to whom he was not altogether a stranger, and on whose evidence he was releasedno doubt to the chagrin of his captors; the negro especially, who has aforetime fingered "filthy lucre," earned by the arrest of fugitives from the "peculiar institution," of his own color, and for aught we (or he, perhaps) know to the contrary, of his own blood and kin.
ELEVEN PERSONS MURDERED.A horrible tragedy has just been perpetrated in the small village of Wetzeargrun, Saxony, and a letter from Treven gives these rather incredible particulars: 
'Yesterday morning, the only wine-shop in the village, kept by a man named Zeltegrah, remained closed, to the great astonishment of the inhabitants, as during the present season, when the peasants go; early to work, it usually opened at daybreak. As the house still remained shut up all the morning, the Mayor of Wetzeargrun proceeded to the spot with a locksmith and two witnesses. He knocked severa times at the three doors of the house, and receiving no answer, had the front one opened. 
'To the great surprise of the Mayor and those with him, the shop was completely empty; even the two heavy counters, covered with zinc, had disappeared. He then pursued his investigations in other parts of the house, when a dreadful spectacle presented itself. All the inmates, eleven in number viz: the landlord, his wife, his three young children two female servants, a cellarman, a stableman, and two men who worked in the fields, were all found murdered. All of them had their bodies literally covered with wounds made by a sharp-pointed weapon; and handkerchiefs were tied tightly round the faces of the females, doubtless to prevent their screaming. The floors of the rooms where the bodies were found were covered with blood, partly coagulated, and in no part of the house was there to be found the smallest article of furniture. 
'The police were immediately sent in all direction to make inquiries, but up to this time no traces of the murderer have been discovered
DR. DOY AND CHARLEY FISHER. The Lawrence correspondent of the Tribune writes that Dr. Doy is at Lawrence, and although a reward is offered for him, no officer or other person dares to interfere wit! him. The Sheriff of St. Josephs was in the Territory but on the river. It would be dangerous for him to be man-hunting about Lawrence. 
Charles Fisher, the colored barber, whose rescue some months ago in Leavenworth caused much excitement, has since been entrapped, and carried to prison. He was flogged in the Missouri jail until his back was raw, and then sold down South.
GOOD RIDDANCE. John Mitchel, the Irish exile and convert to American despotism, has discontinued his Citizen, and transferred its few subscribers to the New York Day Book, the only out-and-out Buchanan organ in New York. Poor John, with a his devotion to slavery, and his fond aspirations for an ' Alabama plantation well stocked with fat niggers,' has finally been starved outended his career in disgrace, dishonored his native land, and returns home a libel upon the Irish name. Even slaveholders could not endure his sycophancy and toadyism and have spurned him from their presence as an un worthy and false representative of a noble race.-Northern Advocate.
FREE NEGROES TO BE IMPRISONED IN NEW ORLEANS.The following notice to all whom it may concern, appears in the editorial columns of the New Orleans Picayune of Sunday, Aug. 21: 
'The law enacted last winter by the Legislature of Louisiana, placing all free negroes under the most rigid surveillance, who may arrive in this State on shipboard or steamboats, goes into effect the 1st of September next. 
 All free persons of color, arriving in port from abroad, must immediately be lodged in jail, and remain there until the departure of the boat or vessel on which they came; masters of steamboats and ships must report to the Chief of Police all such persons belonging to their crews, or passengers, or incur severe penalties. 
It will be well for all masters of vessels and steam - boats trading with this State, to bear in mind the provisions of this law, as it will save them from much trouble, and perhaps pecuniary loss. The evils attending the increase of a free negro population, and more particularly the intercourse of free persons of color from abroad with our slaves, caused the passage of this stringent law.' 
The two candidates for Governor in Iowa-Gen. A. C. Dodge, Democrat, and J. S. Kirkwood, Republicanhad quite an exciting time in their debates at Oskaloosa. The following passage occurs in the report:
Mr. Kirkwood remarked that those present in the afternoon would remember that he had predicted that before long, the democracy would be urging the revival of the slave-trade, because slavery, as they would affirm, is a Christianizing institution. But, said he, I did not expect my competitor would commence so soon. This fair and legitimate inference drawn from General D.'s remarks on slavery, fairly roused the lion within him. 
As soon as Mr. K. sat down, General Dodge sprang to his feet, and declared savagely that if Mr. Kirkwood said that he or any of the democracy was in favor of the slave-trade, he was a liar, and that if he repeated it, he would cram the lie down his throat. 
Mr. K., perfectly calm and good-natured, waited until the General had relieved his choler somewhat, when he remarked that if General D. spoke figuratively in regard to cramming words down his throat, it was all right; but if he attempted it practically, it would be quite a different thing. 
General Dodge declared he was 'ready to give his antagonist satisfaction.'

THE TWENTY-SIXTH
NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY
SUBSCRIPTION-ANNIVERSARY;
IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY NEXT, IN BOSTON, 1860.
In a year when Americans find themselves citizens of a country where the African slave trade is going on, and slave-hunting unforbidden, and sheltering the fugitive indicted as a crime, and the leading religious and political influences so dead to this public shame as to discountenance legislative reform, we are confident that we have only to open our subscription in order to be becomingly and effectually sustained by the awakening virtue of the people, in the enterprise to which our lives are given.
We entreat, then, all the friends of Liberty, and the foes of Slavery, every where, in the South as at the North,in Europe as in America,philosophers as well as Christians, Catholics no less than Protestants, to subscribe to a fund and a mode of expenditure which prepares the way before every sect, every party, every association; which makes all other mens anti-slavery labors light; and which has, for six and twenty years, been laying the foundations of many generations, so as to exclude slavery from American institutions, and secure to posterity those blessings of liberty which the last generation passed away without enjoying.
THE UNDERSIGNED, while asking the favor of their subscribers company, on their customary Anniversary occasion, are impelled by the goodness and the grandeur of the enterprise,by its indispensable nature, by the universal and fundamental character of its principles,to entreat also the assistance of all. The crisis in the nations life makes the occasion: one which it will be worth crossing the ocean to participate in. And while thanking our European friends for their generous cooperation of last year with America, we ask its continuance yet a little longer; till a spirit of devotedness adequate to this great world-enterprise shall have been here awakened.
From this day forward through the year we begin to arrange our plans, organize our efforts, and economies our means, greater or smaller as the case may be, to meet this great national claim: and we desire all who would see slavery abolished, and truth, honor, peace, liberty and safety in righteousness restored, to meet us at its close, for cheer, counsel, sacrifice, resolve, and generous co-operation.

Senator Douglas on the African Slave Trade.Senator Douglns, of Illinois, writes a letter to a Virginian friend, asserting his hostility to the Cass doctrine of naturalization, and explaining the reason of his hostility to the re-opening of the African slave trade. The ground he takes against that nefarious movement is not predicated on sentiments of humanity, or any conviction of the immorality and injustice of the traffic, but on the fact that its suppression was one of the compromises of the Constitution.
Senator Albert G. Brown, of Mississippi, proclaimed in a recent speech, 'that the only hope of the Southern Democracy was to make a fight in the Charleston Conventionto go there determined to have their views incorporated in the creed of the party, or break up the concern in a row. He had no doubt, as they had heretofore controlled the party on all great questions, that the Northern free soil element would yield in graceful submission again.'
Horace Greeley writes from Big Sandy, Oregon, July 6, that white men with two or three squaws each are quite common throughout this region, and young and relatively comely Indian girls are bought from their fathers by white men as regularly and openly as Circassians at Constantinople. The usual range of prices is from $40 to $80about that of Indian horses. I hear it stated that, though all other trade may be dull, that in young squaws is always brisk on Green River and the North Platte.

The Mercer (Pa.) Luminary of Aug. 23, says: We have the particulars of a most terrible calamity which occurred near Red Bluff, on the Sacramento River, California, on the 12th of May last. The residence of Col. E. A. Stevenson, late Indian Agent, was set on fire by an Indian boy in his employ, early in the morning, and the entire family of Col. Stevenson, consisting of his wife and three children, together with the wife of a Mr. Kronk and two children, perished in the flames. The boy was instigated to the terrible deed by five Indians, in the absence of Col. Stevenson. Mrs. Stevenson was the daughter of the late Jonathan Marcy of Wilkesbarre, and the niece of the Rev. George C. Drake of this borough.
It is said that cockroaches are easily destroyed, simply by cutting up green cucumbers at night, and placing them about where these pests commit depredations. What is cut from the cucumbers, in preparing them for the table, answers the purpose just as well, and three applications will destroy all the roaches in the house. Remove the parings in the morning, and renew them at night.

FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE
PHILANTHROPIC CONVENTION.
At the Fifth Session of the First Philanthropic Convention, which was held at Utica, N. Y., in September, 1858, Mr. Giles B. Stebbins, of Rochester, offered the following resolution, which was unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That this Convention become an anniversary, of all who seek wisdom to overcome evil with good, and that the time, place, and arrangements for the text meeting be left to a Committee consisting of Ira S. Hitchcock, of Oneida, Dr. Robert T. Hallock and Andrew Jackson Davis, of New York, and Amos Rogers, of Utica.
In accordance with the above resolution, the Committee have completed arrangements for the First Anniversary of the Philanthropic Convention, to be held in St. James Hall, Buffalo, Erie County, on the 16th, 17th and 18th of September, 1859.
The Convention will open in St. James Hall, Buffalo, N. Y., on Friday, the 16th of September, 1859, at 10 oclock, A. M., and continue three days. The following persons, residents of Buffalo, constitute the Committee of Arrangements:
John N. Gardner, Cyrus O. Pool," George Whitcomb, Louise Whitcomb, Alanson Webster, Thomas Rathbun, Sarah Rathbun, E. A. Maynard, Mary F. Davis, J. H. Lusk, Giles Husted, Lester Brooks, W. G. Oliver, E. G. Scott, Benoni S. Brown.
Any member of this Committee can be addressed by those wishing to secure accommodation in advance, at Hotels and Private Boarding Houses. The Hall procured for this occasion is convenient and commodious, seating comfortably 2000 persons. The friends of Reform in Buffalo and vicinity, will do all in their power to entertain strangers, and to aid the objects of the Convention; and the locality of their beautiful city is so central, that Reformers from all quarters can reach it readily, and at small expense.
The Committee have made favorable terms with Wardss Line of Steamers, as follows: From Toledo to Buffalo and return, $4,00; from Sandusky and return, $3,50; from Cleveland and return, $2.00, (Meals and Berths included.) A corresponding reduction of fare for persons attending the Convention will probably be effected on the New York & Erie Railroad.
A Quartette Club of Singers is engaged to be present, and will enliven each session with appropriate music.
FREE INQUIRYRELIGIOUS REFORM.
To all sincere and earnest Seekers after Truth, of whatever name, sect, or party, or of no name, sect or party, is respectfully addressed the following invitation to meet at ELLENVILLE, Ulster Co., N. Y., on the 2d, 3d and 4th of September, 1859, in a Convention of Free Inquiry for the promotion of Religious Reform.
Under the term Religious Reform is meant to be included all reform pertaining to the civil and social welfare of Man; for the originators of this call are of the opinion that the religious clement in man is the leading element of his nature, and that its development has preceded, led and moulded every form of civilization that has yet appeared, and that it is destined to perform a like function in the future. Guizot has abundantly shown that Religious Reformation, in the civilization of Europe, has preceded every political and social reformation of the last eighteen centuries.
Now, if (in the language of Carlyle) the religion of a man be the chief fact of a man, and the key to his whole being, the true reformer can hope to succeed only so far as he calls in and relies upon the religious element in mans nature; and he can meet with no more potent obstacle than a perverted religious sentiment, or false and absurd religious maxims and dogmas.
The originators of this call are of the opinion that the unsoundness and corruption in politics and commerce, so widely felt and universally acknowledged, have their root in a similar unsoundness and corruption in the popular religions of the day.
When, from the sacred [?] desk, reason, the faculty that apprehends Religions truth, is decried, and Error, on the plea of utility, is boldly declared preferable to Truth, is it any wonder that the Higher Law is scoffed at, and universal corruption in commerce is not only tolerated, but advocated as a necessityand by some applauded as a virtue?
Besides set addresses at this Convention, due time will be allowed to conference, discussion, and the free expression of thought. Any person not able to favor us with his presence will confer a special favor by forwarding to the Committee any word of cheer, or any thought or sentiment suitable to be read on, the occasion. JOSEPH FOSTER, J. A. BLACK MON. M. DEPONAI, Committee of Arrangements.

OXYGENATED BITTERS.
A QUERY. Why will yon suffer? Dyspepsia is but a brief and comprehensiva term for the numerous diseases which affect the stomach, liver, and, in fact, the whole human system. Until Dr. Green discovered the Oxygenated Bitters, medical science was at fault, and had exhausted itself in fruitless efforts to cure this disease. The dyspeptic need suffer no longer with a disease that is always painful, and frequently a fatal affliction.
This unique and peculiar compound will as certainly cure the disease as the disease exists. Had it not this power, such testimony as follows would not be given in its favor:
VALUABLE TESTIMONY IN FAVOR OF THE OXYGENATED BITTERS.
WASHINGTON, (D. C.) June 10.
Having made use of the Oxygenated Bitters, prepared by Dr. George B. Green, of Windsor, Vt., and from knowledge obtained of their efficacy in other cases, we cheerfully recommend them to the public, believing they will fully sustain the recommendation of the proprietor. We hope that this valuable remedy may be accessible to all the afflicted.

LINES,
Written after reading Gajan's Romani Exile.
BY ANNA GARDNER.
O, fair Italia! with a lavish hand
Rich Nature gathers beauties to adorn
Thy crowded dells-and o'er thy fruitful land 
To pour her plenteous horn.
Crowned with a diadem of stately palms, 
Hill, Vale and grove in deepest verdure dressed,
Thou reign'st a queen in loving Nature's arms,
By limpid waves caressed.
Thou gifted land of peerless art and song!
How do thy memories the heart inspire! 
Thy Tasso's harp awake, and still prolong
Boccacios matchless lyre!
The glowing words of poet, prophet, sage, 
Like music through receding spheres of time,
Come sounding on from circling age to age,
In symphonies sublime!
Not all in vain thy utterances have been-
Not all in vain thy martyr heart hath bled-
The tree of liberty, now withering,
With life-blood shall be fed!
And for the healing of thy country's woes,
Its emerald leaves shall beauteously unfold-
Severed shall be thy despot alien foes
From minds of loftier mould.
The seed of thought so nobly strown broadcast,
In fields of light shall upward sprout and grow,
And sweet the fruitage gathered in at last,
Shall be to all who sow!
Ye yet shall see your lov'd Italia freed;
O, brave Mazzini! Garibaldi bold!
Eternal justice hath the end decreed
Of cruelties untold
The tidal pulses of the mighty past
Mingle and throb in Freedom's burning veins! 
Ten thousand lips have vow'd to break at last
Vile Pio-Nono's chains!
When Might and Right in deadly conflict meet,
Justice shall win, and wave the victor's palm;
Heroic souls shall yield to no defeat,
But for the contest arm-
Till high on Victory's battlement they stand,
Unfurling wide the banner of the free,
Proclaiming Liberty throughout the land,
From bounding sea to sea!
Nantucket, July 16, 1859.

WOMAN'S PLEA FOR WOMAN'S RIGHTS.
It is not that we do not share
Enough of love and loving care;
We do not ask a lot in life
Exempt from all earth's toilsome strife;
We count our lot as more than blest,
So long as on Love's faithful breast
We rest secure; but others' grief
Is calling loudly for relief.
And shall we calmly sit and see
Another's wrongs and misery?
Forbid it, Heaven!-we hear the wail
That floats upon the Southern gale;
Four million human voices blend
In one wild crythe skies they rend;
They ask the God-given right to be
Blest with the boon of liberty.
And, in our midst, our homes, whose light
Long since went out in darkest night,
Where love and hope were doomed to fade,
And children worse than orphans made,
And pinching want, and cruel woe,
And fond wives hearts such anguish know
As words of ours are vain to speak-
And shall we live from week to week
Amid such woe, and calmly rest
Content because our lot is blest?
Nay, we must speak-we will be heard-
By faithful act, and faithful word,
We'll do our part, though small it be,
To cheer and bless humanity.
Forbid us not; our hearts are strong;
Forbid us not; to us belongs
This right. While woman's heart is crushed,
Oh! say, shall woman's voice be hushed?

LOST TREASURES.
Let us be patient! God has taken from us
The earthly treasures upon which we leaned;
That from the fleeting things which lie about us,
Our clinging hearts should be forever weaned.
They have passed from us, all our broad possessions,
Ships whose white sails flung wide past distant shores,
Lands whose rich harvest smiled in the glad sunshine,
Silver and gold, and all our hoarded stores.
And, dearer far, the pleasant home where gathered
Our loved and loving round the blazing hearth,
Where honored age, on the soft cushion seated,
And childhood played about in frolic mirth;-
Where, underneath the softened light, bent kindly
The mother's tender glance on daughters fair;
And he, on whom all leant with fond confiding, 
Rested contented from his daily care
All shipwrecked in one common desolation!
The garden walks by other feet are trod,
The clinging vines by other fingers tutored
To fling their shadows o'er the grassy sod.
While darkling care and deep humiliation
In tears are mingled with our daily bread,
And the rude blasts we never thought could reach us,
Have spent their wrath on each defenceless head.
Let us be cheerful! the same sky o'erarches,
Soft rains fall on the evil and the good;
On narrow walls and through our humble dwelling 
God's glorious sunshine pours as rich a flood.
Faith, hope and love still in our hearts abiding,
May bear their precious fruits in us the same;
And to the couch of suff'ring we may carry
If but a cup of water in His name.
Let us be thankful if, in this affliction,
No grave is opened for the loving heart;
And while we bend beneath our Father's chiding,
We yet can mourn each family apart.
Shoulder to shoulder let us breast the torrent,
With not one cold reproach or angry look;
There are such seasons when the heart is smitten,
It can no whisper of unkindness brook.
Our life is not in all these brief possessions,
Our home is not in any pleasant spot;
Pilgrims and strangers we must journey onward,
Contented with the portion of our lot.
These earthly walls must shortly be dismantled,
These earthly tents be struck by angel hands;
But to be built up on a sure foundation,
There! where our Father's mansion ever stands.
There shall we meet! father and child, and dearer, 
That earthly love which made half heaven of home:
There shall we find our treasures all awaiting
Where change and death and parting never come.

A. WISH.
God grant thy path be strown with flowers,
And all thy days be like the light
Thy presence lands my soul to-night,
And peace be shine through life's sad hours.

SPEECH OF C. C. BURLEIGH
At the Florence Celebration of W. I. Emancipation.
REPORTED BY DANIEL W. BOND.
Four weeks ago to-day, we were assembled in this place, to celebrate the anniversary of our nation's birth; an event interesting to us all as inhabitants of this country. Now we come together to commemorate an event no less important than that, and in which we have an interest no less vital, if not as Americans, yet as men. Though some may regard it as not an appropriate one for us to celebrate, for it belongs, they may say, to the history of another country; yet it seems to me that it is no less, for that reason, an event to call forth our joy and gratitude. True, this is a proud day for the British people; one which they have reason to welcome with songs and the voice of oratory, with peal of bells and blast of the jubilant trumpet, and every token of national rejoicing; for never yet, in all the brightest scenes of her heroic achievements, from the earliest days of her old renown even until now, has Britain wrought a deed more glorious than that which, twenty-five years ago, gave liberty to eight hundred thousand chattel bondmen. Never has she won a nobler victory than when she struck the blow which gave her poet of humanity a right to sing-
'Thy chains are broken, Africa, be free!
Thus saith the Island-Empress of the sea;
Thus saith Britannia, O, ye winds and waves,
Waft the glad tidings to the land of slaves;
Proclaim on Guinea's coast, by Gambia's side,
And far as Niger rolls his eastern tide,
Thy chains are broken, Africa, be free! 
Thus saith Britannia, Empress of the sea.' 
A lofty title that, to claim, the Empress of the sea'! but never looked she worthier to bear it than when, using her imperial power to carry freedom across the ocean to those myriads of captives, to raise that mighty mass of chattelism beyond the seas to recognized manhood. A proud day was that for Britain; but it was not her day alone, it was our day, it was humanity's day. The victory which it witnessed was not achieved for the British Empire only, but for all the human race. The deed which then was done, was done for no nation; it was done for man; and it claims the joyous and grateful recognition of all, in every land, who know the meaning and the worth of manhood. It asserted, on behalf of a degraded and despised caste, the inherent, essential dignity of our human nature, made in the image of God, and drawing its life from a Divine inspiration. This it is which distinguishes man from the brute. There it is a spirit in man, and, say your wise philosophers of materialism what they may, the inbreathing of the Almighty,' not the delicate texture of brain, or fine and curious network of nerves, giveth him understanding. The charge we bring against the slave system is, that it disregards this broad distinction; confounds the likeness of the Creator, the embodiment of the Divine inbreathing, with cattle, merchandize, and tools of labor; turns the being so nobly endowed into a mere instrument for another's use. God did not make man that he might till the soil of which the produce should be another's. Not for this was he created in his Maker's likeness; and so said England in the act we now commemorate. She spoke for humanity, and republished the sublime old truth which is attested by every record of Divine revelation, whether written by the hand of man, on ancient parchments and papyrus rolls, or by the finger of God himself on the inmost consciousness of the human soul. Man, the child and the image of God, the incarnation of a spiritual essence, was not created to be a chattel slave. Every where, around us, within us, the voice of God asserts this truth; and England echoed that voice when she struck off the chains from her West Indian slaves, and said, Henceforth, be free!
Nor only for this reason is the triumph of freedom in the West Indies worthy to be celebrated; but also for the earnestness, the fidelity, the heroism in moral warfare, displayed in achieving it. It was no easy task which British philanthropists attempted, when they essayed to break those chains in the colonies. The West India Interest, as it was called, was strong in England when the battle with it was first joined; not so strong, doubtless, as the Slave Power is in this country, but strong enough to test severely the moral strength, the courage, faith and perseverance of the men who led the onset upon it; the little band-as at first it was-who gathered to redress the wrongs and repair the injuries of ages, in those tropic isles. It had its able and influential representatives in Parliament, its powerful allies in the great commercial and manufacturing towns, and even its champions in the church, its partisans on the Bishops' bench in the House of Lords. It was entrenched in long-standing and deeply-fixed prejudices, and in the real or fancied pecuniary interests of multitudes. Against this power, so fortified, the handful of fearless philanthropists had to contend. Few, and for the most part of little personal influence, they were deemed fit objects rather of derision than of dread. Who cares for these broad-brimmed Quakers, with their impracticable notions? Who cares for these fanatical disciples of Granville Sharpe and Thomas Clarkson? What are their wild vagaries against the wisdom of England's legislators, the ripe experience of England's statesmen, the practical common sense of England's merchants and manufacturers, the enlightened piety and conservative sobriety of judgment of England's venerable mitred heads?' The contest seemed a most unequal one; the advantage, to the eye of worldly policy, all on the side of the oppressor. The relative strength of the contending parties was, apparently, almost as when, of old, the prophet's servant, looking with terror on the Syrian host arrayed against his master, uttered his despairing cry, Alas! how shall we do? But, as the prophet's answer was, they that be with us are more than they that be with them, so might those few but firm defenders of the bondman's rights assure each other, They who are with us are more than they that be with our adversaries They may have their parliamentary partisans; they may have the merchants of Liverpool and Bristol, and the manufacturers of Manchester; they may have all the aid which they can get from the false teachings of professed Christian ministers, who belie the principles of Christ, and pervert the word of God to uphold iniquity; but still we are on the stronger side.' For so they were. Upon their side were the truth and the right. On their side was God; and, as one of our own countrymen, and of the proscribed race, too, has said, One with God is a majority.' In such a faith they entered on their work, expecting to succeed at last, though not without energetic and protracted labor. The triumph came more speedily than they expected. I remember to have seen a letter written by one of the British abolitionists to a kindred spirit in this country, saying, in substance, we have done our utmost to move Parliament to action, but have failed, and from present indications, we see no prospect of success at an early day. Yet this was just before the passage of the Act of Emancipation. Almost the next arrival, so to speak, brought tidings that the deed was done. But long had they toiled, and laboriously, before this and was reached. They had roused the nation by reiterated and persistent appeals from platform, pulpit and press; they had enlightened the public mind by abundant exhibitions of the true features and actual working of the slave system; they had met in public debate <illegible> hired champions of slavery-able, adroit and unscrupulous-and had vanquished them, and driven them completely from the field, by resistless eloquence and the overwhelming weight of facts and arguments; they had rallied a host of new <illegible> to the standard of freedom, or-
<c03>
ganized them for effective action, and, by constant agitation, kept alive their interest and zeal; they had besieged Parliament with petitions bearing hundreds of thousands of names from every quarter of the kingdom, till at length the swell of rising public sentiment which they had created could be withstood no longer, as it bore on their cause to victory.
It was another demonstration added to the many which the world's experience has already given, that, in the long run, nothing can stand against justice. One great reason of this is obvious. When we are at work for justice, we are co-working with constant force; the unvarying law which God has established in his universe is ever steadily cooperating with us, sure and unceasing as the power of gravitation; while that which works against us is spasmodic, intermittent Evil is often in conflict with itself, in one form counteracting its own force in another; but right is always self-harmonious. Sometimes, the wrong may seem to be the stronger, and the right be overborne; but it is only a transient victory, for the continually acting force must prevail at last, although the intermittent power has periods of the greater energy. So Etna, or Vesuvius, when its slumbering strength awakes, seems, in defiance of the law of gravitation, to be pouring itself from its inmost depths upon the sky; huge masses of the riven rock shoot upward farther than the eye can follow, as if they would ascend for ever; while through black smoke and cinders which fill the air and hide the heavens, the red fires of the abyss leap out and climb, till the affrighted fancy almost sees the spirits of the pit, at Moloch's fierce suggestion, storming the celestial battlements, armed with hell-flames and fury,' mixing Tartarian sulphur and strange fire' with the soft sunshine of the upper world, and threatening to hurl earth, in fragments, beyond the restraint of preserving law. But wait a little while, and the infernal force is spent; it slackens, yields to the unrelaxing pressure of gravitation; and the victor whelms the retreating demons with their own rock-missiles, cast back into their den. The mountain sleeps once more, and, subdued to silence, its rebellious forces own that there is a power stronger than the spirits of the dark abyss. Thus it is in the contest between temporarily triumphant iniquity and the right of the helpless. Helpless? No! there are no helpless in God's universe, save those who set themselves against God. There are no helpless among the most down-trodden poor of God's people. For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.'
The victory was sure, then, to the enemies of colonial slavery. Faithful and persevering, at last this little band of wild enthusiasts' who stood up for those eight hundred thousand chattels, became the controlling power of the realm. Once sneered at by grave legislators, they now gave law to the Legislature; once derided by proud statesmen, they now dictated the policy of the State. The very man who, on the floor of Parliament, had called Wilberforce a fanatic, was at length constrained to consummate a triumph of the fanatical' cause, more ample and complete than Wilberforce had dared at first ask or hope for. As Duke of Clarence, he could sneer at the assailant of the African slave trade; but as King William the Fourth, he had to bow to the fanatic,' and set his hand to the Act of Emancipation which abolished the slave system of the colonies; an act which the fanaticism' he before denounced, had not then ventured to demand. Thus it is:
Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again,
The eternal years of God are hers;
But, Error, wounded, writhes in pain,
And dies amid her worshippers'
But men said, this abolition of slavery is a mad scheme, any how, and if it does succeed, the most pernicious results will follow. You will plunge the colonies in ruin, if you do this rash work which you propose. But how has history answered these alarm cries of a false conservatism? They said we should have, in Jamaica and Barbadoes, all the horrors of St. Domingo re-enacted. They said, if this thing is done which you ask, the islands will blaze and smoke with conflagrations, and their rivers will run blood from the mountains to the sea. Well, the day came which was to witness the fulfilment of these dire predictions, and how was it welcomed? As the last day of slavery was drawing to its close, how were the bondmen preparing to receive the change in their condition? Were they whetting the knife of massacre and lighting the incendiary torch? With what emotions were they watching through the hours of that gladly-expected night for the coming of the moment which should set them free? Was it with the spirit of revenge glowing in their bosoms, kindled by the wrongs and insults and provocations of years, of ages, heaped upon them and upon their race? No; but with mingled joy and gratitude, they welcomed the precious boon of freedom. Gathered in their places of religious worship, watching with eager eyes the index of the clock as it moved slowly up to twelve, listening for the peal of its midnight stroke, their knees were bent in prayer, their voices were raised in songs of rejoicing and thanksgiving, their hearts were swelling with gratitude to God, and to those good people of England whom he had inspired to work out their deliverance. I have here a record of facts collected in those islands by two noble young men who went out from this country to investigate with care the workings of emancipation. I will read, in their own eloquent words, the description of the manner in which freedom was received in Antigua;- and, so far as the spirit manifested by the emancipated is concerned, it will apply to all the islands:-
The Wesleyans kept watch-night" in all their chapels on the night of the 31st of July. One of the Wesleyan missionaries gave us an account of the watch-meeting at the chapel in St. John's. The spacious house was filled with the candidates for liberty. All was animation and eagerness. A mighty chorus of voices swelled the song of expectation and joy, and, as they united in prayer, the voice of the leader was drowned in the universal acclamations of thanks-giving and praise and blessing and honor and glory to God, who had come down for their deliverance. In such exercises the evening was spent, until the hour of twelve approached. The missionary then proposed that when the clock on the cathedral should begin to strike, the whole congregation should fall upon their knees, and receive the boon of freedom in silence. Accordingly, as the loud bell tolled its first note, the immense assembly fell prostrate on their knees. All was silence, save the quivering, half stifled breath of the struggling spirit. The slow notes of the clock fell upon the multitude; peal on peal, peal on peal, rolled over the prostrate throng, in tones of angels' voices, thrilling among the desolate chords and weary heart-strings. Scarce had the clock sounded its last note, when the lightning flashed vividly around, and a loud peal of thunder roared along the sky-God's pillar of fire and trump of jubilee! A moment of profoundest silence passed-then came the burst. They broke forth in prayer; they shouted, they sung Glory, alleluia; they clapped their hands, leaped up, fell down, clasped each other in their free arms, cried, laughed, and went to and fro, tossing upward their unfettered hands; but high above the whole, there was a mighty sound which ever and anon swelled up; it was the utterance, in broken negro dialect, of gratitude to God.
This, then, is the answer which was given to those false alarms. And why should we not trust the forbearance, the absence of all vindictiveness in the freedman's heart, which accompanied this triumph? Why not trust the power which governed the feelings of that multitude in the moment of its highest excitement? If the black man manifested only such emotions as are here displayed, even in the state of wild excitement caused by his first consciousness of freedom, why should we doubt that liberty may be safely given him, wherever he is still enslaved? Nor. have subsequent events cast any doubt upon the safety of emancipation. Instead of an increase of danger, its diminution has been manifest and marked, marked, <illegible> much that the military protection once deemed necessary to the internal quiet of the colonies has been almost wholly withdrawn. Before emancipation,' say
<c04>
Thome and Kimball, speaking of Antigus-and the same, substantially, is true of all the islands-martial law invariably prevailed in the Christmas holidays, but the very first Christmas after emancipation, the Governor proclaimed that, in consequence of the abolition of slavery, such a precaution was no longer necessary' And it has never been needed since.
Another frequent objection to the Anti-Slavery cause was most effectually refuted by the result of the British Act. We are told that the black man does not wish for liberty, is contented and happy' as a slave, and delights in his present way of life. He has no care, his wants are all supplied, he is provided for in sickness and old age; and much more to the same purpose is said to delude us into the belief that the slave has no desire to be free. Here is the answer, in this enthusiasm of joy, this wild exultation of delight, with which the West Indian slaves received their freedom. Do you not believe that the feeling of African humanity is the same along the banks of the Potomac, the Santee and the Mississippi, as in the Antilles?   Nay, is not African humanity essentially the same as any other type of humanity? Look, then, within, for an answer to the question whether the slave likes his chains. It is nonsense to tell us that manhood loves enslavement, And is not manhood one? There is a genealogical record which some of us believe, which teaches us that he who was the first-born among many brethren,' was the son of Adam, who was the son of God.' For all his brethren, therefore, we claim that lofty lineage, and with it all those native instincts and noble aspirations-in their rudiments, at least- which belong to beings having such a lineage. That manhood which in ourselves we know is impatient of unjust constraint, and delights in the sense of freedom, we believe is the black man's manhood too But if any will not believe this, will insist on a distinction between Caucasian and African humanity, then to such we say, at all events, this African humanity is one in Jamaica and in Carolina; and the proof that it loves liberty and hates slavery in the isles, proves that it is not content with slavery on the mainland.
The event we celebrate has, then, important lessons for our own country. It is an example of justice to the wronged; of a practical recognition of human rights, well worthy to be imitated here; and, in the light of all our high pretensions as a freedom-loving people, it should shame us into the performance of our long-neglected duty. It proves the doing of that duty to be safe, and shows that the excuses for not doing it are utterly fallacious. It exhibits, too, such traits of character in the injured race as may well suggest the danger, ever-growing, of a refusal to perform that duty. If the slave loves freedom, and is impatient under the oppressor's yoke, can we be sure that he will always bow beneath it? If his wrongs are not redressed and his rights restored by the willing act of the repenting wrong-doer, then a time may come when, by terrible things in righteousness, God will vindicate his violated law; and that, too, not by miraculous interposition, by any raining of fire and hail from above, or any yawning of the earth beneath, but by the necessary working of those natural causes which are ever undermining the foundations of every system based on wrong, and built up with iniquity.
Much more I have to say, but the lapse of time reminds me that I must break off, even though it be abruptly, and give room to others who wish to instruct or interest you, or to give expression to their own feelings, in view of this great event.
SPEECH OF REV. J. BLANCHARD.
Having been introduced as wishing only to say Amen to the preceding speech, Rev. JONATHAN BLANCHARD, President of Knox College, at Galesburg, Illinois, said-
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:
As your President has told you, I appear here to say Amen to the sentiments of the speaker who has just addressed you. While listening to him, my thoughts have turned back to twenty-five years ago, when I used to hear him in behalf of this cause, and I find him to-day uttering the same sentiments which I listened to so long ago; and with no abatement of the old earnestness and power.
[After dwelling briefly upon the reminiscences of that period, he proceeded:]
I have nothing in the form of a speech to make to you; I will say, however, the question before you is plain. It is a question of simple right against simple wrong. There is no question of the wrongfulness of American slavery; it is simply whether the American people will do what is plainly right, or persist in what is plainly wrong. The occasion which you celebrate to-day is all which it has been represented to be. It is not second in importance to that you celebrate on the Fourth of July. It is true that the Declaration of Independence announces the principles which underlie every movement for freedom. It is true that the practical declaration of the British Parliament, that God did not make men for slaves, is a logical inference from those principles. But when this government was formed, there was a new note put in, to the text of the Declaration, and it was virtually made to read, that' all men are born free and equal, except Negroes and Indians.' When those slaves were set free in the British colonies, it was done by a carrying out, in practice, of the principles of our Declaration as it originally stood. It was done by the application of the doctrines of the New Testament; by the influence of the great truth there revealed, that man was born to the immortal life of the offspring of God and therefore cannot rightly be the property of man.
After some words which the reporter lost, the speaker went on to say, that the abolition of slavery in the colonies was due, in no small degree, to the self-sacrificing zeal and devotion of the missionaries who labored among the slaves, and who, having by their fidelity in the work of their sympathy with the oppressed become the victims of persecution by the slaveholders, and been driven from the islands, had gone back to England, and stirred up the people to demand the freedom of the slaves. I have met, he said, some of those men, and I know them to be true men.
But I did not mean to make long remarks, and will only add, that I pray to God Almighty to hasten the day when in this land, also, slavery shall be over-thrown, and when all men everywhere shall be free.

A PLEASANT REMINISCENCE.
THE LATE CHARLES F. HOVEY.
FRIEND GARRISON:
Now that our dear friend and faithful co-laborer rests from the toils of life, and from his struggle with spiritual wickedness in the high places' of this world, where he cannot be unpleasantly affected by a public reference to his acts of benevolence while living, please allow me a little of your valuable space in which to record one of his noble deeds,-of which the world is not cognizant,-evincing his deep interest in the welfare of young men, some of whom he did not even know, and his desire to give them a fair start in life.
I intended to give publicity to this generous act soon after its occurrence, but was prevented doing so by the suggestion of a personal friend of his, who assured me that its magnanimous author would prefer that it should not be heralded in the public journals.
I deem it too good to lie longer buried with the things, of the forgotten past, and, therefore, I send you an exact transcript of the following letter, (which will sufficiently explain itself,) which I have in my possession. It was written as its date indicates, from Paris, to one of his partners in Boston:-
<c05>
PARIS, March 8, 1854.
I wish you to get two thousand dollars from C. F. Hovey & Co., and charge the same to my account. This money I wish you to dispose of dispose of immediately, as follows:-divide it among those who have been with us since August 1, 1853, and whom you still continue in your employ. Let the dividend be in proportion to the salaries they received between August 1, 1853, and Feb'y 1, 1854. I send this money to these persons, because, if they have been faithful, I feel it is doing them no more than justice. If there are any among them who have not been faithful, so much the worse for them. If they will allow a person, so much older than themselves, and one who has probably had more experience, to give them a word of advice, the time may come when they will feel it was worth receiving, and paying attention to; but I must say, I have very little faith faith that they will follow my advise
In the first place, then, in the language of John Randolph, I would say to them-
"PAY AS YOU GO."
Then I would say to them-Do your own thinking on all subjects, and save the Priests, Doctors of Divinity, Generals, Judges, Lawyers, Doctors and Statesmen the trouble of thinking for you, which they are always ready to do.
I assure you these great people, whom I have named above, are only (as the Frenchman said) Grands parceque nous sommes a genou-which may be translated thus-The great only appear great to us, because we are on our knees. I should add, however, that grand," in French, means tall as well as great.
After thinking freely for yourself at all times, dare to say what you think, however unpopular your thoughts may be, and remember a dead fish can swim down stream, but that it takes it takes a live one to swim up.
I remain, yours truly,
C. F. HOVEY.'
How refreshing it is, in a time of such general selfishness, when men (professing godliness, even,) are lovers of their own selves,' and without natural affection,'-see 2d Tim., 3: 1 to 5-to meet with such an oasis in this world's great moral desert! We almost involuntarily exclaim, as we contemplate such a character-
As travellers in a desert land
Smile when they see a stream at hand,
So we rejoice whene'er we see
Such deeds of pure philanthropy.
When the sun (of righteousness) is every where being darkened by the false teachings of men, and the moon (the church) does not give her light, and the stars (her false teachers) are falling from (the moral) heaven, it is pleasant to see, occasionally, a comet shoot through the horizon, reminding us that though the great central sun of the universe is obscured to human vision, by the intervention of dark political and ecclesiastical bodies of men, it still lives,' and will-when these bodies have disappeared, as they certainly must-shine on the world with an effulgence which shall send these moral bats (their leaders) to their own place.'
Our dear friend, who, while living, would not let his left hand know what his right hand did,' died, and was buried as unostentatiously as he lived. No D. D. stood over him while dying to point him whither he himself was not going. None stood over his coffined corse to herald to a curious multitude his fictitious virtues, or to express hope of his safe arrival in heaven, and then, in doubt, leave him groping between that place and its antipodes. None did or could say of him, that the merchant princes' ever bought him to cover up their sins,' that he might thus aid them in their efforts to keep out of trouble, which they might anticipate as the natural result of injustice.
The world has seen but few men of such moral worth and sterling integrity as Charles F. Hovey. In the coming generations, may such men be multiplied a hundred fold. Such men'as Wendell Phillips once said of another-never die. In harmony with this sentiment, I will close this brief tribute with the following beautiful thoughts, by a beautiful poet:-
Nothing good shall ever perish,
Only the corrupt shall die;
Truth, which men and angels cherish,
Flourishes eternally.
None are wholly God-forsaken,
All his sacred image bear;
None so lost but should awaken
In our hearts a brother's care.
Words of kindness, words of warning,
Dream not thou may'st work in vain;
Even those thy counsel scorning,
Oft from sin may turn again.
Words of kindness we have spoken
May, when we have passed away,
Heal, perhaps, a spirit broken,
Guide a brother led astray.
Not one act but is recorded,
Not a word but has its weight;
Every virtue is rewarded-
Outrage punished soon or late.
Let no being, then, be rated
As a thing of little worth;
Every soul that is created
Has its part to play on earth.'
Boston, Aug. 21, 1859. JUSTITIA.
After this excellent letter had been submitted to the fine corps of young men for whom it was written, they immediately ordered it lithographed, and each one thus secured a copy. May its valuable sentiments be often the subject of their meditations, and do much to mould their actions in future life!
A MERITED REBUKE. In another column, the reader will find a capital letter from Wendell Phillips to the Chief Justice of Massachusetts and the President of Harvard University. This letter is doubtless simply intended to refresh  the recollection of two prominent citizens of Massachusetts, holding positions invested with no ordinary responsibility, that there is an influence connected with the places they occupy that should be guarded with the most scrupulous care. The ovation given to Paul Morphy, the renowned chess player, a few weeks since in Boston, will be recollected. It was a great occasion for a very small matter, and the press far and near was not sparing of its criticisms in relation to the great boo.' Mr. Phillips handles it about right, and we are glad to give his letter currency to the extent of our circulation.
The array of notables present on the occasion, and the gross violation of a very important statute of the State, to an extent even that might perhaps give the affair the character of a Bacchanalian Revel,' renders it worthy of a passing notice. The instructors of our youth, and the administrators of our laws, upon all questions involving the public morality, should present an untarnished record, and when they so far' step aside' as to merit a little gentle reproof, false delicacy should never step in to shield them. The principles embodied in the letter of Mr. Phillips are, or should be, universally applied, and we are glad to see such wholesome truths so fearlessly and independently uttered.-Northern Advocate.
WONDERFUL RECAPS FROM DROWNING. A letter from Norfolk, in the Richmond Dispatch, states that on Tuesday of last week, Capt. John Doughty was washed from the deck of his sloop, about 5 o'clock in the morning, when about five miles at sea, off Smith's Island. The sea was running very high at the time, and being unable to regain his vessel, he swam toward the shore, and attempted to land; the breakers, however, prevented his doing so, and he then swam around the southern end of the island, where he made a second attempt; this failed also, and after having passed four miles along the beach, he was taken by a current and washed inside of the capes. Here he was picked up by Captain Conkling, alter having been swimming eight hours, and carried into Alexandria, from which place he came to Norfolk,, and proceeded to his residence in Northampton County, where he will appear as one risen from the dead, since it was generally supposed he was drowned. He must have swam nearly fifteen miles, and that with his clothes on, except his boots, which he pulled off in the water. When rescued, he was nearly exhausted, and must have drowned in a few minutes.

Ayer's Sarsaparilla,
A Compound remedy, in which we have labored to produce the most effectual alterative that can be made. It is a concentrated extract of Paris sarsaparilla, so combined with other substances of still greater alterative power as to afford an effective antidote for the diseases Sarsaparilla is reputed to cure. It is believed that such a remedy is wanted by those who suffer from Strumous complaints, and that one which will accomplish their cure must prove of immense service to this large class of our afflicted fellow-citizens. How completely this compound will do it has been proven by experiment on many of the worst cases to be found of the following complaints:-
SCROFULA AND SCROFULOUS COMPLAINTS, ERUPTIONS AND ERUPTIVE DISEASES, ULCERS, PIMPLES BLOTCHES, TUMORS, SALT RHEUM, SCALD HEAD, SYPHILIS AND SYPHILITIC AFFECTIONS, MERCURIAL DISEASE, DROPSY, NEURALGIA OR TIC DOULOURRUI, DEBILITY, DYSPEPSIA  AND INDIGESTION, ERYSIPELAS, ROSE OR ST. ANTHONY'S FIRE, and indeed the whole class of complaints arising from IMPURITY OF THE BLOOD.
This compound will be found a great promoter of health, when taken in the spring, to expel the foul humors which fester in the blood at that season of the year. By the timely expulsion of them many rankling disorders are nipped in the bud. Multitudes can, by the aid of this remedy, spare themselves from the endurance of foul eruptions and ulcerous sores, through which the system will strive to rid itself of corruptions, if not assisted to do this through the natural channels of the body by an alternative medicine. Cleanse out the vitiated blood whenever you find its impurities bursting through the skin in pimples, eruptions, or sores; cleanse it when you find it is obstructed and sluggish in the veins; cleanse it whenever it is foul, and your feelings will tell you when. Even where no particular disorder is felt, people enjoy better health, and live longer, for cleansing the blood. Keep the blood healthy, and all is well; but with this pabulum of life disordered, there can be no lasting health. Sooner or later something must go wrong, and the great machinery of life is disordered or overthrown.
Sarsaparilla has, and deserves much, the reputation of accomplishing these ends. But the world has been egregiously deceived by preparations of it, partly because the drug alone has not all the virtue that is claimed for it, but more because many preparations, pretending to be concentrated extracts of it, contain but little of the virtue of Sarsaparilla, or any thing else.
During late years the public have been misled by large bottles, pretending to give a quart of Extract of Sarsaparilla for one dollar. Most of these have been frauds upon the sick, for they not only contain little, if any, Sarsaparilla, but often no curative properties whatever. Hence, bitter and painful disappointment has followed the use of the various extracts of Sarsaparilla which flood the market, until the name itself is justly despised, and has become synonymous with imposition and cheat. Still we call this compound Sarsaparilla, and intend to supply such a remedy as shall rescue the name from the load of obloquy which rests upon it. And we think we have ground for believing it has virtues which are irresistible by the ordinary run of the diseases it is intended to cure. In order to secure their complete eradication from the system, the remedy should be judiciously taken according to directions on the bottle.

HOPEDALE LANDS OPENED FOR SETTLEMENT.
We bespeak attention to Br. E. D. Draper's advertisement as above, offering for sale sundry parcels of Hopedale land. Some two years since, when most of the Joint Stock Property of the Hopedale Community was individualized and divided among the stock-holders, a large portion of the Community Domain went legitimately into the private possession of Br. Draper. He has recently caused his lands to be surveyed into homesteads of from two to twenty acres each, with a view to offer them for sale to persons friendly to our distinguishing principles, who may choose to settle in our midst. We hope that a goodly number of friends, cherishing a general sympathy with our people, and desiring to give their children the advantages of our excellent select and common schools, will avail themselves of the new opening. Seeing that we must be selves of the new opening. Seeing that we must be disappointed in not realizing the Unitary social arrangements, the anticipation of which originally attracted us hither, the next best thing is, to see as good a Neighborhood built up as circumstances will allow. We are therefore pleased with Br. Draper's new plan of offering small homesteads for sale to our friends scattered abroad. May the movement be crowned with success.-Pactionl Christian.

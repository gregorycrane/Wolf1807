REFUGE OF OPPRESSION.
<c01>
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?
No wonder that some of the leading organs of Republicanism writhe under the disclosures at Harper's Ferry. The first accounts received were <illegible>. They were not such as too connect the outrages of Ossawotamie Brown and his associates with their former well-known confederates in the North. But the evidence deepens, and each hour adds new testimony. Letters and remittances have been found among the effects of the insurgents from Gerrit Smith and Frederick Douglass. Other documents are in possession of Gov. Wise, of Virginia, the purport of which is not yet known to us. No wonder that the Evening Post, Tribune, and other journals of the same class, would fain palliate the enormities which have sent such a thrill of horror through the land. Well do they know that the sanguinary scenes of Harper's Ferry were but the carrying out of the principles inculcated by such journals. Well do they remember the proceedings at the North Church, New Haven, on the 21st of March, 1856, when Silliman, Kill'em & Co., subscribed rifles wherewith to arm their fellow-citizens who were about proceeding to Kansas; and when Rev. Mr. Beecher shouted,-'If twenty-five rifles can be subscribed on the spot, I will pledge twenty-five more for Plymouth Church'! Twenty-seven were procured, and the pledge, thus publicly given, we may presume was fulfilled. At any rate, the scent of blood-the blood of slaveholders-has been snuffed by not a few men at the North and East, including (shame on them!) many professed disciples, and even ministers of the Princes of Peace; and we may safely say, that the large stores of arms, ammunition, &c., found among the effects of the insurgents, besides what they stole from the Armory, were not purchased with their own money. Many others must have been concerned with them, to supply such an amount of the sinews of war. Brown says he brought all the arms from Connecticut and other Eastern points; and that among them were
200 revolvers,
200 Sharp's rifles, and
1000 spears,
together with an abundance of powder and other ammunition. The cost of these articles could not be less than $10,000 or $12,000.
Again it is stated that 'bushels of letters have been discovered among the effects of the insurgents, from all parts of the country'.
Brown further states that he was expecting reinforcements from Maryland, Kentucky, North and South Carolina, and from Canada.
A Republican paper, which is supposed to be well posted in all matters relating to the 'irrepressible conflict', acknowledges that the colored population of this city were secretly advised of the plot prior to its outbreak. Were not others besides colored people aware of it?
From all these facts, it is evident that the ramifications of the conspiracy were extensive, and that very many persons must have been privy to it, North and South, white and black; most of the white men immediately concerned in the outbreak were from New England; though several of them have resided a short time in Kansas. The three Browns were originally from Springfield, Mass.
Where, then, rests the responsibility of this insurrection? Who is responsible for the many lives lost, and for the hangings and imprisonments which are yet to follow? Do not the words, THOU ART THE MAN, frown down upon every one of those persons, whether editors, clergymen, or other citizens, who have aided, directly or indirectly, in exciting or promoting the fatal attempt? It matters not that they thought they were doing God service. It is in vain that they assevorate, in the distressed language of one of our contemporaries, that, 'No political party is responsible,' and plead in extenuation of the atrocities of Brown, that he was 'crazy.' To be sure he was crazy, and has long been so; but he is no more crazy than those by whom he has so long been encouraged in his bloody career.
It is not our intention to say that all, or even a large part, of those who abetted Brown in his course in Kansas, would distinctly approve of his conduct at Harper's Ferry. They would at least say that he should have managed the matter better. Many of them, we trust, would denounce the whole movement, from beginning to end. And yet they may be in a measure responsible for it. For while teaching the doctrine of 'irrepressible conflict' between the slave and free states, and furnishing material aid for operations in one quarter, their disciples, less discreet, have made it available for service in what they deemed the same cause in another locality. It is easy to trace the connection between cause and effect,-between the teachings of the leading spirits of Republicanism, and the practice of their willing instruments, in carrying out the spirit of the doctrines thus inculcated. If the latter are less prudent than their leaders, it is by no means certain that they are less responsible before the bar of public opinion.-N. Y. Journal of Commerce.
A little vigor is wanted in such an emergency, and we regret that it has not fallen to the lot of a man like the Superintendent at Springfield, Gen. Whitney, to take in hand the band of desperadoes who have been guilty of this enormous outrage in Virginia.
The proceeding at best is a fool-hardy and desperate one, and could not have had the approval of cool heads or discreet judgments, even if the chances of success were the only question at issue. A man of good sense must have known that the insurrection, even if temporarily successful, would, in a few days at the most, be crushed out. Such we do not doubt was the expectation of the leaders; but having for years past been the instruments of the 'irrepressible-conflict' party at the North, and partially successful in keeping open the warfare between the Slave and the Free States, they have become monomaniacs on that subject, and, in their fanatical desire, for notoriety as martyrs, were willing to take the chances of personal danger, if thus they might promote further conflict between freedom and slavery.
The chosen leader of the Virginia insurrection is the notorious Brown, of Kansas celebrity, a man of great personal courage and energy, once deemed a respectable man in Massachusetts, but so infuriated by his operations as agent and paid hireling of the New England Republicans in the Kansas strifes as to be capable of any measure, however desperate, which promised to increase the hatred between the North and the South. It his boast, and that of his friends, that he had slain numbers of pro-slavery men in Kansas; and now that his occupation was gone in that locality, he appears to have been looking about for another field of labor. Accordingly, if the reports which have reached us are correct, he hired a farm, and has been prowling about in the vicinity of the scene of the late conflict, evidently laying his plans for the movement which we are now compelled to chronicle.
We do not desire to charge prominent men in the Republican party with any immediate connection with this insurrection, and await the investigation
<c02>
which must follow, before attempting to fasten the legal responsibility where it belongs. But morally there can be no question that the movement has been hastened, if it was not primarily caused, by the alarming doctrines preached by politicians of the Seward, Giddings, and Sumner and Burlingame school. They have not only declared that there must be an irrepressible conflict between freedom and slavery, until the country is all free or all slave, but some of them have predicted the very movement which has now been initiated, and which has only failed to accomplish its purpose, by the imperfect plot and the want of sense brought into requisition by its leaders.
The leader of this diabolical attempt to array the slaves against their masters, and to cause them to imbrue their hands in the blood of the whole white population, is the pet and paid employe of the Republicans of Massachusetts; if not now actually supported by them, at least a former recipient of their pecuniary aid. After his boasts that pro-slavery men had met with their death at his own hands, he visited New England, was received with open arms by leading Republican politicians, donations were collected for his support and future operations, and his action, brutal and murderous as it confessedly was, generally approved by the leaders in the Republican party. How well he has improved upon his teachings, and how he has turned the sympathy of that class of men to account, may be gathered from this last and basest of all his acts.-Ibid 

A. LESSON FOR THE PEOPLE. 
The 'irrepressible conflict' seems to have begun, and been as quickly repressed. The spirit and energy of the officers and troops at Harper's Ferry cannot be too much commended. As for the leading spirits in this absurd yet traitorous insurrection, the general execration of the people will pursue them to deserved doom. The nearest tree would be their fitting mode of exit from their scene of mischief; but we presume the forms of law will be gone through with against these ruffians, shooting down peaceful citizens, and in open revolt against the laws.
The originator of the revolt, according to his own confession, was the outlaw 'Old Brown,' one of the Kansas free soil ruffians, whose former exploits in that distracted territory were widely extolled, and became incorporated among the achievements and victories of the Republican party. We have no disposition to hold that party responsible for outrages like this, or to identify it with the murderous acts of this man and other associated with him. The respectable portion of that party could have known nothing of their true character. But the time has come when the evil fruit of the evil tree is beginning to be gathered. And we appeal to-day-as the occasion arises to justify and call for such an appeal-'here and now'-to the citizens of all parties, especially to conservative men who have become improvidently and unconsciously connected with an organization tending to such outrages, to turn aside at once from leaders, whose political doctrines conduct to disorder, plunder and murder. Disown 'Old Ossawatomie Brown' and the whole set of marauders, mischief-makers, public plunderers, and bad men in the front rank of whatever party or organization. Especially, turn from those hypocritical philanthropists who do no murder, only point the way-who would shield crime of every description, if only committed by one of their own party association.
We confidently appeal to the sober sentiment of the country, to discourage these excesses, and whatever may have a tendency to bring them about. We warn them, again and again, as we have often done, against the atrocious doctrines of the New York Senator, of the New York Tribune, the Albany Journal, and of the same tenor, if not in like degree, of journals nearer home. This is the time for reflection on this point. The 'Browns' of the day have received much encouragement from these presses. The civil conflict, which they and Mr. Seward would precipitate as an abstraction to be settled by the ballot box, violent and ignorant men reduce to a bloody practice. The contest has been, brief indeed at Harper's Ferry; nor do we dread any prolonged scene of disorder at home. But we must not forget that we have had tumults here very recently, originating in the same cause, and ending in yet unpunished murder. We are comparatively safe from any continuance of a strife like that in Virginia, for we have an organized force, efficient and disposed to maintain the public peace. 
We invoke the serious, earnest attention of the American people to those things. We ask their reflection upon them, not in any partizan spirit-not even as claiming fulfillment of any prophecy of our own-but as sincere and devoted lovers of a country grown great under the silent administration of law; and freer than any people on which the sun ever shone-except for this tyranny of combined fanaticism, fostered by false men who do not believe in it, yet use its victims for their own advancement and the common ruin. The revolt at Harper's Ferry brings the question directly home to every considerate mind,-Will you sacrifice the inestimable blessings of this Union for party ends? Will you listen to the counsels of Greeley and Giddings, and of Banks, who is willing, under certain circumstances-that is, when he thinks he can administer a Northern confederacy-to let this great sovereign Union of popular nationality 'slide'? Or, will you recur to the advice of the noble fathers of the Republic, and of their truly patriotic sons? We trust that every city and town in the nation will seize upon the occasion, and speak out upon this deplorable theme. Let the people, who are the source and strength of the government, give utterance to a common expression of true national sentiment. It is fitting that men should pause from their ordinary occupations to unite in thankfulness for this prompt deliverance from such a threatened calamity. For although the fire-brand may seem comparatively small, the design of the conspirators at the 'Ohio Fair' was sufficiently comprehensive in its wicked objects; and, but for the active and ready intervention of the national officers and faithful volunteer troops, who can tell what wide-spread and disastrous consequences might have ensued?
The latest accounts from the fatal scene inform us that one of the leaders has escaped the gallows, by the bullet, and that the chief of all is likely to do so, by the same means; but the spirit which impelled them to their traitorous deeds is still alive.

THE PLEA, OF INSANITY EXAMINED. 
The theory started about the Harper's Ferry business, by some of the Republican journals, in order to get rid, if possible, of the damning consequences of the doctrines they have advocated, is, that Brown, the leader, was insane. This is a convenient way of palliating treason-the highest crime which can be committed under the laws of all civilized nations, which leads to murder, as in the present case, and generally to all other abuses and offences. We think the plea can be admitted only as it applies to all criminals whatever. <illegible> omnes, 
<c03>
declared the Roman poet; and Bishop Butler once suggested the theory, that possibly all men were absolutely insane. In some sense it is true; at least of every criminal. Good conduct is so clearly the dictate of reason, that deviation from it may be justly taken as an indication of unsound mind. In general, however, this unsoundness comes from passions and propensities which we have fostered; it leaves us still the power of judgment and choice; and the laws of God and man justly hold us responsible for our evil doings.
In the case of 'the gallant Brown,' as the Advertiser styles him, he is held by some insane, because the expedition was hair-brained, and without any of the elements of probable success. It is not to be forgotten, that this theory equally involves the insanity of all those associated with him. It appears from the narration that Brown, no doubt an ignorant man, and incapable of seeing the end from the beginning, had become infuriated against the institution of slavery. His insanity was passion; and of he same quality as that which inspires the foul-mouthed vituperators here-Phillips, Parker, Garrison and the rest-and in New York and elsewhere, Cheever, Beecher, Gerrit Smith, Giddings, and others of that stamp. These let off their pent-up fury in popular harangues; but Brown having no such forum for which he is fit, takes to the Sharpe's rifles, recommended by some of the orators and reverend preachers before-mentioned; and which they took up contributions for in the churches, two years ago, to supply them to Brown and his associates in Kansas. If he is insane, therefore, they are all insane alike; if he is guilty, they are no less so, though not to be compared with him in courage, for they keep safely enough out of the danger of overt acts.
Taking all the circumstances into consideration-the constant misrepresentations of the condition and disposition of the slaves, by Northern presses and orators, the kind of sympathy which a man like Brown would be likely to meet with at the 'Ohio Fair,' and many similar places of congregation for fanatics-and his own recent life in Kanas, and the ill-blood stirred up for its cause not long ago, by the 'shriekers'-we cannot but think such a person very likely to believe in the success of his project, and quite likely to issue commissions to his deluded followers, as 'Provisional Commander-in-Chief of the United States.' This expedition was no more an evidence of insanity, than that of Charles Edward, so finely developed in 'Redgauntlet'; than Louis Napoleon's, when he escaped from Ham; than those repeated by Walker for the conquest of Nicaragua, or than hundreds of others which ended in utter ignominy and ruin. Our Republican contemporaries will scarcely maintain the ground thus assumed by them.-Boston Courier.

THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
The Republican party can beheld responsible only for the tendency of its principles and doctrines as avowed in its party platform. There is not the slightest connection between the principles or the acts of the party, and the mad inroad of Brown into Virginia. If Brown had any aiders and abettors or sympathizers at the North, it was among those who, like Garrison and Phillips, refuse to act with the Republican party because, as they allege, it is more conservative of Southern institutions in the Southern States even than the Democracy. Old Brown himself was repudiated by the free State party in Kansas, and denounced and repudiated that party in turn. The attempt to connect him or his insurrectionary movement with the Republican party is, therefore, as dishonest as it is senseless, and as it will be futile. The ignorant rabble who are addressed by the Democratic press and the narrow-minded conservatives, whose reading is confined to the Courier, may get such an idea into their brains by the natural process of absorption, but the public are intelligent as well as fair-minded. They are capable of tracing effects from causes, and of reasoning logically and consistently. They will see in the Harper's Ferry affair only the outbreak of a few insane fanatics, belonging to no political party, who have spread terror through a community, which, from its social organization, is peculiarly sensitive to any disturbing element.
In the name of truth and reason, is hatred of slavery a consequence of the existence and teachings of the Republican party? or does it afford any sanction to such criminal weakness as the scene at Harper's Ferry, which we so much lament? The blind fanaticism and unlawful conspiracies of Parker, Phillips, Garrison, Gerrit Smith and others, are no more a consequence of the existence of the Republican party, than the Courier's politics are a deduction from any established principle of right.
Let that cold blooded, heartless journalism, whose logic is as bad as its want of guiding principle is apparent, look to itself that its cheerless apathy be not the cause of the fanatical ravings of Northern abolitionists as well as of the wicked folly of such men as Brown.
There are thousands and tens of thousands who have placed themselves in opposition to the further extension of slavery, but will act as conservatives of law and order, and hold themselves ready to march anywhere to support the Constitution and the laws of the land. But they act from principle, and will choose still to believe slavery an evil, notwithstanding the moralizing of presees whose party folly has encouraged its aggressions. If any political party can be held responsible for the Harper's Ferry insurrection, it is the Democracy, which, by its Kansas policy has sown the wind, and reaped the whirlwind.-Boston Journal.

PARTISAN MEANNESS.
It must be expected that the organ of the pro-slavery interest would attempt to fix a portion of the responsibility for the lamentable outbreak at Harper's Ferry upon the Republican press of the country. Such an opportunity is altogether too tempting to uncandid and reckless partisans; and they will, of course, undertake to improve it to their own advantage; yet the simple truth is, that neither the Republican press nor any member of it is in any degree responsible for this insurrection. John Brown was never a Republican, never sympathized with its policy, endorsed its creed, nor voted for its candidates. The same is true of his associates in this insane attempt to incite rebellion and insurrection. These men were, if any thing politically, believers in the extreme views of such men as Mr. Garrison, Gerrit Smith, and Fred. Douglass, and in the habit of denouncing the Republican as well as the Democratic party. This fact is, of itself, a sufficient reason to all that may be alleged by pro-slavery organs and speakers against the Republican party as responsible for this brief but gloomy episode in our history. When a newspaper states that the insurrection at Harper's Ferry is a result of Republican teachings, or has any dependence whatever upon the principles and policy of that party, it states what is grossly, and under the circumstances, meanly false.

This clamor which has been raised over this affair, in itself insignificant, is idiotic. The man who will stand up and assert that the affair is a practical re-
 <co4>
sult of Republican principles, or a deduction from them, or in any way connected with them, ought to be ashamed to look a sensible man in the face for a week. Brown is a fanatic, whoso misguided rashness has led to this wild scheme, fruitless of any conceivable purpose, but to him and his followers tragic in termination. He is a denouncer and bitter hater of the professed objects of Republicans. And it may, with much more truth, be said that this mad scheme was the result of Democratic barbarity in Kansas, where Brown's son was brutally murdered, than of Republicanism.
It is not our purpose to waste ink in asserting and re-asserting that this is a matter which does not in any way connect itself with Republicans. Neither is it our design to spend three weeks thrown into attitude declaiming against what was at most but a magnified street row. We deeply regret the occurrence, as we do any act which shall tend to disturb and weaken the public security. Such an event we regard as in its measure as injurious to the cause of the slave and civilization, as it is fatal to the fanatical conspirators.-Boston Atlas and Bee.

BACKING OUT.
Already, the rats are leaving the sinking ship. Every where, those who have heretofore pleasantly fraternized: whose instincts and principles have found in the marauders of Kansas a fitting exponent; who have contributed liberally for their support, in concert with Emigrant Aid Societies, &c,, all these cry out lustily that they have no knowledge of this 'insane' fanatic Brown, and cannot with the least propriety be held responsible for his deeds. They wash their hands of his villany, and promise no more to be found in such bad company. This is encouraging. Had Brown succeeded, were he now marching through the Southern States at the head of infuriated hordes of armed negroes, every where victorious, slaughtering the white population, and proclaiming liberty to the captive,' the subject would be differently treated. The unfortunate seldom have many friends.
Although a very decided reaction in public sentiment has been observable throughout the country respecting the vexed question, we cannot but hope that wise counsels will soon every where prevail. When the fruits of abolition orators are seen in their true colors-in characters of blood; when precept is reduced to practice; when the horrors of a slave-insurrection begin to be appreciated, and the utter folly of attempting the abolition of slavery by any other than peaceable means is fully understood, then we may regard the 'Impending Crisis' as past beyond the power of resuscitation, even by the expert conjurors. Garrison, Phillips, Smith, Brown, &c.-N. Y. Journal of Commerce.

SELECTIONS.
From the Atlas and Bee.
REMINISCENCES OF THE INSURRECTIONISTS.
I desire to write a few hurried reminiscences of the recent insurrectionists at Harper's Ferry. Five of them, at least, were my intimate acquaintances-the Browns, Mr. Kagi, and John E. Cook. I met them frequently in Kansas, where they were repeatedly distinguished by their daring and brilliant exploits.
It is premature to write justly of their recent failure. It is easy enough to call it the insane attempt of a madman; to argue that old Brown was solely influenced by revenge; to invent ingenious theories of the limited extent of the rebellion-easy enough, in other words, to utter falsehood. The truth of the recent outbreak has not been found out yet, and it would not be expedient to state it here. The prisoners are not yet tried. Let it pass, therefore-for the present; let curses increase-for they will pass too, and old Brown and his memory be duly vindicated when the right time comes.

OLD BROWN.
Old Brown-John Brown-the chief and originator of the Insurrection, is a man of sixty-five years of age. He was born, I believe, in Connecticut; resided, for a considerable period of his life, in Springfield, Massachusetts; but for some time-perhaps for several years-had lived in the State of New York, somewhere in the vicinity of Utica. When the Kansas troubles broke out, he had a wife, seven sons and a daughter living. What are left of his family still live on his farm near Utica. At Springfield, I believe, he was engaged in the wool trade. Wherever he lived, he soon acquired the reputation of a man of the sternest integrity of character. In Kansas, he was the great living test of principle in our politicians. The more corrupt the man, the more he denounced old Brown. It was a true compliment to be praised or to be recognized by him as a friend: for, even in his social dealings, he would have no connection with any man of unprincipled or unworthy character. In his camp, he permitted no profanity; no man of loose morals was suffered to remain there-unless, indeed, as prisoners of war. 'I would rather have the small pox, yellow fever and cholera all together in my camp, than a man without principle.' This he said to the present writer, when speaking of some ruffianly recruits whom a well-known leader had recently introduced. 'It's a mistake, sir,' he continued, 'that our people make, when they think that bullies are the best fighters, or that they are the fit men to oppose these Southerners. Give me men of good principles-God-fearing men-men who respect themselves, and, with a dozen of them, I will oppose any hundred such men as these Buford ruffians.' His whole character is portrayed in these words. He was a Puritan in the Cromwellian sense of the word. He trusted in God, and kept his powder dry. Prayers were offered up in his camp every morning and evening; no food was eaten, unless grace was first asked on it.
For thirty years, he secretly cherished the idea of being the leader of a servile insurrection; the American Moses, predestined by Omnipotence to lead the servile nation in our Southern States to freedom: if necessary, through the Red Sea of a civil war, or a fiercer war of races. It was no 'mad idea,' 'concocted at a fair in Ohio,' but a mighty purpose, born of religious convictions, which he nourished in his heart for half a life time.
When the horizon of freedom looked gloomy in Kansas, he took leave of his wife and younger children, and, with several of his sons-four or five of them-went out to Kansas. He thought that the hour was approaching for the work to begin. The ballot-box had already been desecrated; the ruffians of Missouri had overwhelmed by violence the rights of the North. He went to put a stop to the insolence and violence of the South; and to him, more than any other man, we owe it that Kansas is a free State to-day. To a man of very different character-Gen. Lane-although a personal and malignant enemy of mine, I would accord the second place in this honorable rank.
Brown was not sent by any one, unless by God (as be believed,) to vindicate the rights of the North and of freedom in Kansas. He was no poli-
<c05>
tician. He despised the class with all the energy of his earnest and determined nature. His first appearance in the Territory was at Osawattomie, at a public meeting at which accommodating politicians were carefully pruning a set of resolutions to suit every shade of free State men. The motion that called him out was to pass a resolution in favor of excluding all negroes from Kansas. Old Brown rose, and scattered consternation among the politicians by asserting the manhood of the negro race, and expressing his earnest anti-slavery convictions with a force and vehemence little likely to please the hybrids then known as Free State Democrats. There were a number of Indiana Democrats present, whom his speech so shocked that they subsequently became, and remained, I believe, in the class of law en order abidin' pro-slavery men. It was his first and last appearance in a public meeting. Like most men of action, he underrated discussion. He secretly despised even the ablest anti-slavery orators. He could 'see no use in this talking,' he said. 'Talking is a national institution; but it does no good for the slave.' He thought it an excuse very well adapted for weak men with tender consciences. Most men, who were afraid to fight, and too honest to be silent, deceived themselves that they discharged their duties to the slave by denouncing in fiery words the oppressor. His ideas of duty were far different; the slaves, in his eyes, were prisoners of war; their tyrants, he held, had taken up the sword, and must perish by it.
The next time he appeared among men assembled in numbers was when Lawrence was surrounded by Sheriff Jones's posse comitalus, (from Missouri,) during the Governorship of Shannon, in the month of December, 1855. His eldest son, John, had command of a large company of men, and he himself had charge of a dozen. He was dissatisfied with the conduct of Robinson and Lane, and predicted that their celebrated treaty, with its diplomatic phraseology, would only postpone the discussion at arms, which was inevitably and rapidly approaching. Lane sent for him to a Council of War. 'Tell the General,' Brown said, 'that when he wants me to fight, to say so; but that is the only order I will obey.' In disobedience to general orders, he even went out of camp with his dozen men to meet the invaders-to 'draw a little blood,' as he phrased it; but by the special messenger of Lane, he was induced to forego this intention and return. He always regretted doing so, and maintained, that if the conflict had been brought on at that time, a great deal of bloodshed would have been spared.

Notes on the Insurrection.
While it would be unwise, and perhaps unsafe, to write in defence of the insurrectionists, by refuting the ridiculous theories that are daily advanced by the newspaper press in relation to their recent plans and ultimate intentions, I will briefly make notes, with your permission, on such miscellaneous statements as I may safely comment on without endangering my friends who are imprisoned or now pursued in the mountains of Virginia.
JOHN BROWN'S POLITICS.
First, as to John Brown's political opinions. It is asserted that he was a member of the Republican party. It is false. He despised the Republican party. Of course, he was opposed to the extension of slavery, and in favor, also, of organized political action against it. But when the Republicans cried Halt! John Brown said-FORWARD, march.! He was an Abolitionist of the Bunker Hill school. He had as little sympathy with Garrison as Seward. He believed in human brotherhood and in the God of Battles; he admired Nat Turner as well as George Washington. He could not see that it was heroic to fight against a petty tax on tea, and endure seven years of warfare for a political right, and a crime to fight in favor of restoring an outraged race to every birthright with which their Maker had endowed them, but of which the South had for two centuries robbed them. The recent outbreak was premature. The inevitable coming triumph of the Republican party, I have the best authority for stating, was the most powerful reason for this precipitate movement. The old man distrusted the Republican leaders; he said that their success would be a backward movement to the anti-slavery enterprise. His reason was, that the masses of the people had confidence in these leaders, and would believe that by their action they would ultimately and peacefully abolish slavery. That the people would be deceived, that the Republicans would become as conservative of slavery as the Democrats themselves, he sincerely-may I add, and with reason-believed? Apathy to the welfare of the slave would follow; hence it was necessary to strike a blow at once. You know the result.

CONVERSATIONS WITH BROWN.
John Brown is not a communicative man. There are numerous reports of his talks in the telegraphic bulletins, which I can pronounce, from my own knowledge of his character, as well as from other circumstances, to be total and malignant fabrications. That they contradict each other is the least certain, though an absolutely conclusive proof of their political origin; for old Brown NEVER LIES. Not to save his life, nor even to liberate the slaves, could the grand old man be induced to tell a falsehood. When Mr. Mills, 'Master of the Armory,' therefore, reported that Brown said he had 'arms and ammunition enough furnished by the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Society,' Mr. Mills, the master of the Armory, uttered a deliberate and wilful falsehood. The Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Society has never owned a solitary rifle, nor a pistol, nor a pound of ammunition, nor even-a pike! They never, therefore, sent any arms to Virginia-nor to Kansas either; now, nor at any other time.
Even the telegraph, lying as it does, is forced to contradict the Master of the Armory, on Brown's authority, on this important point. Read:
'REPORTER-Where did you get all the rifles and pikes which are here? Who furnished you with them?
'BROWN-My own money. I did not receive aid from any man.'

GERRIT SMITH'S LETTER.
This reply is in apparent contradiction to the evidence sought to be established by the publication of a letter from Gerrit Smith. There is no manner of evidence in it that Mr. Smith is implicated in this insurrection. It is dated June 4. It gives money to the 'Kansas work.' What was that work? It is clearly enough stated in the letter of old Brown, in which he drew his celebrated 'parallels.' He went into the house of bondage in Missouri, and restored to their birth-rights twelve human beings. The Southern and Democratic presses howled long and loudly at the righteous act. A few months before, a gang of murderers, from Missouri, crossed the Kansas line, and perpetrated the odious massacre of the Mer des Cwignes. The Southern and Democratic presses laughed in derision, or attempted to gloss over the infernal act.
He was at that time supposed to have enlisted for life in the work of liberating the slave. He stated so, himself, to every one with whom he spoke on the
<c06>
subject; and said that he was willing to accept money to advance the cause of freedom; but on the condition that donations thus given should be placed absolutely and without directions, at his own disposal to be employed as he saw fit. He did not proclaim his intentions of inciting an Insurrection to very one. No man ever lived more prudent than he: I assert this fact, boldly, in spite of the seeming insanity of his recent attempt at Harper's Ferry. We have only heard one side of that story thus far; when we shall have heard the other, and know why the rebellion broke out so suddenly and fatally, we shall see, I have no manner of doubt, that Brown's common sense did not desert him in that unfortunate affair. It is an unforeseen accident that frequently decides the fate of battles and conspiracies. Brown undoubtedly was betrayed, or in danger of arrest; and was compelled to precipitate the seizure of the Armory.
Gerrit Smith, I have no doubt-although I do not know it-gives his money to liberate the slaves by the agency of underground railroads. What decent man would not?
I know that Gerrit Smith disapproves of insurrections. When Mr. A. B. Burdick, of New York, last spring, published a book of mine, called 'The Roving Editor; or Talks with Slaves in the Southern States,' (which I dedicated to John Brown, and in which I clearly foretold his intentions,) Mr. Smith wrote to him, that he was glad that I had inscribed the volume to the Captain, who was 'an old and valued friend,' but that my book, although 'not too bold' was 'too bloody' to suit him. He wrote to me that he had long feared that slavery would end in blood; but he could not contemplate so terrible a result with complacency. My reply to him, concluded with all the respect I feel for his noble life, was somewhat to this effect: That I thought any result, no matter how sanguinary in its progress, was infinitely preferable to the death-sleep of slavery, and the foul stain on the nation's escutcheon, which its continuance made. 
If, however, Gerrit Smith repented of his views, and was converted to my creed, I have no hesitation in declaring that he will boldly avow it. He is neither a coward nor a politician, that he should seek to conceal his opinions.

THE HARPER'S FERRY OUTBREAK.
On Tuesday afternoon, 18th inst., Senator Mason, Col. Faulkner, (member of Congress, who lives a few miles from Harper's Ferry,) Mr. Vallandigham, (member of Congress from Ohio,) and other gentlemen, had a conversation with Old Brown while he lay in the Armory. A reporter of the New York Herald was present, and reports the questions and answers verbatim. We copy at length:
Mr. Mason-Can you tell us, at least, who furnished money for your expedition?
Mr. Brown-I furnished most of it myself. I cannot implicate others. It is my own folly that I have been taken. I could easily have saved myself from it had I exercised my own better judgment, rather than yielded to my feelings.
Mr. Mason-You mean, if you bad escaped immediately?
Mr. Brown-No; I had the means to make myself secure without any escape, but I allowed myself to be surrounded by a force by being too tardy.
Mr. Mason-Tardy in getting away?
Mr. Brown-I should have gone away, but I had thirty odd prisoners, whose wives and daughters were in tears for their safety, and I felt for them. Besides, I wanted to allay the fears of those who believed we came here to burn and kill. For this reason, I allowed the train to cross the bridge, and gave them full liberty to pass on. I did it only to spare the feelings of those passengers and their families, and to allay the apprehensions that you had got here in your vicinity a band of men who had no regard for life and property, nor any feeling of humanity.
Mr. Mason-But you killed some people passing along the streets quietly.
Mr. Brown-Well, sir, if there was anything of that kind done, it was without my knowledge. Your own citizens, who were my prisoners, will tell you that every possible means were taken to prevent it. I did not allow my men to fire, nor even to return a fire, when there was danger of killing those we regarded as innocent persons, if I could help it. They will tell you that we allowed ourselves to be fired at repeatedly, and did not return it.
A Bystander-That is not so. You killed an unarmed man at the corner of the house over there, (at the water tank,) and another besides. 
Mr. Brown-See here, my friend, it is needless to dispute, or contradict the report of your own neighbors, who were my prisoners.
Mr. Mason-If you would tell us who sent you here-who provided the means-that would be information of some value.
Mr. Brown-I will answer freely and faithfully about what concerns myself-I will answer anything I can with honor, but not about others.
Mr. Vallandigham (member of Congress from Ohio, who had entered)-Mr. Brown, who sent you here?
Mr. Brown-No man sent me here; it was my own prompting, and that of my Maker, or that of the devil, whichever you please to ascribe it to. I acknowledge no man in human form.
Mr. Vallandigham-Did you get up the expedition yourself?
Mr. Brown-I did.
Mr. Vallandigham-Did you get up this document that is called a Constitution?
Mr. Brown-I did. They are a Constitution and ordinances of my own contriving and getting up.
Mr. Vallandigham-How long have you been engaged in this business?
Mr. Brown-From the breaking out of the difficulties in Kansas. Four of my sons had gone there to settle, and they induced me to go. I did not go there to settle, but because of the difficulties.
Mr. Mason-How many are engaged with you in this movement? I ask these questions for our own safety.
Mr. Brown-Any questions that I can honorably answer, I will, not otherwise. So far as I am myself concerned, I have told everything truthfully. I value my word, sir.
Mr. Mason-What was your in object in coming?
Mr. Brown-We came to free the slaves, and only that.
A Young Man (in the uniform of a volunteer company)-How many men in all had you? 
Mr. Brown-I came to Virginia with eighteen men only, besides myself.
Volunteer-What in the world did you suppose you could do here in Virginia with that amount of men?
Mr. Brown-Young man, I don't wish to discuss that question here.
Volunteer-You could not do anything.
Mr. Brown-Well, perhaps your ideas and mine on military subjects would differ materially.
Mr. Mason How do you justify your acts?
Mr. Brown- I think, my friend, you are guilty of a great wrong against God and humanity-I say it without wishing to be offensive-and it would be perfectly right for any one to interfere with you, so
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
The United States Constitution is 'a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell.'
'The free States are the guardians and essential supports of slavery. We are the jailers and constables of the institution.... There is some excuse for communities, when, under a generous impulse, they espouse the cause of the oppressed in other States, and by force restore their rights; but they are without excuse is aiding other States in binding on men an unrighteous yoke. On this subject, OUR FATHERS, IN FRAMING THE CONSTITUTION, SWERVED FROM THE RIGHT. We their children, at the end of half a century, see the path of duty more clearly than they, and must walk in it. To this point the public mind has long been tending, and the time has come for looking at it fully, dispassionately, and with manly and Christian resolution.... No blessing of the Union can be a compensation for taking part in the enslaving of our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to be perpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that it can only continue through our participation in wrong doing. To this conviction the free States are tending.'-WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING.

far as to free those you wilfully and wickedly hold in bondage. I do not say this insultingly.
Mr. Mason-I understand that.
Mr. Brown-I think I did right, and that others will do right who interfere with you at any time and all times. I hold that the Golden Rule, ' Do unto others as you would that others should do unto you,' applies to all who would help others to gain their liberty.
Lieut. Stewart-But you don't believe in the Bible.
Mr. Brown-Certainly I do.
Mr. Vallandigham-Where did your men come from? Did some of them come from Ohio?
Mr. Brown�Some of them.
Mr. Vallandigham�From the Western Reserve? None came from Southern Ohio. 
Mr. Brown�Yes, I believe one came from below Steubenville. down not far from Wheeling. 
Mr. Vallandigham�Have you been in Ohio this summer?
Mr. Brown�Yes, sir.
Mr. Vallandigham�How lately?
Mr. Brown�I passed through to Pittsburgh on my way in June.
Mr. Vallandigham�Were you at any county or State fair there?
Mr. Brown�I was not; not since June.
Mr. Mason�Did you consider this a military organization, in this paper (the Constitution)? I have not yet read it.
Mr. Brown�I did, in some sense. I wish you would give that paper close attention.
Mr. Mason�You considered yourself the Commander-in-Chief of these ' provisional' military forces.
Mr. Brown�I was chosen, agreeably to the ordinance of a certain document, Commander-in-Chief of that force.
Mr. Mason�What wages did you offer?
Mr. Brown�None.
Lieut. Stewart�' The wages of sin is death.'
Mr. Brown�I would not have made such a remark to you, if you had been a prisoner and wounded in my hands.
A Bystander�Did you not promise a negro in Gettysburg twenty dollars a month?
Mr. Brown�I did not.
Bystander�He says you did.
Mr. Vallandigham�Were you ever in Dayton, Ohio?
Mr. Brown�Yes, I must have been. 
Mr. Vallandigham�Thin summer?
Mr. Brown�No, a year or two since.
Mr. Mason�Does this talking annoy you?
Mr. Brown�Not the least.
Mr. Vallandigham�Have you lived long in Ohio?
Mr. Brown�I went there in 1850; I lived in Summit county, which was then Trumbull county; my native place is in York State; my father lived there till his death, in 1805.
Mr. Vallandigham�Do you recollect a man in Ohio named Brown, a noted counterfeiter?
Mr. Brown�I do: I knew him from a boy; his father was Henry Brown; they were of Irish or Scotch descent, and he had a brother also engaged in that business; when boys, they could not read or write; they were of a very low family.
Mr. Vallandigham�Have you been in Portage county lately?
Mr. Brown�I was there in June last.
Mr. Vallandigham�When in Cleveland, did you attend the Fugitive Slave Law Convention there? 
Mr. Brown�No. I was there about the time of the sitting of the court to try the Oberlin rescuers. I spoke there publicly on that subject. I spoke of the Fugitive Slave Law and ray own rescue. Of course, so far as I had any influence at all, I was disposed to justify the Oberlin people for rescuing the slave, because I have myself forcibly taken slaves from bondage. I was concerned in taking eleven slaves from Missouri to Canada last winter. I think I spoke in Cleveland before the Convention. I not know that I had any conversation with any of the Oberlin rescuers. I was sick part of the time I was in Ohio with the ague. I was part of the time in Ashtabula county.
Mr. Vallandigham�Did you see any thing of Joshua R. Giddings there?
Mr. Brown�I did meet him.
Mr. Vallandigham�Did you converse with him?
Mr. Brown�I did. I .would not tell you, of course, any thing that would implicate Mr. Giddings; but I certainly met with him, and had conversations with him.
Mr. Vallandigham�About that rescue case?
Mr. Brown�Yes, I did; I heard him express his opinions upon it very freely and frankly.
Mr. Vallandigham�Justifying it? 
Mr. Brown�Yes, sir; I do not compromise him certainly by saying that.
A Bystander�Did you go out to Kansas under the auspices of the Emigrant Aid Society?
Mr. Brown�No, sir; I went out under the auspices of John Brown, and nobody else.
Mr. Vallandigham�Will you answer this: Did you talk with Giddings about your expedition here?
Mr. Brown�No, I won't answer that, because a denial of it I would not make, and to make any affirmation of it, I should be a great dunce.
Mr. Vallandigham�Have you had any correspondence with parties at the North on the subject of this movement?
Mr. Brown�I have had correspondence.
A Bystander�Do you consider this a religious movement?
Mr. Brown�It is, in my opinion, the greatest service a man can render to God.
Bystander�Do you consider yourself an instrument in the hands of Providence? 
Mr. Brown�I do. 
Bystander�Upon what principle do you justify your acts? 
Mr. Brown�Upon the Golden Rule. I pity the poor in bondage that have none to help them; that u why I am here; not to gratify any personal animosity, revenge or vindictive spirit. It is my sympathy with the oppressed and the wronged, that are as good as you, and as precious in the sight of God.
Bystander�Certainly. But why take the Blares! against their will? 
Mr. Brown�I never did.
Bystander�You did in one instance, at least.
Stephens, the other wounded prisoner, here said, in a firm, clear voice�'You are right. In one case, I know, the negro wanted to go back.'
A Bystander�Where did you come from?
Mr. Stephens�I lived in Ashtabula country, Ohio.
Mr. Vallandigham�How recently did you leave Ashtabula country?
Mr. Stephens�Some months ago. I never resided there any length of time; have been through there.
Mr. Vallandigham�How far did you live from Jefferson?
Mr. Brown�Be cautious, Stephens, about any answers that would commit any friend. I would not answer that.
Stephens turned partially over with a groan of pain, and was silent.
Mr. Vallandigham (to Mr. Brown )�Who are your advisers in this movement?
Mr. Brown�I cannot answer that. I have numerous sympathizers throughout the entire North.
Mr. Vallandigham�In northern Ohio?
Mr. Brown�No more than any where else; in all the free States.
Mr. Vallandigham�But you are not personally acquainted in southern Ohio?
Mr. Brown �Not very much.
Mr. Vallandigham (to Stephens)�Were you at the Convention last June?
Stephens�I was.
Mr. Vallandigham (to Brown)�You made a speech there?
Mr. Brown�I did, sir.
A Bystander�Did you ever live in Washington city?
Mr. Brown�I did not. I want yon to understand, gentlemen�(and to the reporter of the Herald,) you may report that�I want you to understand, that I respect the rights of the poorest and weakest of colored people, oppressed by the slave system, just as much u I do those of the most wealthy and powerful. That is the idea that has moved me, and that alone. We expected no reward, except the satisfaction of endeavoring to do for those in distress and greatly oppressed as we would be done by. The cry of distress of the oppressed is my reason, and the only thing that prompted me to come here.'
A Bystander.�Why did yon do it secretly?
Mr. Brown�Because I thought that necessary to success; no other reason.
Bystander� And you think that honorable? Have you read Gerrit Smith's last latter?
Mr. Brown�What letter do mean?
Bystander-The New York Herald of yesterday,
<C02>
in speaking of this affair, mentions a letter in this way:�' Apropos to this exciting news, we recollect a very significant passage in one of Gerrit Smiths letters, published a month or two ago, in which he speaks of the folly of attempting to strike the shackles off the slaves by the force of moral suasion or legal agitation, and predicts that the next movement made in the direction of negro emancipation would be an insurrection in the South.'
Mr. Brown�I have not seen the New York Herald for several days past; but I presume from your remarks about the gist of the letter that I should concur with it. I agree with Mr. Smith that moral suasion is hopeless. I don't think the people of the slave States will ever consider the subject of slavery in its true light till some other argument is resorted to than moral suasion.
Mr. Vallandigham�Did you expect a general rising of the slaves in case of your success?
Mr. Brown�No, sir; nor did I wish it; I expected to gather them up from time to time, and set them free.
Mr. Vallandigham�Did you expect to hold possession here till then?
Mr. Brown�Well, probably I had quite a different idea. I do not know that I ought to reveal my plans. I am here a prisoner and wounded, because I foolishly allowed myself to be so. You overrate your strength in supposing I could have been taken if I had not allowed it. I was too tardy after commencing the open attack�in delaying my movements through Monday night, and up to the time I was attacked by the government troops. It was all occasioned by my desire to spare the feelings of my prisoners and their families, and the community at large. I had no knowledge of the shooting of the negro (Heywood.)
Mr. Vallandigham�What time did you commence your organization in Canada?
Mr. Brown�That occurred about two years ago, if I remember right. It was, I think, in 1858.
Mr. Vallandigham�Who was the Secretary?
Mr. Brown�That I would not tell if I recollected, but I do not recollect. I think the officers were elected in May, 1858. I may answer incorrectly, but not intentionally. My head is a little confused by wounds, and my memory obscure on dates, &c.
Dr. Biggs�Were you in the party at Dr. Kennedy's house?
Mr. Brown�I was the head of that party. I occupied the house to mature my plans. I have not been in Baltimore to purchase caps.
Dr. Biggs�What was the number of men at Kennedy's?
Mr. Brown�I decline to answer that.
Dr. Biggs�Who lanced that woman's neck on the hill?
Mr. Brown�I did. I have sometimes practiced in surgery when I thought it a matter of humanity and necessity, and there was no one else to do it, but have not studied surgery.
Dr. Biggs�It was done very well and scientifically. They have been very clever to the neighbors, I have been told, and we had no reason to suspect them, except that we could not understand their movements. They were represented as eight or nine persons; on Friday there were thirteen.
Mr. Brown�There were more than that.
Q. Where did you get arms to obtain possession of the armory? A. I bought them.
Q. In what State? A. That I would not state.
Q How many guns? A. Two hundred Sharp's rifles and two hundred revolvers�what is called the Massachusetts Arms Company's revolvers, a little under the navy size.
Q. Why did you not take that swivel you left in the house? A. I had no occasion for it. It was given to me a year or two ago.
Q. In Kansas? A. No, I had nothing given me in Kansas.
Q. By whom, and in what State? A. I decline to answer. It is not properly a swivel; it is a very large rifle, with a pivot. The ball is larger than a musket ball; it is intended for a slug.
Reporter of the Herald�I do not wish to annoy you; but if you have anything further you would like to say, I will report it.
Mr. Brown�I have nothing to say, only that I claim to be here in carrying out a measure I believe perfectly justifiable, and not to act the part of an incendiary or ruffian, but to aid those suffering great wrong. I wish to say, furthermore, that you had better�all you people at the South�prepare yourselves for a settlement of that question that must come up for settlement sooner than you are prepared for it. The sooner you are prepared, the better. You may dispose of me very easily. I am nearly disposed of now; but this question is still to be settled�this negro question, I mean; the end of that is not yet. These wounds were inflicted on me�both sabre cuts on my head and bayonet stabs in different parts of my body�some minutes after I had ceased fighting, and had consented to a surrender, for the benefit of others, not for my own. (This statement was vehemently denied by all around.) I believe the Major (meaning Lieut. J. B. Stuart of the United States Cavalry,) would not have been alive; I could have killed him just as easy as a mosquito when he came in, but I supposed he came in only to receive our surrender. There had been loud and long cries of 'Surrender ' from us�as loud as men could yell�but in the confusion and excitement, I suppose we were not heard. I do not think the Major, or anyone, meant to butcher us after we had surrendered.
An officer here stated that the orders to the marines were not to shoot anybody; but when they were fired upon by Browns men, and one of them killed, they were obliged to return the compliment.
Mr. Brown insisted that the marines fired first.
An Officer�Why did not you surrender before the attack?
Mr. Brown�I did not think it was my duty or interest to do so. We assured the prisoners that we did not wish to harm them, and they should he set at liberty. I exercised my best judgment, not believing the people would want only sacrifice their own fellow-citizens, when we offered to let them goon being allowed to change our position about a quarter of a mile. The prisoners agreed by vote among themselves to pass across the bridge with us. We wanted them only as a guaranty of our own safety, that we should not be tired into. We took them in the first place as hostages, and to keep them from doing any harm. We did kill some men in defending ourselves, but I saw no one fire except directly in self-defence. Our orders were strict not to harm any one not in arms against us.
Q. Brown, suppose you had every nigger in the United States, what would you do with them? A. Set them free.
Q. Your intention was to carry them off, and free them? A. Not at all.
A Bystander�To set them free would sacrifice the life of every man in this community.
Mr. Brown�I do not think so.
Bystander�I know it. I think you are fanatical.
Mr. Brown�And I think you are fanatical.�' Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad,' and you are mad.
Q. Was it your only object to free the negroes? A. Absolutely our only object.
Q. But you demanded and took Col. Washington's silver and watch? A. Yes; we intended freely to appropriate the property of slaveholders to carryout our object. It was for that, and only that, and with no desire to enrich ourselves with any plunder whatever.
Q. Did you know Sherrod in Kansas? I understand you killed him. A. I killed no man except in fair fight; I fought at Black Jack Point and Ossawattomie, and if I killed anybody, it was at one of these places.
BROWN'S APPEARANCE. The reporter of the Baltimore American, who gives a lengthened account of a conversation with Capt. Brown, in which Senator Mason and others took part, prefaces his report with the following sketch:�
'After some little delay, we were introduced in the room where Brown and Stevens lay. Brown has a rather peculiar shaped head, long gray hair, which at this time was matted, the sabre cut in his head having caused blood to flow freely, to the complete disfigurement of his face, which, like his bands, was begrimmed with dirt, evidently the result of continued exposure to the smoke of powder. His eyes are of a pale blue, or perhaps a sharp grey� much such an eye as I remember his brother fillibuster, Walker, to have. During his conversation, hereafter reported, no sign of weakness was exhibited. In the midst of enemies, whose home he had invaded; wounded and a prisoner, surrounded by a small army of officials, and a more desperate army of angry men; with the gallows staring him full in the iace, he lay on the floor, and, in reply to every question, gave answers that betokened the spirit that animated him. The language of Gov. Wise well expressed his boldness when he said, ' He is the gamest man I ever saw.'
<c03>
CARD FROM HON. JOSHUA R. GIDDINGS.
While coming to this city, on Saturday, I first read a telegraph dispatch from Washington, saying 'that John Brown (the prisoner captured at Harper's Ferry,) refused, in the presence of Senator Mason and Messrs. Vallandigham, to answer the question, whether he had consulted Mr. Giddings about his Virginia expedition? '
It is evident that the object of these gentlemen was not to obtain facts on which to predicate a charge of crime, or of any immoral or dishonorable act. Had such been their object, they would not have published what was not said; but they proclaim their suspicions, and by such inuendoes and insinuations, seek to impugn the character of one who was not present. 
I do not feel called upon to reply to such attempts to cast reproach upon myself. I say to these questioners, Gentlemen. I am your peer. I have served my country as long, and I hope as honestly, as either of you; and you know, and the country knows, that any question you may propound to me touching the Government, its past or present position, will be frankly, promptly and fully answered, to the extent; of my knowledge and belief; and I pronounce this attempt to assail me dishonorable, unworthy of your positions, unworthy of honorable men.
But you must not expect to escape the responsibility of your own conduct by thus assailing one who bas for years cautioned you of the results that must follow the efforts of yourselves and party to extend slavery, and your determined purpose to involve the people of the Free States in the disgrace and crime of supporting an institution which all honest and independent men of those States repudiate. No man of our nation has done more than one of you to produce the results which have recently attracted the attention of the people. They are the immediate and unmistakable effects of the efforts of yourselves and party to establish slavery in Kansas. Murderers there were rewarded by executive appointments to office. Brown's sons were the victims of that despotism which your party exerted in favor of an institution which the people abhorred.
These facts do not rest on suspicion, nor on the refusal of, a victim to answer any question. They rest upon the records and the history of the government itself. No evasion, no tergiversation, can change the enduring truths to which I refer. And you would better subserve the public good by exerting your influence and occupying your time in correcting the evils you and your party have brought upon the country, than by vain efferts to involve others in the crimes which you and your associates have committed.
To the public I will say, that Brown never consulted me in regard to his Virginia expedition, or any other expedition or matter whatever.
J. R. GIDDINGS.
Girard House, Philad., Oct. 24, 1859.
THE LIBERATOR.
BOSTON, OCTOBER 28, 1859.
THE TRAGEDY AT HARPER'S FERRY.
We have devoted a large portion of our present number to the publication of such particulars of the well-intended but sadly misguided effort of Capt. John Brown and his score of confederates, at Harper's Ferry, to liberate the slaves in Virginia, and ultimately throughout the South, as have been received; with the comments of various Democratic and Republican journals upon this outbreak, which are characterized by an equal mixture of ferocity and cowardice.
As to the plot itself, it is evident that few or none were privy to it, except the little hand directly engaged in it; for though Capt. Brown had many to sympathize with him, in different parts of the country, in view of his terrible bereavements, perils and sufferings in Kansas, in defence of the freedom of that territory against Border Ruffian invasion, and were disposed to contribute not only to relieve his necessities, but also to facilitate the escape of slaves through his instrumentality to Canada, still an enterprise so wild and futile as this could not have received any countenance in that direction.
As to Capt. Brown, all who know him personally are united in the conviction that a more honest, conscientious, truthful, brave, disinterested man, (however misguided or unfortunate,) does not exist; that he possesses a deeply religious nature, powerfully wrought upon by the trials through which he has passed; that he as sincerely believes himself to have been raised up by God to deliver the oppressed in this , ' country, in the way he has chosen, as did Moses in relation to the deliverance of the captive Israelites; that when he says, he aims to be guided by the Golden Rule, it is no cant from his lips, but a vital application of it to his own soul, 'remembering those that are in bonds as bound with them'; that when he affirms, that he had no other motive for his conduct at Harper's Ferry, except to break the chains of the oppressed, by the shedding of the least possible amount of human blood, he speaks ' the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth'; and that if he shall be (as he will speedily, beyond a peradventure) put to death, he will not die ignobly, but as a martyr to his sympathy for a suffering race, and in defence of the sacred and inalienable rights of man, and will therefore deserve to be held in grateful and honorable remembrance to the latest posterity by all those who glory in the deeds of a Wallace or Tell, a Washington or Warren. Read his replies to the interrogatories propounded to him by Senator Mason and others! Is there another man, of all the thirty millions of people inhabiting this country, who could have answered more wisely, more impressively, more courageously, or with greater moral dignity, under such a trying ordeal? How many hearts will be thrilled and inspired by his utterances! Read, too, his replies in court with reference to his counsel! Where shall a more undaunted spirit be found? In vain will the sanguinary tyrants of the South, and their Northern minions, seek to cover him with infamy:�
'Courts, judges can inflict no brand of shame,
Or shape of death, to shroud him from applause.'
For, by the logic of Concord, Lexington and Bunker Hill, and by the principles enforced by this nation in its boasted Declaration of Independence, Capt. Brown was a hero, struggling against fearful odds, not for his own advantage, but to redeem others from a horrible bondage, to be justified in all that he aimed to achieve, however lacking in sound discretion. And by the same logic and the same principles, every slaveholder has forfeited his right to live, if his destruction be necessary to enable his victims to break the yoke of bondage; and they, and all who are disposed to aid them by force and arms, are fully warranted in carrying rebellion to any extent, and securing freedom at whatever cost.
It will be a terribly losing day for all Slavedom when John Brown and his associates are brought to the gallows. It will be sowing seed broadcast for a harvest of retribution. Their blood will cry trumpet-tongued from the ground, and that cry will be responded to by tens of thousands in a manner that shall cause the knees of the Southern slave-mongers to smite together as did those of Belshazzar of old! O that they might avoid all this by a timely repentance!
The New York Journal of Commerce, with its characteristic mendacity, says that the Liberator, last week, preserved an ominous silence upon the Harper's Ferry ' rebellion'! Now, the truth is, that we spoke of it as a wild though well-meant effort, adding� � Our views of war and bloodshed, even in the best of causes, are too well known to need repeating here; BUT LET NO ONE WHO GLORIES IN THE REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE OF 1776 DENY THE RIGHT OF THE SLAVES TO IMITATE THE EXAMPLE OF OUR FATHERS.' It was all the comment we could find room to make, because of the pre-occupancy of our columns; but in the longest article upon the subject, what more could we say to define our position on the one hand, or to rebuke the hypocritical villany of the Journal of Commerce on the other?
<C04>
JOHN BROWN, AND HIS MOVEMENT.
The telegraph has reported, and the periodical press has circulated throughout the country, details of intense interest respecting this man, and the daring adventure which has left him in the hands of bitter and relentless enemies, bereft of resources, and threatened with speedy death.
What is to be said of him, and of?
First, and most important, what is to be said of his character and his motive? Is he honest or false, interested or selfish, noble or vile? Was his purpose a good purpose?
The history of Kansas, reported in the newspapers from year to year, has told us much of the actions and the sufferings of one who was familiarly known there as 'Old man Brown,' and Ossawatomie Brown,' and more details respecting him have recently been published in the Atlas and Bee, by a perfectly competent and trustworthy witness, Mr. James Redpath. The same moral characteristics appear, the same purpose is manifest, in his conduct at Kansas and during his late residence in Virginia.
In the whole history of this country, no man has appeared of sterner integrity, of truer nobleness of soul, of more hearty devotion to what he considered right, or of more unselfish desires and more assiduous labors for the benefit of others. His whole life has shown him to be one of God's nobility, and his serious, earnest demeanor, on the only occasion when I had the pleasure of seeing him, well corresponded with that character. His aspect and bearing, his speech and action took hold of the hearts of those who possessed any corresponding nobleness, and kindled hearty affection as well as deference and respect among his associates. He was a man to be loved and trusted as well as to be obeyed. Such is the testimony of those who knew him best.
His purpose in going to Kansas seems to have been to support his family by honest labor, in a place where he could also take an active part in confirming free institutions, and averting the curse of slavery from a State then in the process of formation. Disappointed in the first of these pursuits by the marauding army of Border Ruffians, who burnt his house, murdered his sons, and desolated his home, (and all these as mere steps towards the extermination of freedom, and the permanent establishment of slavery,) he seems to have devoted himself wholly to the second, and to have lived, thenceforth, with no selfish or private purpose, but wholly for the defence and relief of those who were yet more oppressed than himself. With this view he went to Virginia.
The picture of the Good Samaritan will live to all, future ages, eulogized by Jesus as the model of human excellence for helping one whom he chanced to find in need. John Brown did more than this, and emulated the example of the beneficent Savior himself, for he went to seek those who were lost, that he might save them. I know no more noble instance of the combination of disinterested affection with exalted heroism, than the voluntary consecration, by this strong, free, intelligent man, of all his powers, and the labors of his whole life, in behalf of the most needy and unfortunate of human beings.
La Fayette has won unbounded praise and gratitude, and a lofty place in the records of history, by volunteering his services in behalf of an oppressed people, at the darkest hour in their fortunes, and with every prospect of losing what he risked in their behalf. He offered his aid in this desperate crisis, and came hither when it was accepted. It was a noble act, and the glory which has followed his success is no more than he has fully deserved. But John Brown did far more. He voluntarily devoted his labors, the toils and sufferings of a life, to those who were so oppressed that they could not receive a message from him, or send an answer to him. The people for whom he was planning and toiling could not give him even gratitude, for they did not know of his existence; and each one whom he succeeded in delivering saw him only for an instant, as he despatched them, under cloud of night, through dangers which his care had diminished, towards a liberty which he risked for himself, that he might secure it for them.
Then the amount, and the sort, of danger incurred, how different in these two cases! The risk of life was common to both, but neither esteemed this earthly life his most precious possession. La Fayette had not only the consciousness of a lofty, noble, chivalrous position, the satisfaction of fighting an open combat, on the side acknowledged to be right, in the gaze of an admiring world�
'But the stern joy which warriors feel
'In foemen worthy of their steel.'
He was combatting a civilized nation, which respected rank like his, even in an enemy, and which, in the event of his imprisonment, would have given him honorable treatment and ultimate release.
How unspeakably greater the danger, how much more fearful the risks, to which John Brown subjected himself! Think, reader, what it is to go to live in Virginia for the purpose of helping the slaves! It is to pass one's life among bandits for the chance of being able to help those whom they have plundered. It is to live surrounded by a brutal, ignorant, vulgar and vicious population, regardless alike of honor and justice, of humanity and religion; to have one's life and conversation among a people who despise benevolence, mock at the Golden Rule, ignore even such manliness as an English pugilist practises, strike a man when he is down, get their livelihood by robbery, find their enjoyment in drunkenness. It is to live among a people who, being constantly in the wrong, are constantly deserving reprisals, and constantly fearing them; and who, ever suspicious of a stranger, are wont to count their suspicions as evidence, and at short notice to inflict upon him such personal indignity, brutal abuse, and privation of liberty as they habitually bestow upon the slaves'; and with whom it is customary to punish humanity worse than in civilized countries they do crime.
The purpose of John Brown was, at his own expense, and at enormous and fearful risk to himself, to help the slaves to freedom. It was a noble purpose, and will receive the plaudit of every manly and generous heart.
The braggart buffoon who appropriately holds the Governor's chair in the slave-breeding State of Virginia, said, in his Richmond speech, that Brown made a great mistake in supposing that the slaves wished to escape; and thereupon he proceeded to offer a reward of $1000 for the apprehension of one of Brown's associates who had escaped, to send multitudes of armed men scouring the mountains in pursuit of him, and to urge the importance of the organization of military throughout the State, and the exercise of great vigilance against similar movements hereafter!!!
At the North, if a person should come stealthily from abroad to whisper to our working men that they could find better wages and a pleasanter situation elsewhere, and they should reject his proposition, saying that they were perfectly satisfied here, we should not think it necessary to offer a thousand dollars for his head, or to proceed to the organization of additional bodies of military, or to recommend great vigilance to guard against the repetition of such suggestions!
Sapient Wise! The cause of the slaveholders is so desperate, that neither truth nor moderately probable lies will answer its necessities. But will it help the matter for the Governor of the Ancient Dominion to tell lies so preposterously absurd that their falseness is stamped upon their face?
It appears that John Brown's motive and purpose were the highest and the noblest. What is to be said of his method?
Brown is regarded by those who knew him best as a person of great prudence, caution and good judgment, as well as great boldness. These qualities do not appear in the transactions at Harper's Ferry. He effected there not only no good commensurate with
<c05>
the greatness of the preparations, bat no good whatever. The negroes who were associated with him were either killed, or fell again into the hands of their oppressors. How many he had helped to a secure escape before, how many he had reasonable hope of delivering, if his plan of operations had succeeded, we have no means of judging, because we do not know what that plan was. It is conjectured that some accident or some treachery brought on this outbreak before his plans were matured, even so far as to be intelligibly made known by his failure. We are therefore unable to say precisely how far he was imprudent in this undertaking. One feature, however, of his method of operations appears too plainly to be mistaken, namely, the collection of large quantities of arms, and the expectation, in emergencies more or less probable, of a bloody conflict. The American Anti-Slavery Society, and its organ, the Anti-Slavery Standard, and its ally, the Liberator, have always earnestly endeavored to dissuade the slaves and their helpers from this method of vindicating their rights. All bloody and violent methods of opposition to slavery have been uniformly discouraged by the Abolitionists, in general, on the ground of policy, prudence, and probability of success, and, by those of their number who are non-resistants, on the ground of principle. In this dissuasion, for both these reasons, I most heartily and fully concur.
First, as to the lower ground, that of prudence and good judgment: it is absurd to fight when the party in question is so small, or so ill provided, that it will certainly lose what it fights for. The slaves of this country (though their cause for fighting is as good, and ten times more urgent, than that of our revolutionary fathers) are so destitute of money, arms, stores, leaders, knowledge, of various indispensable kinds, and opportunities of concert and combination, that no individual insurrectionary movement offers he slightest probability of success, even to those engaged in it, while the condition of the slaves around them is rendered far worse by their movement, whether for themselves it be a success or a failure. 'The sons of Zeruiah are yet too hard for them.' The one single advantage which insurrectionary movements contribute towards the grand object of the overthrow of slavery�namely, the renewed demonstration which they give of the insecurity of tyrants, making every slaveholder's life a succession of alarms, suspicions and panic terrors�is not sufficient to counterbalance their many evils. I think that no intelligent friend of the slave, even if he be a fighting man, can advise them to fight, with the expectation that they will thus retain their lives and regain their liberty.
But there is a higher and nobler ground than this, which urges yet more forcibly to the same conclusion. As the Anti-Slavery movement is a great religious enterprise, seeking a Christian end by Christian means�as it proposes in no case to render evil for evil, but always to seek to overcome evil with good�so its advocates desire and counsel that the slaves use only Christian means by which to work out their deliverance. The word Christian has been so misused and perverted by a pro-slavery clergy, that when Abolitionists use it in this connection, it is necessary to explain and define. I therefore premise that I repudiate with indignation the idea that Christianity requires any human being patiently to acquiesce in enslavement. The ' liberty with which Christ makes free' includes no such stupidity as the duty of consenting to be chained, and beaten, and treated as a beast of burden. 'The glorious liberty of the children of God' authorises its possessor to cast off Legree's or Netherland's chain not less than Sa-tan's chain. Every slave, Christian or not, has a right, in virtue of his human body and soul, to declare his freedom, and to take his freedom. But this right does not include, nor extend to, the killing of his tyrant, were he as bad as Netherland himself; and the Christian system expressly forbids us to use such means, even for to good an end. According to that system, evil is to be overcome with good, never with corresponding evil. Wound for wound, stripe for stripe, life for life, are provisions belonging to the barbarous and obsolete Jewish system; the Christian code says�Render not evil for evil. And this I hold to be the true, the just and the obligatory law, holding jurisdiction alike over slave and freeman.
Judging, feeling obliged by my allegiance to truth and righteousness to judge, by this standard, I must say of the shedding of blood at Harper's Ferry, as of that at Lexington and Bunker Hill, that it is not the right way to maintain a good cause. To take, and hold, one's liberty, without either taking revenge or inflicting injury, or, if need be, to die rather than submit to the base condition of a slave, this is well; all honor to him or to her who firmly takes and inflexibly adheres to this position. To gain one's freedom by killing the kidnapper is to do evil that good may come. But if Brown is not to be praised for fighting, even for liberty, what is to be said of Wise, and the military ruffians of the Slave Power, who shed blood in defence of slavery? What, but that they are as much worse than the Priest and the Levite who passed by on the other side, as they were worse than the Good Samaritan?� C. K. W.
FOURTH FRATERNITY LECTURE.
An excellent lecture on 'Modern Infidelity' was given on Tuesday evening, to a crowded audience, by George William Curtis. It performed the very important service to the community of giving an accurate statement of the form and substance of the thing which is now-a-days popularly called ' infidelity.' Of real infidelity, a disbelief in the existence of God, Mr. Curtis said he should not speak, as he supposed it to be a very rare thing, and one with which his audience had no concern. The lecture was an effective vindication of the right of private judgment and free inquiry, and it well described the error, common to all sects, of insisting that this road, so excellent, so commodious, so needful to the public welfare, and answering their own purpose so perfectly as far as they have journeyed on it, has its terminus just at that point. The road, they say, is admirable and indispensable so far, but whoever presumes to go further, in a line continuous with it, is sure to go wrong, and is, moreover, an 'infidel.' So the charge of infidelity (an clerically and popularly used) really means only this�You are wicked enough to dare to think differently from me!
The word Protestant, like the word Christian before it, and the word Methodist after it, had been originally used as a term of reproach; the name, from the lapse of time and the associations connected with venerated ancestors, has become reputable and even honorable, but the thing, the protest of reform at the present day against popular vice or popular error, is stigmatized as much as ever, and the supporters of the vice or the error retort by hurling back the cry of 'Infidel'; and this barbed dart, this indefinite but venomed vituperation, is flung with equal spite, in our own age, against the opposer of superstition and the opposer of slavery.
Protest is the safety-valve of every age and country, and every age and country furnish some examples of its salutary influence. The clarion blown by Luther, which overthrew the gigantic Papal power, has been needed in every generation since his time, and has been sounded by a succession of brave reformers, each performing a most important service to his age, and each execrated for it by those who were making shrines for the popular Diana. Its notes are now heard sounding the onset against slavery, and it is a matter of course that the supporters of slavery, in Church and State, should cry 'Infidel' against those who sound it.
There are few towns in New England where this sort of vague vituperation is not used by somebody against somebody else. There are few, therefore, that would not gain instruction as well as entertainment by bearing this lecture.�C. K. W.

LETTER FROM REV. SAMUEL J. MAY.
By the following letter, (which, though written for our private perusal, we take the liberty to print for the gratification of many others.) it will be seen that in the course of another week, we shall probably have the pleasure of announcing the arrival in this city, after a year's absence on his European tour, of our early friend, faithful and universally beloved coadjutor, Rev. SAMUEL J. MAY, of Syracuse, N.Y. He has done excellent service abroad, and will receive a cordial welcome home.
LONDON. Oct.5,1859.
MY VERY DEAR FRIEND:
I returned to this modem Babylon last Monday evening, and while eating my supper, the waiter brought me an envelope, containing a letter from yourself, another from George B. Emerson , and a third from my dear Joseph. I assure you, they gave a relish to my repast, which no sweets or spices could have done.
My absence from my country and home is now soon, I trust, to end; and I look towards the land of my birth and of my dearest relations and friends with a yearning heart. For 'my country, with all thy faults, I love thee still.' If we surpass all other nations in the iniquity of slaveholding, we excel them in several very important respects.
The tour I have taken has been full of entertainment and instruction�sometimes too intensely interesting to be promotive of the object for which I came abroad. Nevertheless. I have improved much; certainly I have gained flesh and ruddy looks.
My visit to Great Britain and Ireland has been altogether the most gratifying part of my tour, excepting only Rome and Switzerland. And the delight I have had here in meeting the 'true and faithful' of whom I had so often heard, has been to me a joy, I have found no where else. Now that he has gone, I especially rejoice that I had the privilege of seeing so much of Prof. Nichol as well as his admirable wife. If my cousin, Samuel May, Jr., received my long letter, mailed to him in Wales, on the 16th day of Sept., you have already had some account of my visits to anti-slavery friends up to that date. But my highest pleasures of the sort have bean enjoyed since then, in my visits to Richard D. Webb, James Haughton, Mrs. Edmundson, and other friends, in Ireland, and to Mary Estlin, Mary Carpenter, and a host of others in Bristol. As to R. D. Webb, he took complete possession of my heart. Indeed, he and I fell so in love with each other, that I do not think what we say the one of the other should be taken by others without large deductions'!
The interviews that I had with anti-slavery friends in Dublin and Bristol were exceedingly satisfactory, and I believe more beneficial to the cause than more public meetings would have been.
94 o'clock. Since I finished the previous page, I have been to dine with the Trustees of the Dr. Williams Library, 49 Red Cross street. Most of them were Unitarians�many of them Unitarian ministers. After dinner, they moved and passed a resolution welcoming me, and complimenting me for my anti-slavery labors. I addressed them half an hour the conduct of the American Church, our Unitarian section of it not excepted. They seemed much moved. Mr. Aspland invited me to lecture on Slavery in this chapel next Tuesday evening. Dr. Sadler invited me to preach in his chapel next Sunday morning. All were exceedingly cordial. One gentleman subscribed for the Anti-Slavery Standard.
There is a great work to be done in this country. I have several proposals to make when I see you, You may expect me about the 3d or 5th of November. Yours, with unabated affection,
SAMUEL J. MAY.
P. S. I am to lecture on Slavery next week, on Tuesday evening, in Mr. Aspland's chapel, and on Friday evening, in a large Methodist church. Miss Remond is really doing excellent service.

SALLIE HOLLEY'S LABORS IN MAINE. 
WEST GOULDSBORO', Oct. 19, 1859.
DEAR MR. GARRISON:
Already have your readers been informed that this untiring, earnest and devoted pleader for the slave has been laboring for several weeks in Maine. For the last month, she has visited the extreme eastern portion of our State, and for the first time there have the doctrines and principles of the American Anti-Slavery Society been declared. Testimony has also been given to the worth and efficiency of her labors here, but much more might be said, and still not half the story be told. I have heard her speak in, Gouldsborough, Sullivan, Winter Harbor, Hancock. Ellsworth, and twice in Cherry field, in all of which places the anti-slavery word has been spoken with a power and beauty that have touched more than one heart, and caused it to beat, for the first time, with sympathy for the slave.
In all these meetings, I have felt the mighty influence of the spirit of truth, as she has declared the 'whole counsel of God,' so gently, and yet so great. So great has been this influence, that I would that I could sit under her ministrations seven times more� yes, even 'seven times seven.' Those who have heard her but once or twice, cannot realize from what an extensive store-house of knowledge and culture she takes the ideas which so gain the admiration of their intellects and the affections of their hearts. It is a cause for rejoicing that so many in Maine have listened to her voice�that voice which pleads for the slave with an eloquence we might expect, where the soul whose deep feelings it utters is all alive with the love of God and humanity. And it is certainly a hopeful omen, that ministers, lawyers, members of the State Legislature and of congress, county officers, church members, and humble citizens in Maine, have all joined in welcoming her to their homes, and have given all necessary assistance in getting up her meetings.
All this seems to tell me that there is too deep and too strong an anti-slavery sentiment in Maine to content itself with working for any political party now existing, and occasionally giving aid and sympathy to an entertaining and interesting anti-slavery speaker, who is sent by a Society to whose funds it has previously contributed. If the sympathy which has just been manifested for the noble and true Sallie Holley, in her tour through eastern Maine, be any thing, it will show itself by practical fruits righteousness. If we could only judge the people by this, what a formidable array of names should we have a right to expect would turn up from away down east,' demanding that Maine shall be a free State! And if we do not see this next winter , shall we not be justified in concluding that all this sympathy which we claim to have for the anti-slavery cause and its laborers is pretension and sham?
It must be that some of the precious seed sown by Sallie Holley in Maine will ' fall upon good ground.' Washington and Hancock counties will speak in earnest tones, and demand that their soil shall be free. We cannot lose in a moment the impression made upon our hearts as we listened spell-bound to her who so vividly pictured before us the horrors of American slavery. If we do, may ' God have mercy upon us,' and help us, pretended Abolitionists of Maine, to wake up to a sense of our duty!
If we venerate so much an agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society, how much more ought we to venerate the truth which that Society through its agents proclaims, and help it to increase its power by giving it 'material aid'! May the professing anti-slavery men and women of eastern Maine, at least, show their 'faith by their works,' and bid defiance to, and sever all connection with, a Church or State, Union or Constitution, which is not on the side of God and humanity, and consequently does not demand the immediate and unconditional emancipation of the slave!

MISS HOLLEY'S SECOND VISIT IN ELLSWORTH, ME.
This bold, talented, educated, and truly eloquent Agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society delivered another lecture on her return from the Eastern frontier of the State, to a large and intelligent audience, on Monday evening, Oct. 17; holding the three-quarters, while she delineated the beautiful teachings of Jesus, and the reception he met from the church and priesthood, and showing the analogy between his mission and the similarity of the church of our day and that of Jesus time. He was branded as an infidel, a blasphemer, a devil, by the church of his time; so are the Abolitionists of our time.
The reformer in all ages has been sacrificed upon the altar of his cause, and why should the Abolitionists expect any thing different in their case? for they are engaged in as noble and sacred a cause as humanity ever witnessed.
In her tour East, she has been entertained, in almost every instance, if not all, by the best and most influential members of the Republican party, thereby shedding light in their ranks, which must sooner or later spring up and bear the fruit of freedom. She was entertained here by the chairman of Republican County Committee, which, as an index of the party here, shows that it is ahead of the church. The church is the greatest obstacle in the way of our movement; worse, much more so, than all things else put together. The Baptist minister, who heard her lecture, told me the next day that her denunciations against the church were too sweeping; that the church did not brand the Abolition movement as an infidel movement, but considered it eminently Christian; that the church was doing all she could in this cause. I asked him if the abolition cause was eminently Christian, why did you organize a 'Christian Anti-Slavery Society' in Worcester, the other day, when our Society is so much older, and ready to receive you? You virtually said, by organizing, that we were anti-Christian. Why did the priests in Boston, in the midst of your revival, pray God to put a hook in Theodore Parker's mouth? Simply because he did not believe right; not that he is wanting in good morals, sympathy, humanity, justice and truth. Said I, what did your brother from Boston last summer tell me?-that 'they were spewing out their filth and slime indiscriminately, and their meetings were Tammany Hall gatherings.' Said my friend Kent, who stood by listening, 'How many Anti-Slavery sermons have you preached since you came here? Who entertains the Anti-Slavery lecturers? To whom do they go? What was Henry C. Wright called, while here last spring, in the midst of your revival, but an infidel?' Thank God there is progress-laymen begin to feel that priests are nothing but men, and less.
But, to proceed. Miss Holley goes next to Surry, Bluehill, Sedgwick, Orland and Bucksport, in this county, and probably some other towns, preparing the way for Abolition sentiments. She tells me that her health is better than heretofore, and that she has met with the kindest reception all through the State. She has stirred up our pure minds to such an extent, that we shall send for Henry C. Wright to visit us immediately, and assist us to dedicate two new meeting-houses which have been built the last season, one Baptist and the other Methodist. I apprehend that neither will care to have him come, but we have concluded that he is the man, next in turn. Then some time in the winter, if he can be obtained, we will have Wendell Phillips, to deliver one or two of his Lyceum lectures.
Thus we progress here as well as in other places. Even in old Virginia, the Boston Journal brings us the news that there is now an insurrection. This is but the fruit of slavery, though the index of progress. But Freedom will have to march over the dead bodies of many before her banner can float over a redeemed people.

THE REV. J. W. LOGUEN. AS A SLAVE AND AS A FREEMAN. A Narrative of Real Life. Syracuse, N. Y. 1859.
This is a volume of 444 duodecimo pages, every page of which is replete with interest, beginning with Loguen's parentage, infancy and childhood, and tracing him from the Southern prison through the wilderness to Canada, and back to the United States again, 'to fight the enemy all through the anti-slavery war' to the end of the famous 'Jerry Rescue,' giving the particulars of that Rescue, with the names of the persons engaged in it, on the one side and on the other. For the take of the millions still bound in chains at the South, as well as for his own pecuniary benefit, we hope this narrative will find many purchasers. Hereafter, as we can find space, we shall give our readers ' a taste of its quality,' by copious quotations.
Mr. Loguen has, for several years past, has the principal charge of the Underground Railroad at Syracuse, and is much respected. He is physically and mentally a very remarkable man, and one of the most effective platform speakers in the country. The portrait accompanying this volume does him no justice.

INTERESTING MEETING.
On Monday evening, the 24th inst., a large meeting (mostly of colored citizens) was held at the Bethel Church, West Centre street, Rev. Mr. Young presiding. The announced purpose of the meeting was to hear addresses from various individuals on Slavery and Temperance; but as freedom of speech was the order accepted for the evening, a wide range of thought was expressed, and a more than incidental reference made to the recent scene at Harper's Ferry. Those who indulged in a desponding mood in view of new persecutions anticipated were in a decided minority. The others, with a philosophic eye discovered an early future for a settlement of the ever-vexing question of slavery.
Among the speakers were the venerable Austin Steward and his daughter, who have been holding anti-slavery meetings in this vicinity; Mrs. Mary Shadd Cary, editor of the Provincial Freeman, Chatham, Canada West; William F. Johnson, the eloquent blind lecturer of Ithaca, N. Y.; Rev. J. B. Smith, Rev. J. W. Lewis, Dr. John S. Rock, Lysander Spooner, Esq., and Wm. C. Nell. Rev. J. S. Martin and Rev. Wm. Jackson were also present and lateness of the hour. Seldom has it happened that, by seeming chance, without preconcerted arrangement, such an array of speakers has been found, and all warmed up with such emotions as found utterance on this occasion.
At eleven o'clock the meeting adjourned, anticipating another gathering next Monday evening.
Boston, Oct. 25, 1859. W. C. N.
The Anti-Slavery Convention at Cummington is postponed till Now. 19th and 20th. [See notice.]-we are happy to announce Mrs. FRANCES D. GAGE among the speakers at the meeting of the Essex Co. A. S. Society at Manchester, on Sunday next.

FURTHER PARTICULARS OF THE ATTEMPTED INSURRECTION IN VIRGINIA.
HARPER'S FERRY, Wednesday, Oct. 19-P. M.- The killed and wounded in yesterday's conflict is as follows-Killed, six citizens and fifteen insurgents: wounded, three insurgents prisoners five.
The prisoners have beer, committed to Charlestown Jail, to await the action of the Grand Jury. They will be indicted and tried in a few days. The question of jurisdiction has been settled in this way:- The local authorities are to try the prisoners for murder, and meanwhile the United States authorities are to proceed on the charge of treason. Gov. Wise said to U. S. District Attorney Ould that he has no objection to the general government proceeding against the prisoners, that is, what will be left of them by the time the Virginia authorities have done with them. 
Brown is better and has made a fuller statement, in which he says he rented the farm from Dr. Kennedy six months since, and the rent is paid till next March; he never had over twenty-two men at the farm at one time, that belonged to the organization, but he had good reason to expect reinforcements from Maryland, Kentucky, North and South Carolina, and Canada; he had arms sufficient for fifteen hundred men; he had two hundred revolvers, two hundred Sharpe's rifles, and a thousand spears; he left them at the farm; he had abundance of powder and other ammunition; he brought all the arms, from time to time, from Connecticut and other eastern points, to Ghambersburgh, pennsylvania; they were directed to J. Smith k Sons, Kennedy Farm, his assumed name. They were packed in double boxes so as to deceive the parties who handled them on their way to the farm. He says he made one mistake in either not detaining the train on Sunday night, or permitting it to go on unmolested. This mistake, he seemed to infer, exposed his doings too soon, and prevented his reinforcements from coming. 
The names of all the parties on Sunday night, except three white men, whom he admits he sent away on an errand, are as follows, with their proper titles under the Provisional Government:- 

WHITES. 
Officers.-Gen. John Brown, Commander-in-Chief, wounded, but will recover; Capt. Oliver Brown, dead; Capt. Watson Brown, dead; Capt. Aaron C. Stevens, of Connecticut, wounded badly-he has three balls and cannot possibly recover. Lieut. Edwin Coppie, of Iowa, unhurt; Lieut. Albert Hazlett, of Pennsylvania, dead; Lieut. Wm. Leman, of Maine, dead; Capt. John E. Cook, of Connecticut, escaped. 
Privates-Stewart Taylor, of Canada, dead; Charles P. Tidd, of Maine, dead; Wm. Thompson, of New York, dead; Adolph Thompson, of New York, dead; Capt. John King, of Ohio, raised in Virginia, dead; Lieut. Jeremiah Anderson, of Indiana, dead.
With the three whites previously tent off, these make a total of seventeen whites.

NEGROES.
Dangerfield, newly of Ohio, raised in Virginia, dead; Emperor, of New York, raised in South Carolina, not wounded, but a prisoner. The latter was elected a member of the Provisional Government some time since. Lewis Leary, of Ohio, raised in Virginia, dead. Copeland, of Ohio, rained in Virginia, not wounded, a prisoner at Charlestown. 
Gen. Brown has nine wounds, but none fatal. 
Bushels of letters have been discovered from all parts of the country. One from Gerrit Smith informs Brown of money being deposited in a bank in New York to the credit of J. Smith & Sons. It appears to be one of many, informing him from time to time as money was received. 

THE FRAME-WORK OF THE PROPOSED REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT.
BALTIMORE, Oct. 19.-The following documents, found among Brown's papers, were endorsed: 'Provisional Constitution and Ordinance for the People of the United States:

PREAMBLE. 
Whereas, Slavery throughout its entire existence in the United States is none other than the most barbarous, unprovoked and unjustifiable war of one portion of its citizens against another portion, the only conditions of which are perpetual imprisonment and hopeless servitude, or absolute extermination, in utter, disregard and violation of those eternal and self-evident truths set forth in our Declaration of Independence; 
Therefore, we, the citizens of the United States, and the oppressed people, who, by a recent decision of the Supreme Court, are declared to have no rights which the white man is bound to respect; together with all the other people degraded by the laws thereof,-do, for the time being, ordain and establish for ourselves the following Provisional Constitution and Ordinance, the better to protect our people, property, lives and liberties, and to govern our actions.

BALTIMORE, Oct. 20.-Gerrit Smith's letter of the most importance is as follows:- 
PETERBORO', June 4, 1859. 
CAPT. JOHN BROWN: 
MY DEAR FRIEND,-I wrote yon a week ago, directing my letter to the care of Mr. Kearney. He replied, informing me that he had forwarded it to Washington, but as Mr. Morton received, last evening, a letter from Mr. Sanborn, saying your address would be your son's home, viz., West Andover, I therefore write you without delay, and direct your letter to my son. I have done what I could thus far for Kansas, and what I could to keep you at your Kansas work. Losses by endorsement and otherwise have brought me under heavy embarrassment the last two years, but I must nevertheless continue to do in order to keep you at your Kansas work. I send you herewith my draft for two hundred dollars. Let me hear from you on the receipt of this letter. You live in our hearts, and our prayer to God is that you may have strength to continue in your Kansas work. My wife joins me in affectionate regard to you, dear John, whom we both hold in very high esteem. 
I suppose you put the Whitman note into Mr. Kearney's hands. It will be a great shame if Mr. Whitman does not pay it. 
What a noble man is Mr. Kearney! How liberally he has contributed to keep you in your Kansas work! 
Your friend, GERRIT SMITH. 
A PRESS IN DANGER.-So great was the excitement in Washington, growing out of tie Harper's Ferry affair, that on Tuesday, says a correspondent of the Baltimore Sun, ' one of the publishers of the National Era (an anti-slavery paper,) made application at the Central Guard House, asserting that threats had been made to destroy their property, and they had reason to fear that an attack would be made in the course of the night. Lieut. McHenry assured him that a watch would be preserved over the property, though he had we reason himself to apprehend such an attempt. The chief of police arriving, instructed the guards to pay attention, in that direction, but there was no indication of any such movement through the night.
The Washington States, the Douglas organ, makes the following effort to raise a mob for the destruction of the Era and Republic offices:- 
'That there are desperate Abolitionists in this community, prepared to apply the match to the Union, cannot be reasonably doubted. 
'Have the National Era and Republic any subscribers in this city? if so, such are in hostile array to its durable well-being.
'We suspect that the bloody scheme of Harper's Ferry had its siders and abettors in Washington. We shall not be surprised if it is a concentrating point for the concocting of desperate Black Republican schemes.' 
THE FRIGHT EXTENDING. The Adjutant General of Pennsylvania has taken away the arms of a volunteer company of colored men in Philadelphia, illegible sequence of the insurrection in Virginia. Perhaps our legislature will be terrified also, and re-consider their action in rotation to the-Bins We wonder how people have been able to live with one whole company of negro soldiers in Philadelphia, illegible 660.000 illegible. We hope the illegible Guard and the illegible this city will be illegible alert. We have two colored barbers illegible it would bean awful thing if they illegible razors on the throats of all the people illegible Newburyport Herald.

TRIAL OF BROWN. 
CHARLESTOWN, Va. Oct. 29. Eight magistrates are on the bench, Colonel Davenport presiding justice.
At half-past 10, the prisoners were brought into Court, under a guard of eighty armen men. Guards were stationed around the Court-House, and bayonets are glistening on all sides. 
Charles B. Hunting and Andrew Hunter act for the prosecution. 
Brown and Coppie were brought into Court, manacled together. Brown appeared weak, haggard, and eyes swollen from the effects of the wound in his head. Coppie is uninjured. Stevens also looked haggard and depressed. 
The prisoners were severally charged with treason and murder. The Court asked if the prisoners had counsel, when Brown spoke as follows:- 
'I did not ask for any quarter at the time I was taken; I did not ask to have my life spared. The Governor of the State of Virginia tendered me assurances that I should have a fair trial, but under no circumstances whatever will I be able to have a fair trial. If you seek my blood, you can have it at any moment, without this mockery of a trial. I have had no counsel. I have not been able to advise with any one. I know nothing about the feelings of my fellow-prisoners, and am utterly unable to attend in any way to my own defence. My memory don't serve me-my health is insufficient, although improving. There are mitigating circumstances that I would urge in our favor, if a fair trial is to be had; but if we are to be forced, with a mere form, to trial for execution, you might spare yourself that trouble. I am ready for my fate. I beg for no mockery of a trial-no insult; nothing but that which conscience gives or cowardice drives you to practise. 
I ask again to be excused from the mockery of a trial. I do not even know what the special design of this examination is; I do not know what is to be the benefit of it to the Commonwealth. I have now little further to ask other than that I may not be foolishly insulted, only as cowardly barbarians insult those who fall into their power.' 
At the conclusion of Brown's remarks, the Court assigned Charles J. Faulkner and Lawson Botts as counsel for the prisoner. The first-named gentleman, after a brief consultation with Brown and others, addressed the Court, stating that he could not, under any circumstances, enter upon the defence of the prisoners on so short a notice. It would he but a mockery of justice. 
Mr. Botts said he did not feel it to be his duty to decline the appointment of the Court. He was prepared to do his best to defend the prisoners, and he hoped the Court would assign some experienced assistant, in case Mr. Faulkner persisted in his declination. 
Mr. Harding addressed Brown, and asked him if he was willing to accept Messrs. Faulkner and Botts as his counsel. 
Mr. Brown replied: 'I wish to say that I have sent for counsel. I did apply, through the advice of some persons here, to some persons, whose names I do not now recollect, to act as counsel for me, and I have sent for other counsel, who have had no possible chance to see me. I wish for counsel, if I am to have a trial; but, if I am to have nothing but the mocker; of a trial, as I said, I do not care any thing about counsel. It is unnecessary to trouble any gentleman with that duty.' 
Mr. Harding-You are to have a fair trial.
Mr. Brown-There are certain men, I think Mr. Botts was one of them, who declined acting as counsel; but I am not positive about it. I cannot remember whether he was one, because I have heard so many names. I am a stranger here. I do not know the disposition or character of the gentlemen named. I have applied for counsel of my own, and doubtless could have them, if I am not, as I said before, to be hurried to execution before they can reach me; but, if that is the disposition that is to be made of me, all this trouble and expense can be saved.
Mr. Harding-The question is, do you desire the aid of Messrs. Faulkner and Botts as your counsel? Please to answer-Yes or No.
Mr. Brown-I cannot regard this as an examination under any circumstances. I would prefer that they should exercise their own pleasure. I feel as if it was a matter of very little account to me. If they had designed to assist me as counsel, I should have wanted an opportunity to consult them at my leisure.
Mr. Harding-Are yon willing these gentlemen should act as your counsel?
Stevens-I am willing that gentleman should (pointing to Mr. Botts.)
Mr. Harding-Do you object to Mr. Faulkner?
Stevens-No, I am willing to take both.
Mr. Harding addressed each of the other prisoners separately, and each stated his willingness to be de-ended by the counsel named.
The Court issued a peremptory order that the press would not publish detailed testimony, as it would ender the getting of a Jury before the Circuit Court impossible The preliminary examination being concluded, the Court remanded the prisoners for trial before the Circuit Court.
The examination to-day was merely to see whither he charges are of sufficient importance to go before he Grand Jury. To-morrow the Jury will report he bill, and the case will then be immediately called or trial. There is an evident intention to hurry the trial through and execute the prisoners as soon as possible, fearing an attempt to rescue them. In the case of servile insurrection, thirty days are not required between conviction and execution, as in other capital convictions. The principal witnesses to-day gave precisely the same testimony in detail as was published in their statement.
Beyond a doubt the trial will commence to-morrow morning, although much difficulty is anticipated in obtaining a jury. Brown's objection in refusing the aid of counsel is, that if he has counsel, he will not be allowed to speak himself, and southern counsel will not be willing to express his views.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25.-A letter from U. S. Sensor Mason, after due investigation at Harper's Ferry, says there was no insurrection in any form whatsoever on the part of the inhabitants of that town or vicinity. The fact is undoubted that not a man, black or white, joined the invaders after they came into Virginia, or gave them aid or assistance in any form.
So far as can be discovered, not one of the nineteen escaped. Not a slave escaped, or attempted to escape, during the tumult. Of the-few carried off by Cook cross the river, all escaped from him and came safely back but one, who, it appears, was drowned while crossing the river, homeward bound.
CHAMBERSBURG, PA., 26th.-Cook, the fillibuster insurrectionist, was arrested last night, and committed to await a requisition from the Governor of Virginia. He was arrested at Montallo, 14 miles from his place. His printed commission, signed by Brown, was found on his person. He was fully armed, and made a desperate resistance. He was almost starved, and came from the mountain into the settlement to obtain provisions. He acknowledged having three companions on the mountain. Parties have gone in pursuit them. 
RICHMOND, VA. 26th.-Gov. Wise having learned by telegraph to-day of the arrest of Cook, at Chambersburg, immediately sent on a requisition for him to the Executive of Pennsylvania.
CHARLESTOWN, 26th.-Brown, the insurrectionist, makes no confession. He says he has full confidence God will rescue him; he has many times been n as great a peril as now, but God always befriended him. He fears nothing.

SOUTH NATICK, Oct. 17, 1859. 
Our village church was nearly full Sunday evening last, to enjoy the pulpit services of Mrs. Caroline H. Jail, of Boston. She conducted all the exercises or he desk with an ability and persuasiveness and acceptance which her well known gifts impart to her.
The best way to settle all doubts about woman's sphere as a preacher or at the altar, is to give her a hearing. If she succeeds as Mrs. Dall does, prejudices are removed, which no theorizing nor arguing can reach. I thank God for her winning voice, in the pulpit and on the platform. WM. G. B.che

Is there any Virtue in 
MRS. S. A. ALLEN'S 
WORLD'S 
HAIR RESTORER?
READ THE FOLLOWING, AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF. 
To THE ED'S OF EVANGRLIST:-'My age is sixty. One year age, my hair was very gray, and had been gradually falling, until, on the crown, it had become quite thin. About the 1st of March, at the present year. I commenced using Mrs. S. A. Allen's ' Rasterer,' No. 1, according to the directions, and have continued to apply a slight dressing of the same once in three or four weeks on retiring to bed. My hair is now almost restored to its original color, and the hue appears to be permanent. I AM SATISFIED THAT THE PREPARATION IS NOTHING LIKE A DYE, BUT OPERATES UPON THE SECRETIONS. My hair ceases to mil, which is certainly am advantage to one who was in danger of becoming bald.' Rev. M. THACHER.
Bridgewater, Oneida Co., N. Y., Nov. 22, 1855. 
President J. L EATON, LL. D., Union University, Murfreesboro', Tennessee.
'MADAM-I would state, that some time last spring I found MY HAIR FALLING OFF. I concluded to purchase a bottle of 'Mrs. S. A. Allen's World's Restorer,' &c., and give it a trial. I commenced using it, but very irregularly; but notwithstanding this irregularity, I found that its influence was distinctly visible, THE FALLING OFF OF HAIR CEASED, and my locks, which before were quite a GRAY, WERE CHANGED TO BLACK. I do not consider that I have given it a fair trial, but, from what I have seen of its effects in my own case, I have reason to believe that it is capable of accomplishing what it purports to do, viz., PREVENT THE HAIR FROM FALLING OFF, and to RESTORE GRAY LOCKS TO THEIR ORIGINAL COLOR.'
Mrs. D. W. CLARK, wife of Rev. D. W. CLARK, Editor ' Ladies' Repository,1 Cincinnati, Ohio. 
'I have been using Mrs. S. A. Allen's Zylobalsamum with much satisfaction in dressing my own sad children's hair. After trying various articles manufactured for the hair, I feel no hesitation in recommending yours as the best I have ever used. It fives the hair a soft, glossy appearance, and retains it in any position desired.'
Rev. JOHN E. ROBIE, Editor ' Christian Advocate,' Buffalo, N. Y. 
'Your Hair Restorer and Zylobalsamum is the best I have ever known. It has restored my hair to its natural color,' &c. 
Rev. E. R. FAIRCHILD. D. D., Cor. Sec. American and Foreign Christian Union, N. Y. City.
'Mrs. S. A. Allan's Hair Restorer and Zylobasamum have been used in my family with beneficial effects; and I take pleasure in recommending them set such as have occasion to use such preparations.'
Rev. A. WEBSTER, Editor ' Christian Era,' Baton, Miss. ' Having used numerous specifics to little purpose, I discarded all, believing them to be of no valve. So I regarded your World's Hair Restorer and Zylobalsamum, yet personal friends prevailed on me to use it. I have done so for several months past with good effect and entire satisfaction. I am nose neither bald nor gray, my hair was dry and brittle, but has regained the softness of my earlier yean.' 
Rev. H. V. DEGEN, Ed. 'Guide to Holiness,' Boston.
'Mrs. S. A. Allen's World's Hair Restorer, found among our other advertisements, we insert from actual experiment. That it promotes the growth of the hair where baldness had commenced, we have now the evidence of our own eyes. We can testify to its good effects.'
Rev. S. B. MORLEY, Pastor Congregational Church, Attleboro', Mass. 
'I have used Mrs. S. A. Allen's Word's Hair Restorer and Zylobalsamum. The effect of the Hair Restorer has been to change the ' crown of glory' which belongs to old men to the original hue of youth. This was done by a single bottle used according to directions. Others of my acquaintance have need it with the same effect. The Zylobalsamum I regard as an invaluable dressing for the hair.'
Rev. DANIEL T. WOOD, Middletown, Orange Co., N. Y.
'My hair has greatly thickened upon my head, and put on a very lively, healthy appearance. The same is true of my daughter; HE HAIR HAD BECOME, AND CAME OUT CONSTANTLY, UNTIL WE THOUGHT THE HEAD
WOULD BE ALMOST BARS; HER HAIR HAS HANDSOMELY THICKENED UP. AND ALSO HAS A HEALTHY APPEARANCE. We are thankful to you, and feel that we hare full value of our money.'
GREAT BRITAIN.
Rev. W. B. THORNELOE, Present, Lancashire, England.
'Your Hair Restorer is a pet fact marvel. After having used it for six weeks, my extremely gray hair was restored to its natural color,-not the wig-like appearance produced by dyes, but to its own natural color, which satisfies my mind that it is not a dye. I can strongly recommend it, and shall feet happy in answering the queries of any you may refer to me.'
[The above clergyman is well known throughout Great Britain, and to many in the United States.]

HAYTI.
Rev. Mrs. E. S. ANDRUS, (many years Missionary to Hayti,) Martinsburgh, N. Y. 
In consequence of her long rasidence in aforenamed island, her hair and scalp were in a very unhealthy condition. After trying various articles without success, and eventually using Mrs. S. A. Allan's she writes to the ' American Baptist.'-'I have derived much benefit from the use of Mrs. S. A. Allan's World's Hair Restorer and Zylobalsamum; I have tried many other remedies for my hair, but never any thing that so materially and permanently benefitted me as those of Mrs. S. A. Allen.'
Rev. R. H. POLLOCK, Ed. ' Presbyterian Witness,' Cincinnati, Ohio.
'It is our settled policy to advertise nothing till we know it is what it purports to be. Having opportunity, and being satisfied of the merits of Mrs. S. A. Allen's Hair Restorer and Zylobasamum, I would be pleased to insert advertisement,' &c.
Rev. J. A. H. CORNELL, Corres. Sec. Board of Education R. D. Church, 337 Broadway, N. Y., and New Baltimore, Greene county, N. Y.
'Some time since, I procured a bottle of year World's Hair Restorer, &c., for the use of a relative; and I am happy to say, that it prevented the falling of the hair, and restored it from being gray to its original glossy and beautiful black.'
Rev. JAS. McFARLANE B, Pastor Prot. Dutch Church, Esopus, Ulster county, N. Y. 
"I have no hesitation in certifying that Mrs. S. A. Allen's World's Hair Restorer and Zylobalsamum have produced all the effects described in her advertisement, in restoring the color and increasing the growth of the hair; and I would cheerfully recommend it to those whose hair may either begin to ami in color or decrease in luxuriance.' 
Rev. J. WEST, 6 Washington Place, (Pacific street) Brooklyn. 
'I am happy to bear testimony to the value and efficacy of this preparation of Mrs. Allen's, in the most literal sense, and also thankfully acknowledge the use of it in curing my baldness and grayness.'
Rev. B. C. SMITH. Prettsbury, N. Y. 
'I was really surprised to find my gray hair soon turned as black as when I was a young man.' 
Rev. M. C. KLING, Lewistown, Pennsylvania.
'It has stopped the falling off of my hair, and caused a new growth, although I did not attend to it as your directions require.'
Rev. AMOS BLANCHARD, Meriden, N. H.
'We think very highly of your preparations, and have no doubt, if you had an agent is this visinity, a large quantity might be disposed of.' 
We think that if these fail to consines, nothing less than a trial will. Some few declares try to sell artisley on which they make more profit than on these; always INSIST on having these.
These are the only preparations experted in any quantity to Europe. 
We aspire to have the best, not the lowest priced, One bottle of the Restorer will last a year; $1 50 a bottle. Balsam, 871/2 cents per bottle.
Address all letters for information, &c., to 'MES. A. Allen's World's Hair Restorer Depot, No. illegible Broome street, New York.' The Gennine has 'Mrs. S. A. Allen,' signed in Red Ink to outside wrappe illegible and in Black Ink to directins posted on bottles-none other is genuine.

From the New York Evening Post. 
THE TWO HARVESTS.
BY M. G. MACDONALD.
The wheat stands thick on many a northern field,
On miles of prairie gleams the abundant maize;
And for the stores that farm and orchard yield,
We pay to God our dues of thanks and praise.
We cow the seed, that straightway seems to sleep;
Then comes the sun, the frost, the wind, the rain;
And when the appointed season comes, we reap
With thankful hearts the increase of our grain.
We plant, we waterman can do no more;
The change begins from where our labors end;
Our toil would leave us as we were before,
Save for the aid of God, who is our friend.
There's not the smallest blade of grass or corn
Would bloom or blossom for our best endeavor;
Without our help or knowledge they are! born,
And so it shall be on this earth forever.
The ways of God, we see but where they lead;
We cannot trace the working of his plan;
And as he rears the flowers that dress the mead,
So deals he with his noblest creature, man.
We know the bud, and have not seen the flower,
And all our growth we can but dimly see;
We trust as to his guiding love and power,
Secure in hope, though scant our knowledge be.
Faith, therefore, shall our restlessness confine,
Patience shall bear the storms that round us roll;
In heaven we yet shall learn God's full design,
And thank him for the harvest of the soul.

DOGGEREL.
 I.
THE UNDER DOG IN THE FIGHT.
BY DAVID BARKER.
I know that the world, that the great big world,
From the peasant up to the king,
Has a different tale from the tale I tell.
And a different song to sing.
But for meand I care not a single fig
If they say I am wrong or right
I shall always go in for the weaker dog,
For the under dog in the fight.
I know that the world, that the great big world,
Will never for a moment stop
To see which dog may be in the fault,
But will shout for the dog on top.
But for me, I never shall pause to ask
Which dog may be in the right,
For my heart will beat, while it beats at all,
For the under dog in the fight.
Perchance what I've said I had better not said,
Or 'twere better I had said it incog,
But with heart and with glass filled chock to the
 brim,
Here's a health to the bottom dog!
 II.
THE UPPER DOG IN THE FIGHT.
BY JOHN SMITH.
The world likes success, and the mighty great world
The peasant kicks, and caresses the king;
I don't care a dime what other men say,
This is the song to sing.
The world gives applause to the man who succeeds,
And awards him honor and place;
So let 's fill to the brim, and shout with strong lungs,
To the rider that wins in the race.
The world hates the fool, the snivelling fool,
Who soars, but fails in his flight;
And, talk as we please, we all hurrah
For the uppermost dog in the fight.
What right has a dog, the great world says,
To allow himself under at all?
He disgraces his race, and deserves to be kicked,
To permit himself meanly to fall.
It might appease the great world, the mighty great 
 world.
And keep everything well balanced right,
Were there no upper dog, and no under dog,
Could both equal be in the fight.
But for me, I will shout with the strength of my 
lungs.
Nor for cavilling fools will I stop,
For the dog of success, that glorious dog,
Who looks sharp to keep upon top.
 III.
THE OUTSIDE DOG IN THE FIGHT.
BY JOHN JONES.
You may prate of your upper and bottom dog,
And blow an alarming sight,
But, as I've always found, the safest dog
Is the outside dog in the fight.
He never desires to be counted in,
Thus showing an instinct bright;
He saves his grinders for polishing bones,
Does the outside dog in the fight.
Mr. Bulldog may try, as long as he likes,
To damage his foeman's sight,
But the pleasant position of looking on
Has the outside dog in the fight.
Utterly heedless If in the strife
The might prevail, or the right;
The appetite's good, and tranquil the life
Of the outside dog in the fight.
When danger threatens, the rapid way
That he runs is refreshing quite.
And simply evinces the sound good sense
Of the outside dog in the fight.
Then here's to his healthy and happy days,
Luck send him abundance of prog,
And drink to the hero of private life,
A health to the outside dog!
 IV.
THE DOG THAT GOES IN FOR THE RIGHT.
BY REV. J. L. HATCH.
Now that your upper and bottom dog,
And you outside dog in the fight,
Have each had his post, let me be heard
For the dog that goes, in for the right.
When a little dog by a big one is wronged,
He goes inwith all his might
For the little dog! or lose or win,
Does the dog that goes in for the right.
He may, for a time, be a bottom dog.
But he knows, by an instinct bright.
That the dog that will come out a-top in the end,
Is the dog that goes in for the right.
He loves his ease, and he loves his bone,
But he's not so selfish, quite,
As to care for an other dog but himself!
Not the dog that goes in for right.
He will die, sometime, and then, you must know,
Having fought while he lived a good fight.
He will go, without fail, where the good dogs go,
Will the dog that goes in for the right.
So here's a bumper, with health and success,
To the dog that's my heart's delight,
The noble dog the generous dog
The dog that goes in for the right.
Meeting boldly every storm,
We would seek that world's reform.

THE LIBERATOR
LETTER FROM LYDIA MARIA CHILD.
The following admirable letter, addressed to a meeting of the Friends of Human Progress, recently held at Ellenville, N. Y. will richly repay a careful t perusal.
WAYLAND, August 26,1859.
FRIENDS OF HUMAN PROGRESS:
Your aims as expressed in your circular, and in your last report, which you had the kindness to send me, receive my hearty concurrence; and if you seek , to advance them with candor and courtesy toward all, without the slightest shade of compromise with existing evils or errors, I wish you great success. With the thoughtfulness of increasing years, I find myself , more and more prone to place small value on creeds and forms, not because I have no respect for religion, but because I respect all religions. Your circular declares truly, that the religious sentiment is 'the leading element' in man's nature. The forms it takes are seeds of precious growth, and germs of the future; therefore the forms, as well as the sentiments they embody, are among the most important agencies in the progress of the human race. They express what man is, or has been, and they also do a mighty 'work in forming what he will do, either for good or evil In view of this, it is the duty of a wise reformer to challenge present forms of creed or worship, and ascertain whether they be living or dead, in their action on his own soul. If they are vital realities to him, he ought to cherish them as among the best gifts of God. But if he finds them cold, stiff corpses, or merely galvanized with spasmodic life, he should demand that the battery be applied to more useful purposes, and give the dead reverent burial.
All men do not perceive when spiritual harvest-fields have become mere stubble. Because their forefathers found nourishment there, they, by mere force of habit, continue to bestow a traditional value on the dry remains, while they completely ignore the harvests that are forming anew, from the scattered grains their stubble once contained. Some, who are conscious of small nutrition in their spiritual provender, are, for personal considerations, timid about calling it stubble, as long as a majority of their neighbors consider it corn; others are conscientiously afraid of doing injury to the cause of religion. They have no faith that God will provide future harvests, and they fear men will have nothing to feed upon, if they reject the husks left from former years. Such anxieties arise from narrow views of God's government. Truth can never be lost by successive changes of growth; on the contrary, its seeds multiply in every new field that is sown. Forms, whether manifested in the words of a creed or in modes of worship, are mere bodies, but truth is a spirit. It may be said as truly as of the human form, ' Soul never dies; matter flies off, and lives elsewhere.' In some epochs of the world's history, forms are adapted to the spiritual wants of the community, and express its state; and so long as this continues, they are alive. At other epochs, society has outgrown its forms, and they stand empty, but venerable to the imagination, like stately abbeys, whence the voice of prayer and psalm once ascended, but now standing silent and crumbling in the solemn moonlight.
In such an epoch as this last we are now living. I do not agree with those who think the world is less religious than it was. It is only less superstitious. There never was so much truth, and certainly it was never so widely disseminated. There never were such earnest efforts to regulate human relations according to the principles of justice and humanity. Do not those who mourn over the decay of religion mistake concerning what religion really is? It is obvious enough that the world is losing childhood's great capacity for belief; but surely the matured wisdom and conscientious kindness of manhood is a better endowment. The forms that grew out of man's inner life in various stages of his social development have been continually changing; but by influences so imperceptible at the time, that history, without recording the passing footprints, merely shows the great distance attained at long intervals; as physicians tell us that every particle of our bodies becomes changed in the course of seven years though we take no note of the gradual process, and only perceive that we are growing old.
The spiritual revolutions that are always going on, whether we take note of them or not, are very strikingly marked in the history of the priesthood. Originally, they were the sole depositories of all sorts of knowledge, and were to a considerable degree practically useful in natural and political science, so far as sciences were then understood. They were the doctors, the lawyers, the chemists and astronomers of their time. If people had fits, they went to the priest for remedies, which he gave them in the form of medicines, mineral or vegetable, accompanied by a form of consecrated words; for the ancient belief that evil spirits caused diseases by taking possession of human bodies, and that they could be expelled by holy words, of which they stood in fear, connected the science of medicine closely with religion, and united the physician and the priest in the same person. Ages passed before a separation took place between the two, and in the least enlightened parts of the world it is not yet accomplished. But in Europe and America, it is difficult to imagine two classes further apart, spiritually, than physicians and the clergy. Astronomy also passed into the hands of a class of men separate from the priesthood. They sentenced Galileo to the Inquisition for saying the earth moved round the sun, when Joshua's miracle plainly proved that the sun moved round the earth. But they tried in vain to chain the emancipated science. Though they refused to look through Galileo's telescope, for fear of seeing things contrary to Scripture, the telescope carried the day against Joshua. In our own time, geology has been arraigned before the first chapter of Genesis, in a similar way by the clergy; hut, fortunately, the power no longer exists to sentence men of science to the Inquisition. Small would have been the progress of any of the sciences, if they had been compelled to remain hitched to the car of theology. They have passed out among the people, and go freely whithersoever the laws of the universe lead them; and now, if there is variance between the statements of theelogy and of science, the labor is put upon theology to reconcile herself with science as best she can.
In early ages, the moral instruction of the people formed no part of the priestly mission. The Jews, like other ancient people, slew rams and goats, and offered a portion to their God, with a form of consecrated words. But there appears to have been no public instruction till Ezra established synagogues; and even then, the teachings seem to have been confined to explanations of prophecies and expoundings of Mosaic and Traditional laws, for the regulation of external affairs. According to the record, Jesus conformed to the usages of the established church of his country; but at the same time, he showed unto men a more excellent way. He told the people that a despised Samaritan, whom pious Jews regarded as an infidel, was more pleasing in the sight of the heavenly Father, by reason of his human deeds, than priests and Levites who wore the law of God written upon their foreheads, not upon their hearts. He taught them that worship might be acceptably performed elsewhere than in the temple, and by the agency of priasts; that the world was God's temple, and the holy of holies, where he especially manifested his presence, was a child-like heart. He instructed the populace from the hill-side and the fisherman's boat. He did not weary their patience by expounding old scriptures concerning the support of Levites, or tithes to the priests. The theme of his teaching was trust in God, and good will toward men.
As soon as <illegible> becomes an established
<c03>
church, with an established priesthood, the old habits of holy places and prescribed rituals superseded the simple worship of the apostles. The mission of the Roman Catholic clergy was mainly to go through a series of genuflexions and repetitions of words arranged for each day and each occasion, like the rotation of the water wheel on which the devout Buddhist lays his prayers to revolve before God. There were good men among them, holy men; but as a body hey were formalists, as all established priesthoods necessarily must become. Such instruction as the populace received was mainly through the agency of pictures and images. These were better than nothing in those dark times, when men had no books to read, and did not know the alphabet; when the Bible existed in only a few manuscript copies, written in unknown tongues, and possessed by priests only. A feeling of tenderness was awakened in the erude souls of ignorant peasants, by pictures of Jesus blessing little children, and some degree of refining influence was imparted to their coarse ideas of woman by representations of the holy 'mother.' They heard no sermons upon immortality, but in the church they saw pictures of the opening heaven, with thronging angels and ascending saints; and the yellow light from richly stained windows veiled the scene with golden glory, that to their childish imagination made it seem like a revelation of itself. Thus mourning hearts went away comforted by what was in reality a fabulous legend, embellished by the painter's handicraft. Some good was effected, in that way, as children too young to read words, receive some ideas from pictured objects. But the misfortune is, that the peasantry in Catholic countries receive very little instruction in any other form, even to the present day. It is the policy of the priesthood to perpetuate ignorance, for they know very well that books are even more dangerous than telescopes.
With the introduction of Protestantism, sermons became a prominent part of public worship; but they mainly consisted of abstruse theological doctrines, beyond the reach of reason, and appealing to Scripture authority for proof. The very basis of Protestantism was, that men had a right to exercise their reason in the investigation of sacred subjects, and the result was, that the sense of the Scriptures turned every way according to the spiritual state of the reader. Hence endless disputes about the Trinity, predestination, &c. There was a good deal of moral instruction conveyed in sermons, and it was a vast improvement:: upon the old system; but theology greatly preponderated over morality; and I think no candid and reflecting person can deny that theological doctrines, both in the Catholic and the Protestant churches, have worked and are working immense moral mischief. How can people be expected to be better than the God they believe in?and what horrible ideas of God are presented in many of the churches! What an impression is, for instance, conveyed to the mind by the line, ' The Lord in vengeance dressed, shall lift his hands and swear'!
The free circulation of books in modern times has rapidly increased the intellectual and moral requirements of the people. As the knowledge and practice of medicine had gone from the priesthood, and formed a distinct profession among laymen, so moral exhortations began to follow the same course. A multiplicity of lecturers arose, who made it their business to urge the neglected topics of temperance, anti-slavery, personal purity, the debasement of women, &c. Gradually, many of the clergy entered, in greater or less degrees, into the same labors, but the external church can never recover its lost opportunities. The people have become accustomed to hear better preaching out of the pulpit than they usually hear in it. The clergy waited for a stiff breeze of popular favor to fill the sails of their ship. The spirit of the age demanded steamboats that would two vessels into the harbor in the teeth of opposing winds. How much the people want leaders is shown by the spontaneous enthusiasm with which thousands flock to hear earnest, out-speaking men, like Theodore Parker and Henry Ward Beecher. However much their popularity may be owing to talent and learning, it owes still more to their unministerial way of saying things. Their sermons are not cut and dried, whereas a large proportion of clerical discourses are very effectually dried. They take up the topics of the hour, and use the phrases of the day. Instead of preaching against dead Pharisees in Judea, they hurl their shafts straight at Pharisees in Boston and New York.
But though it is a very obvious fact that the clergy, as a body, are followers and not leaders in progressive movements, we should remember that the fault is not in the men, but in their position. When a man earns his living by the administration of truth, and has a wife and children whose external welfare is dependent on his success, it requires more virtue than perhaps either you or I would possess not to offer truth of such quality and quantity as the majority of purchasers require. A soul must be preeminently free and strong that can preserve its freedom and strength under such heavy pressure of temptation. There have been noble examples of moral courage among the clergy, and they deserve more honor than other men who have done equally well, because their relation to the public renders it more difficult. Are the Quakers right in saying that the relation itself is a faulty one? My mind is not clearly made up on that subject. Moral and religious teachers are undoubtedly necessary; and if they perform their mission well, they are the greatest blessings society can have. Throughout the length and breadth of our land, there are some ministers, of all denominations, who deserve this high praise. But books, lecturers, and Sunday-school teachers now do a large share of the work which formerly devolved entirely on clergymen, and which remained undone if they failed to do it. Moreover, it cannot be concealed, even from the most superficial observers, that the external church of the present day does not satisfy the wants of the people. This is indicated by the indifference of a very large class about attending meeting, and by their drowsiness when there. Still more strikingly is it indicated by the restless seeking of other minds. Every where, see men coming out of old forms of the church into the new, and going back from the new into the old. When I see in every country village two or three meeting-houses and two or three ministers, and observe how few of the people believe in any law of action higher than respectability, custom, self-interest, or legal obligation, I cannot but ask myself whether they receive their money's worth of moral or intellectual benefit, for the two or three thousand dollars they annually expend for that purpose. If we could measure spiritual products as certainly as we can the grain raised by farmers, or count the horses shod by blacksmiths, I think the result would show that a majority of the clergy had little claim to be ranked among the productive classes. I have as me times found myself imagining a church where science might go hand in hand with moral instruction and devout feeling; where astronomical knowledge might be conveyed in clear, simple language, made more impressive by pictured illustrations of the movements of the planets; where chemical lectures, with suitable apparatus, might impart to the farmer, the mechanic, the nurse and the housewife many ideas that would prove useful in their daily business; where lessons of physiology might be gives, that would help to keep souls mere healthy, by teaching people how to keep the body in such a state as to be a wholesome tenement for the soul; where <illegible> history might be taught in such a manner as <illegal> and a feeling of protection fellowship with them, by the absence of which man lose no much pleasure and so much improvements of their own <illegal> where the past history and institutions, should be weighed in the balance
<c04>
ith established principles of justice and humanity; hare the highest order of music, married to inspiring words, should form a prominent part in the education of entire congregations. I should like to see that character, mental and moral, would be stamped upon our villages by fifty years of such training. The money annually expended in our towns for stated instruction would purchase a vast deal of information on these and similar subjects, without at all diminishing the amount of purely moral teaching. And why should we consider the sciences as things apart from religion? Surely, they are admirably calculated to remind us of the loving kindness of Him who made this wondrous world. In ancient times, the priesthood possessed such a knowledge as there was concerning astronomy, chemistry, and the laws of health; but they kept it to themselves, to increase their power. Why should they not now use a far more extended knowledge for better purposes? It seems to me it would enlarge their own sphere of thought and action, as well as that of their audiences. The long-tried theological teaching has not apparently produced the beat results. Is it not time to dispense with it, or, at least, to make it subordinate to things of more practical use, and more capable of positive demonstration? These queries have arisen, from time to time, in the privacy of my own mind. Perhaps they are of little worth, but such as they are, I impart them to you, as I would in the freedom of conversation. If they have no value in themselves, they may suggest valuable thoughts in other minds.
With a blessing on all honest efforts for human progress, in every direction, I am,
 Very respectfully, your friend,
 L. MARIA CHILD.
 TENDERED BESIGNATION OF REV. THEODORE FARKER.
At the close of services at the Music Hall on Sunday, the 16th inst., a parish meeting of the Twenty-Eighth Congregational Society was held, when the following letter from Rev. Theodore Parker was read by the Clerk of the Society, John R. Manley:
 MONTREUX, SWITEERLAND, Sept. 12, 1859. To the Members of the Twenty-Eighth Congregational Society in Boston:
DEAR AND MUCH VALUED FRIENDS,When I wrote you a long letter from Santa Crux, I did not quite like to say what now seems my duty to write, for I did not wish to destroy the feeble yet fondlycherished hope that I might one day speak from your pulpit again, and renew my ministry both in your meeting-house and your homes. Though the chances of a certain partial recovery and restoration to some power of work certainly seem greater now than ever before in this present year, yet from the unanimous testimony of skilful and experienced doctor, it appears pretty plain that I shall never be able to address large audiences as before; perhaps never again to speak in public at all; certainly not for years to come. Therefore it seems to me best that the ecclesiastic and official part of my relation to you as minister should cease immediately; the personal and friendly part I trust will never end. Accordingly, I now resign the great and important trust you confided to me several years ago.
Since my illness began, you have secured for your pulpit some of the best talent in America, and also, I think, its greatest genius. The services of so many able men no doubt give you a greater variety both of matter and manner of treatment than any one man could afford, unless, indeed, he were a quite extraordinary person. But still, in your public preaching, you have no man who feels such a personal interest and responsibility towards you as would lead him to study carefully the signs of the times, and the various significant events which continually happen, and report them in sermons for your instruction; in your private life, chequered all over with hopes and fears, joys and sorrows, gladdened by the new-born soul, or made sad by some loved one's departure, you have no one to perform that familiar domestic duty which , is yet a large and highly important part of the minister's function. I need not say how often my heart yearns towards such of you as have been in recent affliction, or has bounded to share your new or accustomed joys.
Of late, two New England men of extraordinary talents and conspicuous positionwhich each climbed up to from the humble place they were born in have passed off from this mortal scene, the pulpit taking suggestive notice of the fact; and I lamented that you had no minister who should feel it his duty to show you and the nation the comparative value of these two lives, so opposite and hostile in their chief characteristics, and so differently regarded by the controlling men of your townthe great, unscrupulous Advocate, whose chief aim was by any means to win his client's cause, to the great, self-denying Philanthropist, whose life was bravely devoted to the highest interests of his nation and his race, and finally given up with such characteristic ending as a sacrifice thereto. Besides, another man has lately gone to his reword from the scene of his philanthropic work in Boston, who spent his life for the criminal, the drunkard, and the harlot: his function was to cleanse the unclean, to save such as were ready to perish, and to love the unlovely; thus making the highest words of Jesus of Nazareth his daily profession of Christianity. Though he held no public office, sat on no platform of honor in public meetings, nor ever shared a civic feast, he yet did more service, I think, to Boston, than all her Mayors for thirty years. Now, the able and conscientious men who only speak to you from Sunday to Sunday, will not be likely to prepare laboriously for you, in special, a sermon on Rufus Choate, or Horace Mann, or John Augustus, or any public event even of the greatest importance, while any large-minded and generous-hearted man who was your regular minister would feel impelled to use them, and every signal event of the times, for the furtherance of your highest interests. I cannot bear to think I stand between you and a service I may never be able to perform again.
It is not easy nor pleasant to undo even the officialties which now join you and me, so closely knit and holding us so fast and pleasantly together when we have walked in steep and slippery places; but now I feel it were better, for I am only a weight which hinders your upward march. I trust you will soon find some man who will fill my place not only in your pulpit, but alsoperhaps the more difficult partin your homes and your hearts.
Do not fear that I shall ever be idle; if I recover but partially, I have yet much to do in which we can, still, perhaps, work together as heartily as before, though without any official connection. I know you will not think I shall ever lose the gratitude <illegal> I have so long felt towards you; for we have wept and prayed together, have been joyful with each other, jointly sharing the deep feelings and lofty ideas of absolute religion, and attending also to its works; and the memory of this will never fade out from your consciousness or mine. Let us be thankful to the dear God for all the good the past has brought us. And now for the future also, may ours be the absolute trust in that Infinite Perfection which is Father and Mother to us allthe Truth that prevails, the Hope that endures, and the Love which never fails. So hopes and prays affectionately and faithfully, Your friend,
 THEODORE PARKER.
The reading of this letter was the occasion of much sorrow to many, who had not anticipated so speedy and unwelcome intelligence.
The meeting was addressed by various members of the society, who all spoke against the acceptance of the proffered resignation; and the following resolution a offered by Rufus Leighton, Jr., were unanimously <illegal>
<illegal> that while we rejoice in the improved

health of our minister, and the prospect of his being ultimately restored to his former vigor and usefulness, we sincerely regret that he should deem it best at this time to sever his official connection with us as minister of this Society.
Resolved, That, in view of his past services in our behalf, and his success in building up this free church in the face of obstacles which have been neither few nor small, we desire that his name shall still be connected with it, and that we may still call him our minister,conscious that such a connection will be for our good, though we miss the guidance of his counsels and the daily blessings of his presence.
Resolved, That we respectfully and affectionately decline to accept his resignation, and that our refusal be accompanied with the assurance of our continued gratitude and veneration.

From the Glasgow Commonwealth of September 24.
DEATH OF PROFESSOR NICHOL.
By the death of Professor Nichol, which took place at the hydropathic establishment at Rothesay, on Monday afternoon, Glasgow is deprived of one of her best known, most popular, and most distinguished citizens. For the last year. Dr. Nichol's health had been far from robust, and he had found it advisable to seek some relaxation from those labors which, in his case, may be said to have been perpetual. Even as an invalid, his untiring industry afforded little cessation from the mental activity for which the now lamented Professor was ever remarkable, and to the last he was engaged in his favorite pursuits with undiminished ardor and undiminished success. From time to time he had sought relief in the hydropathic treatment, from which he appeared to derive temporary benefit; but we now, with deep and unfeigned regret, record that the genial orator and generous man has passed a way, and that he will no more delight his fellow-country men with his eloquencecharm with the graces of his conversationinspire the young with the nobility of his sentiments, or instruct and dazzle with the brilliant play of his ever teeming imagination. Scotland has not had many citizens like John Pringle Nichol, and those who knew him will not soon expect to see his equal. He was one whom nature makes a universal favorite. With old and young, wise and stupid, learned and unlettered, it was the same. He found his way to all hearts. His merry laugh, his genial wit, his consummate tact, his rare power of anecdote, his inexhaustible fund of information, his fresh and manly impulse, and last, perhaps not least, the genuine kindliness of his nature, made his presence everywhere and with all classes most welcome and most acceptable. Nor should we be doing justice to his memory were we to omit the circumstance that he had the singular faculty of combining the most opposite qualities. With a highly conservative and essentially aristocratic nature, he could fearlessly launch into the troubled sea of democratic speculation: and, himself the last man who would have sanctioned a breach of order, he was the fast and firm friend of even the wildest exiles who look on anarchy as the true solution of European difficulties. With the happiest and readiest tact, he could take the sting out of seeming denunciations; and though differing from many in the statement of principles, it is questionable whether he ever lost the respect of any whose respect was worth possessing, even when he slaughtered their idols, or trespassed on what they supposed their consecrated ground. He was, indeed, a man of many rare virtues, and we feel assured that his departure has not taken place without calling forth the most widely spread sympathy. Many are the thoughts that during the last few days will have turned to the house set on the hill, but not one, we feel assured, that would not bear with it a kindly element of affectionate regard, or a sorrowful feeling of regret.
Dr. Nichol was born, we understand, in the year1804, at Brechin, Forfarshire, and though intended originally for trade, exhibited so early a tendency to literature that he was sent to the University of Aberdeen, where he took high honors, and gained the reputation of being a first class student, He was then, at an unusually early age, appointed schoolmaster of the parish of Dun. From Dun he removed to the town of Hawick; from Hawick to Cupar; from Cupar to Montrose, where among his pupils he numbered no less than Lola Montes, of universal notoriety. During his career as an instructor, he studied with a view to the Church, and may possibly have been licensed as a preacher. But his tastes were towards science and literature, and be devoted himself so earnestly to astronomy, that in 1836 he was appointed by Lord Melbourne to the chair of Practical Astronomy in the University of Glasgowthe observatory and the residence attached having, we believe, been built after Dr. Nichol's own plans, the latter with the peculiarity of a central room or hall, used as the library, out of which all the other apartments are made to enter. Of his official position, Dr. Nichol made no sinecure, nor had he the most remote conception of mumbling through a course of perfunctionary duty. He carried vitality with him wherever be went, and lived his too-short life in a glow of industry quite extraordinary when the number of visits received and paid are taken into account. Strangers of distinction sought the astronomer almost as a matter of course, and Dr. Nichol not only visited America, where his lectures were received with unbounded popularity, but at home he lectured to delighted audiences in almost every considerable town in Scotland, and some of the principal towns in England. Only last winter, even when the state of his health could ill afford the exertion, he lectured in Hope Hall, Liverpool, going up by train on the same day, and returning by train when the lecture was over, being thus absent from the Observatory four and twenty hourstoo fast a pace for life to last out to three score and ten, but showing the indomitable spirit that bravely battled out to the end, till the cold hand of arrestment was laid on the earthly toil. In the midst of all this activity, Dr. Nichol never ceased the labors of the pen, nor had the pen ever a more chivalrous follower. He wrote books, articles, treatises, lectures, biographies, learned dissertations for the grave, or pleasant jests for his friends. Indeed, of all the men that Scotland has produced in recent times. Dr. Nichol is essentially the one that most exhibits the better qualities of the English Sheridansimilar qualities differently applied. His best known works are his astronomical treatisesthe ' Architecture of the Heavens,' the ' Planetary System,' the ' Solar System; ' but he could have written comedy with the same success as he could discourse on science. What his rank may be among the Dryasdusts of science we know not, nor care to inquire; but this we know, that what the people of Scotland have been taught of astronomy, they owe to Thomas Chalmers and John Pringle Nicholthe one taking the theologic view of the firmament, the other the scientific, or rather the artisticfor Dr. Nichol viewed astronomy as the divine art, which displays the immortal wisdom, and reveals the harmony of creation. Whatever Dr. Nichol's scientific acquirements might have beenhowever his stores might have accumulated through length of time and observation, he never could have been merely a scientific man a tame collector of facts and ingenious framer of laws. Had he known ten times as much as Newton, he never could have been Newton. He was an artist rather than a cultivator of pure science. Science <illegal> truth merelyart seeks the beauty of truth and literature seeks its expression. To art and literature he drew impulsivelynot to science. Science was his material, but art his life. It is thus that we must read his influence. A notable man has this week <illegal> away from Scotland, but his influence will long survive, and it will survive not so much from the amount of knowledge communicated as from the impulse which he unquestionably gave to the higher studies that present themselves to human understanding. In France or Germany, Dr. Nichol would have been a man of national renown; and though it cannot be said that Scotland did not highly esteem his talents and his labors, we fancy that the admiration was often bestowed on the things temporary and evanescent, while the genuine and sterling excellence was sometimes overlooked, or sometimes even misunderstood. As a <illegal> Dr. Nichol took his place in the very foremost lank. As an expositor, he was pre-eminently successful. The lucid perspicuity of his style, his appropriate and well-chosen language, his ready illustration, his point, and, withal, a certain graceful good nature which accompanied his admirable delivery, made him at once singularly entertaining and instructive. His lectures on the United States were models of instructive discourse, while good judges have always esteemed his astronomical lectures as the most brilliant displays that have ever been made in this country in the form of popular science. So accomplished a man is rarely met with in this country or any other. The last occasion on which he appeared in public was , if we mistake not, on the 27th of May, when he pre-
<c06>
sided at a meeting held in the City Hall, to hear Kossuth on Non-intervention. Dr. Nichol leaves to regret his loss a widow, and a son and daughter by a first marriage. It is gratifying to record that the hereditary talent is not wanting in this instance, and that Mr. Nichol has already distinguished him-self by taking first class honors at Oxford.
METHODIST MISSIONARIES AMONG THE INDIANS.
At the late meeting in Fanenil Hall, in behalf of the Indians, Wendell Phillips, Esq. said many things which were true and appropriate, but the following remarks, as reported by the Liberator, are as incorrect as they seem severe:
'The Methodist Missionaries in Oregon found some way to get all the lands into their power, and then left off preaching to live like princes. In Kansas, we are assured, the mission stations succored the Border Ruffians, and sometimes were the haunts where Border Ruffians planned their incursions; one of their leaders being himself a missionary preacher.'
We are assured, however, by Mr. Phillips, that the statements were given him by other parties whom he had considered entirely reliable, and that he is happy to know and to credit the virtues and labors of our missionaries.
We have no doubt that Mr. Phillips was misinformed. The first company of missionaries from the M.E. Church were Jason Les, Daniel Lee, and Mr. Shepherd. They went by land on the call of there Indian Chiefs who had come over the mountains and through the wilderness, begging that white men would return with them, and instruct them and their people in the arts of civilization and the way to heaven.
The selection of these men was a happy one. Mr. Shepherd died early, a severe sufferer; Jason Lee, after years of extreme toil, broke down his iron constitution, and died a poor man. Daniel Lee, after a long siege of labor and perplexity, returned in feeble health, rich only in the reward of the faithful.
Other men good and true were sent to their aid, and still others to supply their places, but not to 'live like princes.' They have been hard working men, laboring for that ' which perisheth not.'
It may be proper to remark that Oregon is a great country, and that it is hardly a supposable case that a few missionaries could, if disposed, get possession of all the lands, or of any considerable part of them, and it is certain that they did not. It may be that more than one of them has become a farmer, but the only instance within our knowledge is that of Rev. D. Leslie. He went many years age from the New England Conference. He continued in the missionary work till his health failed, owing in part to severe labor and exposure, and, perhaps, somewhat to the loss of a daughter, who was murdered by hostile Indians while on a journey.
We believe his example as a Christian and a man of business is beneficial to the Indians. We learn that he gets a good living, and we sure that none would hinder or envy him. We will only add in relation to missionaries in Oregon, that the Missionary Society of the M.E. Church would not allow its ministers to pursue the course reported to Mr. Phillips.
To sustain the honor of the M.E. Church in Kansas, it is proper to remark that some of the Indian missions in that Territory are in charge of the 
Church South. The notorious Johnson was one of their missionaries. There might have been another who was no better. But they were not of us, and of course we are not responsible for them. We abhor their conduct as much as any one can, and for their personal condemnation we would gladly avail ourselves of the eloquence of Wendell Phillips.
But we have reason to be proud of the doings of our own men, as representatives of whom and among the foremost of freedom's champions are Lovejoy, Denison, Goodnow, Dennis, Gen. Lane and Dr. Doy. Zion's Herald.

HOPEDALE LANDS OPENED FOR SETTLEMENT.
We bespeak attention to Br. E.D. Draper's advertisement as above, offering for sale sundry pareels of Hopedale land. Some two years since, when most of the Joint Stock Property of the Hopedale Community was individualized and divided among the stock-holders, a large portion of the Community Domain went legitimately into the private possession of Br. Draper. He has recently caused his lands to be surveyed into homesteads of from two to twenty acres each, with a view to offer them for sale to persons friendly to our distinguishing principles, who may choose to settle in our midst. We hope that a goodly number of friends, cherishing a general sympathy with our people, and desiring to give their children the advantages of our excellent select and common schools, will avail themselves of the new opening. Seeing that we must be disappointed in not realizing the Unitary social arrangements, the anticipation of which originally at traced us hither, the next best thing is, to see as good a Neighborhood built up as circumstances will allow. We are therefore pleased with Br. Draper's new plan of offering small homesteads for sale to our friends scattered abroad. May the movement be crowned with success.Pactical Christian.

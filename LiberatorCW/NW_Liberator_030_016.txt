REFUGE OF OPPRESSION.
<c01>
From the Mountain (Richmond) Democrat, March 29.
THE BEREA DIFFICULTIES.
Word having been conveyed to the Vigilance Committee that the man Hanson, notwithstanding the three visits already made to Berea for his benefit, had again returned, with the avowed intention of remaining, a portion of the committee, to the number of eighteen or twenty, hastily collected together on Monday morning, and proceeded to Berea, for the purpose of removing Hanson from the limits of the county. The Circuit Court being in session, and a majority of the committee being retained as lawyers, grand and petit jurors, and witnesses, and the general expectation that the visit would prove as fruitless in its efforts to find Hanson as the previous ones had been, will account for the small number that went. Those present, generally, wore side arms-three fowling pieces only being in the crowd.
While on the road to Berea, the committee met Green Haley, who, it had been currently reported to the committee, had used very blustering language as to what he and others intended doing if the committee ever visited that way. Upon being questioned, Haley denied such language, stating that he might have spoken excitedly in relation to the matter, but that the did not wish to have anything farther to do with it. The committee were satisfied, and rode back.
Stopping at Berea, the committee were informed that Hanson was at a certain house, some three miles farther on. The committee proceeded to the house indicated, and as they rode up, a woman emerged from the rear, and struck across the fields. After a thorough search, the house was found to be tenanted solely by women. No one in the shape of a man was observed, and the general supposition is that Hanson escaped, as they rode up, in female disguise.
On the way home, when near Slate Lick Springs, some two miles beyond where the mill of Hanson is located, the committee came across some thirty men, headed by Green Haley, and armed with rifles and shot guns. The leader of the committee, Colonel Reuben Munday, rode forward, and asked if the party were for peace of war. The answer was, that they understood that the committee had Hanson under arrest, and that they intended to rescue him.
The party drawn across the road immediately fired at the committee, who dismounted, hitched their horses, and returned the fire. After the first, fire, the opposite party commenced a drawback movement, retreating to an taking refuge in a house, forming it into a temporary fort. The committee followed them closely, and returned their fire, until having housed them, and their ammunition giving out, they retired. Some three or four rounds were fired by each party, with intermediate discharges from the weapons of parties on either side.
Two of opposite party are known to be wounded, perhaps more. We heard a report on Monday night that one man was known to have been killed, but could trace it to no responsible source. On the side of the committee, not a scratch was received.
On the return of a portion of the committee with the news of the fight, the excitement in town raged to a fever hear, and every one commenced preparing for a brush the next day. Rifles, shot guns, pistols, powder, buckshot and lead, were in request, and from all portions of the town was heard the buzz of preparation.
On Tuesday morning, the people commenced assembling at the place of rendezvous, and by ten o'clock between one hundred and fifty and one hundred and sixty men had collected, who proceeded to the locality of the previous day's conflict, and made a thorough search of every house and possible place of concealment for miles around. No enemy was found, however, and the committee returned. The only event of interest occurring on Tuesday was the dismantling of the mill belonging to the man Hanson.
To-day our town has settled down into its usual quiet.
We earnestly hope that the demonstrations made on Monday and Tuesday last will have the effect of showing the man Hanson and all others of that <illegible>ilk, that their presence here is a source of irritation, leading otherwise innocent men into trouble, probably causing the loss of valuable lives. The lesson of the last few days, we think, will not be lost upon them, and Hanson has, before this time, no doubt, left this portion of the State, and will hereafter profit by our advice-never to show his face among us. If he does, we will not be answerable for the consequences.

THE GARRISON ULTRAS.
PARKER PILLSBURY is one of the bright and shining lights of the Garrisonians-the extreme ultra Abolitionists, who insist upon the instant abolition of slavery, and invoke dissolution, servile and civil war, and all the evils and horrors which such events would naturally bring in their train. Mr. PILLSBURY has recently been upon a lecturing tour, during which he has twice favored this city with his presence, and lectured to small gatherings of people, a dozen of whom may have been sympathizers. Frederick Douglass's Paper of last week alludes to his last effort here as a display of Ishmaelitish qualities which it does not endorse. It remarks that 'when a man gets into the habit of striking out right and left, giving foul blows as well as fair ones, and hitting the friends of his cause more often and harder than its enemies, we think it time that the rules of the ring should be enforced.'
That paper then proceeds to show the absurdity of PILLSBURY'S position in advocating a Personal Liberty Bill, but at the same time advising his hearers to refuse to vote, and denouncing all who do vote as participating in a slaveholding Government, and sustaining a slave Constitution.
Again Mr. PILLSBURY'S inconsistency is thus exhibited:
'Another illustration of Mr. P' s sublime contempt for the logical relation of things was manifest in his course with reference to Senator Seward. After having denounced the Democrats in general, and S. A. Douglas in particular, until even the Garrisonian dictionary was 'broke,' and could furnish no more vitriolized epithets, he coolly told his hearers that he had much rather see Mr. Douglas President than to have Mr. Seward elected. He has taken up a special 'wo' against Mr. Seward, and seems to have had a new 'revelation' of that well-abused Senator's dark deeds of late. We cannot understand why Mr. Seward should come in for this terrible flood of vituperative Anglo-Saxon, just at this juncture. We do not like his sentiments, or rather his recent political manifesto; but we fail to see any new cause for pouring the phials of Garrisonian wrath upon him just at this time. Mr. Seward makes much too large concessions to slavery, in our judgment; but his last speech concedes no more than he has conceded in all his speeches for ten years. The rhetoric of this late speech is a little more subdued and polished than in some of his older speeches, but the principles enunciated are the same as those heretofore advocated by him. We do not see, therefore, why the Garrisonians should have
<c02>
made this sudden onslaught upon him, and as he is the best man the Republicans are likely to nominate, we have no sympathy with this special attack upon him.'
Mr. SEWARD is as unacceptable to GARRISON, PILLSBURY & Co., as to the Albany Atlas and the Virginia and South Carolina organs of sham Democracy. Intensely as they concur in hating Senator DOUGLAS, they prefer him to Senator SEWARD. This is another instance in which extremes meet.-Rochester (Republican) Democrat.

THE ENTERING WEDGE.
The socialists and revolutionists, who dominate in the Republican party, made another advance movement in the Senate of the United States on Saturday. Mr. Trumbull, Republican Senator from Illinois, presented, in behalf or the sectional party, a petition that the Senate would recommend the Legislatures of the States to request Congress to call a convention to amend the Constitution of the United States, by the establishment of a line running across the Republic, North of which slave labor should be prohibited, and South of which it should be permitted. The petition was referred to the Judiciary Committee. No man can doubt the object of the petitioners, or the result which would attend a convention called in compliance with their prayer. The dissolution of the Union would inevitably follow. Trumbull sees it and knows it. But he dares not resist the socialists and fanatics of the Republican organization, who, though in a minority, yet control the party. The instant the Republican leaders refuse to obey the Wendell Phillips and Gerrit Smith gang, that instant they die. We think that majority of the Republican party only intend to prevent the extension of slave labor into new Territories, but these men, honest, simple-hearted as they are, have no more positive control in the Republican organization than a poodle dog would have in a cage of infuriated wild-cats. The fanatics who direct the Republican party mean to break up this Union, because, like Garrison, they believe it to be 'a covenant with death and an agreement with hell'; and Trumbull on Saturday put in an entering wedge.-Boston Post.

THE MORAL OF THE SANBOBN RUMPUS.
The Republican party of Massachusetts is divisible into two classes, the deceivers and the deceived. The latter claw in made up of honest men, who fear that the Democratic party is going too far in defence of Southern rights, and who act with the Republican organization, thinking it has no purpose in view other than prevention of extension of slavery into new territories of the United States, The former class is made up of fanatics and rogues; of men like Garrison, Phillips, Parker, Emerson, Howe and Higginson, who are the red Republicans, the Zouaves, the Turcos of the Republican organization. They are the deceivers. They are in a minority; but yet by more physical and intellectual force, more baseness, they control the majority who are the deceived. They are not more than two hundred thousand in number throughout the entire North, and yet they compel the Republican organization to do their bidding. They control legislative bodies, and they are beginning to terrify the courts. They prevented any Republican in Congress from denouncing the Helper Book. They are the drunken mutineers who have taken possession of the North, and they are animated but by one common inspiration, which is hatred of the South, and animosity to the Federal Government. They look upon Washington as the seat of a foreign and an inimical power.
The recent Sanborn affair furnishes another fact I-or series of facts-to make apparent the purposes of the Republican party under the domination of these political Zouaves.
The central figure in the affair, Sanborn, is, we think, of no possible consequence in any public relation of the transaction. He is one of the scatterbrained, half-educated zealots, who abound in the Republican party. Well enough, he may be, to teach boys and girls chemistry and vulgar fractions, but with no thoughts or ideas above that. We understand him to be of no more account than even the smallest of the one-sided men in Massachusetts, who forever babble about the rights of negroes, and think that the end of all government.
In the view we are now taking, the decision of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, upon the very narrow question whether the Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate could delegate his authority, is but an incident of the main subject.
The great fact which the occurrence illustrates is this-that the Republican leaders are determined to treat the Federal Government as a foreign and hostile power.
It will not alter the case if Col. McNair, the excellent officer of the Senate, comes here, and arrests Sanborn in person. The same resistance will be made to him by these scoundrels who control the Republican party. There will be the same straining after legal quibbles, with which to annoy and <illegible>wart the Senate of the United States.
Now, what has occasioned all this disturbance and violation of public law? Nothing but the desire land effort of the Senate of the United States to have Sanborn go before a Committee of that body, and tell what he knows about John Brown's invasion of Virginia. Others have gone there cheerfully for the same purpose, and have borne testimony to the kind and courteous treatment they have received from the Committee. But the Republican leaders in Concord, in order to defy the Federal Government, have inspired the weak brain of Sanborn to be their dupe, and disobey the authority which all good citizens have promptly recognized. We repeat that the affair, in its present aspect, is of no consequence, except as it illustrates how the Republican party means to nullify the laws of Congress, to spit on the Constitution, and in the end either to humiliate the South, or else put them in an attitude of armed resistance to aggression. All the glorification of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts for its conduct in releasing Sanborn, is but the expression of joy at victory over the Federal Government. A blow has been struck in Concord at the Constitution, sad for that they are glad.-Boston Post.

LOVEJOY AND PRYOR.
In an abusive article upon the late rousing anti-slavery speech of Mr. Lovejoy in the U. S. House of Representatives, the New York Herald says:-
Let us see who and what the principal combatants are. Lovejoy belongs to a miserable class of low politicians, representatives of which abound in all the legislative bodies in the Northern States, and sometimes get into Congress, very much to the gratification of their immediate neighbors. They are generally briefless lawyers, or broken-down editors, or persons who have failed in some honest pursuit , and take to politics for a living with the same views as they would have in going to rob on the highway. Lovejoy himself is a demagogue of the cast-iron order. He is a broken-down editor, nigger-stealer, and nigger-worshipper. He <illegible>ale his god before he worships him-a most economical arrangement. His
<c03>
attack upon the slaveholders was quite characteristic. He was as well aware as any one else that, when he abused the great landed proprietors of the South, every word that he uttered was false in its spirit. The gentlemen of whom he spoke are, as a class, refined, cultivated, generous, and far more considerate and humane to their servants than many of the employers of white laborers at the North. All over the civilized world, the name of American Southerner is synonymous with chivalry, generosity and good-breeding. We are describing now the slaveholder, not the poor white man at the South. It is to that class that Lovejoy's comrade, Pryor, belongs. They are, though nominally opposed, in fact brothers-in-arms. Pryor does not own slaves. He is, like Lovejoy, a broken-down editor, and is not considered in his own State or elsewhere as a gentleman. He represents in an eminent degree the poor white men of the South, and meanest of them-the noisy, ruffianly, needy politician. Lovejoy is the type of the nigger-worshipper; Pryor is the beau ideal of the nigger-driver, distinct from the nigger-owner. Lovejoy is a republican border ruffian; Pryor occupies a similar position on the other side. Neither the member from Illinois nor he from Virginia represent, in any way, the constituencies which, unfortunately for the good name of the republic and the boasted civilization of the age, sent them to Washington. Their conduct in the affair of Thursday, in which they were the principal actors, (the others were merely bottle-holders, having undoubtedly emptied the bottles before they came to the House,) was what might be expected of them. To gain notoriety, they would stop at nothing.

LOVEJOY.
The New York Tribune chuckles over the Abolition tirade made by Mr. Lovejoy in the U. S. House of Representatives, on Thursday. The Tribune's Washington correspondent calls it 'a tremendous phillppic!' It was a paltry harangue, both useless and unprovoked. Slavery Mr. Lovejoy styled a twin relic, with polygamy, of barbarism, and he poured forth a strain of the worst calumny on the South. The speaker was as coarse in his manners as in his language. He left his seat, and while talking shook his fist at the Democratic members. The consequence, of course, was a disgraceful scene. Southern men, stung to the quick with the offensive manner and matter of the Illinoisan, gave vent to a natural feeling of resentment, and at one time a collision between Democrats and Republicans seemed inevitable. Mr. L Lovejoy, evidently alarmed at the tempest he had roused, moderated his tone, and was allowed to finish with only a few sharp interruptions. Mr. Lovejoy is a fair specimen of the Seward-Helperites, and his conduct in the House was truly 'republican.' His gross personalities and insulting fanaticism almost occasioned a mortal combat in the U. S. Congress-apparently what he and his fellow Republicans ardently desire.-Boston Post.

POPULAR REACTION.
The people, assisted by an independent journalism, have begun the reaction against fanaticism and political roguery. Their eyes are beginning to be opened to the destructive tendencies of such political philosophers as Lysander Spooner and Theodore Parker, such politicians as William H. Seward and John Brown, and such fanatics as Wendell Phillips and William Lloyd Garrison. It is clearly seen that these blind leaders aim to destroy the fraternal commerce between the North and the South, as they have succeeded in breaking the fraternal ties of religious communion and party fellowship between them. It is clearly seen that the principles of the black republican party are utterly destructive to the Constitution, which is now the only safeguard of our Union, our liberties, our peace, our commerce, and our prosperity. The issue comes home to every merchant, every manufacturer, every farmer, every banker, every laborer, every artisan, every miner, and every ship-owner. Whoever has a material stake in the present, and whoever has sons to whom the future must be preserved, has a direct interest in the coming political issue. The people of New England, with whom the sentiment of material evil is so quick, have perceived the danger, and have begun the reaction against the mania of abolitionism, which is destined to fall before the rising conservatism of the country, as have its preceding manias of anti-masonry, temperance, know-nothingism, and their kindred fallacies.-New York Herald.

SELECTIONS.
SPEECH OF HON. B. R. JOHNSON,
ON THE
PERSONAL LIBERTY BILL,
IN THE NEW YORK ASSEMBLY, MARCH 14, 1860.
MR. CHAIRMAN-In my judgment, the question now before the House is the most interesting and important of any that can come before this or any other legislative body. We are personally and politically, individually and collectively interested in this issue-an issue that overtops and overshadow the canal question-the pro-rata question-the questions of finance-of commerce-of education-of improvements-indeed, it is the leading question of the day. Without Personal Liberty, of what value are the graces and accomplishments of education? Learning only opens the eyes wider to behold the miseries of inthrallment-wealth could not line the yoke with silk soft enough to prevent the galling effects of slavery-luxury cannot drug the soul into a state of happiness, while the body is a beast of burden imbruted by oppression. I think no gentleman within the hearing of my voice would exchange the humblest poverty in freedom, with its crust of bread and cup of water, and bed of straw, and life of labor, for the most splendid slavery the ingenuity of man can suggest.
While I desire liberty for myself, I desire it also for my neighbors, as well as myself. I could not sit in silence, and witness the inthrallment of the humblest of my constituents, or of yours, whether his skin was so thin and fair you could see his heart pulse with a love for liberty-or black as night, with soul shining through it, as the start pierce through the darkness.
I know your hearts echo with these sentiment. There is not a man here who would not say to the kidnapper, hands off; that is not a chattel; he is a man; he is a constituent of mine; he is my neighbor, and I am taught to love my neighbor as myself; you shall not steal him and put the yoke on his neck, and brand slave on his forehead. This would be the natural language of every American whose heart is in the right place throbbing with noble impulse,
Did I not commit myself to this bill, I should be ashamed to return home to Delaware, and look my constituents in the face.
The citizens of that country whom I in part have the honor to represent, appreciate freedom, and they do not desire to hear the clanking of chains among their hills, and by their river sides.
<c04>
They do not limit liberty to the white alone, but extend it to the black-to men and women of every climate and complexion, irrespective of creed or politics, so long as they are law-abiding citizens-and they regard even colored men as citizens, notwithstanding Judge Taney made an effort to repeal the law of God, and blot out the rights of a race in his infamous decision.
I repeat it, sir, I would not dare to return to my constituents, if I did not make an effort to secure the passage of this bill. The streams, unwinding from their spools of rocks, would shout 'traitor! and the hills would echo with the rebuke.
I support a personal liberty bill, because I am jealous of the encroachments of Slavery, and deem it dangerous to our liberties to permit the South to make a hunting ground of the North.
But why am I jealous of slavery? Why is it! that so many dread it more than they do the 'pestilence that wasteth at noon '? It is claimed by the Administration party to be a national institution, supported by the Constitution and sanctioned by the Scriptures. Have we not even heard of a Northern clergyman taking a South-side view of it? and of a Northern lawyer who declared it a blessing-a benign-a just-a lawful and righteous institution? yes, it is claimed that slavery is right-that it is right to steal a man, and then rob him of his earnings-rob him of his liberty-rob him of his family.
I know not how others come to such a conclusion; for my own part, I entertain different views of right, and of the rights of man.
I hold, sir, that man has rights derived from nature; that they are the gift of God, and that community cannot annul them. The person, while innocent of crime, must not be sacrificed to society. The rights of which I speak, preceded all human organizations, and that society was formed to protect them, and not to destroy them. That sense of; moral obligation which exists in the breast of every human creature, be he European, Asiatic, or African, brings with it a sense of duty, and repeats the beautiful lesson that we are to do unto others, as we would have others do unto us.
The holy emotion that teaches what we should do to others, plainly teaches what others should do to us. The intuitions which restrain one class of men from injuring another class of men, command the latter to do no harm to the former. When conscience forbids the block to do harm to the white, it also forbids the white to do harm to the black, Conscience is not a local attribute, to be used only <illegible> a week and in certain latitudes-it is a universal law of our being, and cannot be hemmed in by State lines, nor gagged by statutes, nor smothered by cotton. You may cane it-call it hard names-imprison it-hang it-burn it in effigy-baptize it with blood-bury it under thrones-it still lives, and breathes, and speaks, because it is the voice of God in the soul.
I need not catalogue the rights of man. It must be admitted that he has a right to advance his own happiness and the welfare of others. He has a right to make himself better and wiser. He has a right to improve his condition. He has a right to be regarded as a member of the community in which he lives-a right to be sheltered under the aegis of the law-a right to be saved from the indignities-the inhumanity-the coercive cruelty of slavery, so long as he does not trespass on the rights of others. He has a right to social and domestic happiness, and the endearing relations of husband and lather. Slavery assails all these rights-it will not permit the slave to advance his own welfare-it will not allow him to improve his mind, for learning among the slaves is a crime at the South-it scouts the idea of his being a member of society. It allows him to marry, and then steals his wife-it permits him to occupy the relation of father, and then kidnaps his babes from the cradle-it deprives him of the right of self-defence. He must submit to the punishment of the excoriating lash from those whom he has not consented to serve-slavery tramples all the rights of man in the dust-it disfranchises him-it blots-out his manhood-it degrades him to the level of the brute-it impiously attempts to wipe out the image of God, and write beast upon his forehead.
Shall we say Amen to those who declare slavery a divine institution? Do we desire it to come here, and snatch away a human being, that he may be converted into a chattel?
Our State is a free State, except the few voluntary white slaves, who seem to be anxious to show their loyalty to the peculiar institution, by returning fugitives to their masters.
This is the Empire State-empire in territory-in internal improvements-in wealth and in population. And God forbid that she should become a hunting ground for masters, with creatures wearing administration collars on their necks, to pursue the panting fugitive flying for freedom!
Picture to yourself some slave, whose love of liberty has not been entirely blotted out, who believes with Washington and Jefferson, that all men have an inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, turning his face toward freedom, and following the light of that lamp which God hangs on the blue walls of heaven, till he finds himself within the borders of the free States. But look ,again, and see just behind him come the master and United States marshals, and all the apparatus for hunting human game.
The slave, who has been running the gauntlet of human blood-hounds and bullets, hiding himself in caves and dens by day, and fording streams, wading swamps, threading forests by night-feeding on bark and berries, or the crumbs of charity thinly scattered along his perilous pathway, takes to his heels, or, as has been said, 'prays with his feet.' Hotly pursued, be hurries on to Valley Forge, where the blood of our fathers re-appears in the wild flowers, and the purity of their patriotism is emblemed in the aroma of the darlings of the rain and sunshine. He hurries past Ticonderoga, where the spirit of Ethan Allen whispers a word of encouragement, in the name of the 'Great God and the Continental Congress.' On, on, he speeds through Saratoga, and over other battle grounds made classic in history, and finally be reaches the capital of the State of New York. The representatives of the people are here assembled. He dashes through the door-way-leaps over the gate, and, bounding down the aisle, he finally seeks shelter by the side, or under the desk of my friend Powell. It is a mere accident, but he could not have done a happier thing.
Now comes the tug of war. The Speaker has issued no ticket to this lobby member. The House has passed no resolution granting him its privilegem and yet he is unmolested. Perchance some member hurls at him the statute book, but a friend of the oppressed wards off the missile-another flings the Constitution of the United States at him-another the Bible-another holds up the bugaboo of a dissolved Union; but still be is safe. The door keepers hold back the hunter.
The poor slave is spirited away upon the underground railroad. He reaches Niagara, and beholds the white cloud beckoning him to be free. He hears the waterfall shouting freedom, and be passes under the arch of rainbows to the dominions of Queen
<c05>
Victoria, for liberty-for personal liberty. Humiliating, indeed! Fleeing from a republic to a monarchy for freedom!
But it is claimed that this law is unconstitutional; that it conflicts with the Fugitive Slave Law.
Sir I believe that this bill is constitutional, and that the Fugitive Slave Law is a base violation of a our federal compact.
This, proposed law in no manner conflicts with the Constitution of New York. In this State men are not chattels, and must not be treated like brutes. Here the right of trial by jury is recognized without inquiries respecting complexion. Here he has a right to counsel, and when his life, or his liberty which is dearer still, is at stake, he has a right to challenge the jurors summoned to try him. Now, air, shall the Fugitive Slave Code step in here and be admitted as an exception, refusing an innocent man the assistance it gives to the burglar and assassin?
Is the love of liberty a virtue in a white man, and a crime in a black man? Such a crime that he shall not have a fair trial-no counsel-no jury-not even a hearing in self-defence?
Through this bill we ask the Legislature to affirm that God created all men free and equal-that color is not a crime-that negro blood is not a disqualification for citizenship-that God has made of one blood all the nations of the earth.
We say by this bill that when the slaveholder brings his slave to this State, he holds him no longer, but frees him by that act. We say we do not desire our State officers to wear collars upon their necks, and become human hounds.
It is a libel upon our State Constitution, defective in other respects as it may be, to say that this bill conflicts with it.
I further claim that it does not conflict with the Constitution of the United States.
It is not the spirit or letter of that instrument to prevent States from passing enactments of this character. Each State, in certain respects, is an absolute and independent government. Hence it is that we have incorporated in our Republican platform, that we will not attempt to interfere with slavery in the States where it is the creature of local law.
We have delegated a part of our sovereign power to the Federal Government, not for the subjugation of men, not to oppress them, but to protect their rights-their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Sir, before the framing and ratification of the Constitution, this State declared that no person should be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law, including, of course, the right of trial by jury.
The Federal Constitution does not repeal this established law. This aegis of protection is afforded to all, irrespective of color or birth.
I hold that the Fugitive Slave Law is unconstitutional, and violates the provisions of the organic law of this State. It pays no respect to due process of law-tramples upon trial by jury-drags a man from the State merely upon the strength of ex parte evidence.
This infamous slave law can have no binding force here, because we have never surrendered our rights in this direction. We are an independent and sovereign State, and have never consented to sacrifice the person of any human being on the altar of arbitrary enactments.
We have now, as we have always had, the right, the legal, constitutional right, to protect all persons on our soil, irrespective of color, or creed, or conditions in life.
Article tenth, in the amendments to the Constitution, declares: 'The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States or the people.'
Some of our greatest statesmen and jurists have held, that the clause of the Constitution, referring to fugitives from service, was to be executed by the action and law of the State where the runaway should be discovered; and that it did not confer any grant of power upon the general government.
Why, sir, in the Federal Constitution, the word slave-the term slavery cannot be found.
This is one of the strongest evidences, that slavery was not endorsed by our patriot fathers.
Let us pass this bill, and nail our flag to the mast of freedom. Let us speak with emphasis, and say that our banner does not wave with stars for tyrants, and with stripes for slaves. Let us stand up for the honor of this noble State. Let us stand by the rights of man-rights guarantied to us by the Constitution.
I stand by this bill, sir, and urge its passage, because it is right and just, patriotic, humane and scriptural.
Mr. Chairman, have we a right to peril the freedom of forty-five thousand colored citizens of this State? Is it right to convert the three millions four hundred thousand whites into kidnappers? Must we be subject to fine and imprisonment if we give a cup of cold water, or a crust of bread, or a I refuge from the storm, to a poor slave? Are we to be compelled by law to aid the master to catch his slave, and help him with his human chat<illegible>el, on to the land of chains, and stripes, and slavery-hope-less, cruel, <illegible> slavery?
Is it fair for a quarter of a million of slaveholders to rule with a rod of iron, not only the four millions of slaves, and the free people of color, and the five millions of Southern whites, who would rejoice in the abolition of slavery, but the twenty millions of free people at the North also?
There is an 'irrepressible conflict,' not between the North and the South, but between slavery and freedom. Maine has unfurled her banner to the breeze, and declared in favor of personal liberty. If a fugitive slave shall be arrested there, the attorney of the State is to defend him, and the expenses of the trial to be taken from the State exchequer. The State and county jails and prisons forbidden to be used as slave-pens; all officers are forbidden, under severe penalties, to aid in the arrest of fugitive slaves. A slaveholder, making an unlawful arrest of a slave, is liable to fire years' imprisonment, or a fine of one thousand dollars.
If a slaveholder takes his chattel into that State, that chattel instantly towers into a man-and the master is punished if he attempts to restrain this sudden growth into manhood.
New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts too, that grand old eagle nest of liberty, and most of the middle and western States, have made similar laws. Shall New York be less humane and patriotic than her sister States? The testimony of these States favors the justice and <illegible> of the principles of this bill,
This act will lift a shield between the tyrant and the oppressed. It is right, because it respects the attributes of-man, and defends him in the proper exercise of his manhood. It is patriotic, because it wipes from our State the stigma which marks the execution of the Fugitive Slave Code, and lifts our Commonwealth to the lofty position to which her heroism, her intelligence and her self-<illegible> devotion to freedom entitle her. It is humane, be
<c06>
cause it breaks the yoke, shivers the chain, and, raises humanity from the dust to the Deity-like the Good Samaritan, it finds the slave robbed and bleeding on the highway of human life, and lifts him from the ditch-washes the crusted blood from the piteous and gaping wounds, and stands him on his feet, and stands by his side to shield him, and share the blow that may be raised upon him. It is scriptural, because it comports with the golden rule: 'Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them.'
'Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee; he shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he shall choose, in one of thy gates where it liketh him best; thou shalt not oppress him.'
A majority of the people of this State desire the passage of this measure, and if we do not pass it, they will send men here who will.
I suppose our democratic friends, many of whom I personally esteem, and many of whom are far better than their politics would indicate, will, of course, on this question air their patriotic devotion to the Administration, by crossing over to Virginia, by the way of Harper's Ferry; they will shudder at the ghost of John Brown, and repeat and false accusation that he was a Republican, and that his raid was a part of a scheme got up by Republicans, for the purpose of emancipating the slaves; but this has been a farce upon which the world has smiled. Indeed, the Democratic party, like the lion of Munchausen, swallowed the horse as soon as it found itself in the harness, dragging the chariot. It seems bent on committing suicide on the same scaffold on which Brown was executed, and will die, doubtless, with these words upon its lips: 'Dulciet decorum est pro portria mori.'
Am I asked what I think of John Brown? I do not hesitate to pronounce him a great and good man, with a strong head and a brave heart; but stung to madness by the insults and injuries heaped upon him by the minions of slavery in Kansas.
Giving this answer, I do not implicate any party or any person save myself. For it is will known, here and elsewhere, that the Republican party does not, and never did intend to, interfere with slavery where it exists under the sanction of State law. But it is the design of that party to exert its best efforts, by the use of laudable and constitutional means, to prevent the extension of slavery into States and territories that are now free, and these efforts have stirred up the 'irrepressible conflict' of opinion on this great question. This conflict will not cease until freedom obtains a triumphant victory. It cannot be kept down by bludgeons in the hands of Brooks and Edmondson: cannot be crushed by blows on the heads of Sumner and Hickman. Every such blow struck by ruffian representatives, strikes the people who are represented by those eloquent and able defenders of freedom, who are assaulted at the capitol. The people will take care of this great question of human liberty.
Slavery is a leech upon the public purse and the vitals of the nation.
It threatens to sap the foundations of our government, and subvert our free institutions. It ventures into our free States, and demands us to catch its fugitives. It insults the United States Commissioners, by offering a double fee when they convict a man of having made an attempt to secure the right with which God has crowned him. It degrades and imbrutes man and woman, offering them for sale like cattle in the market. The hammer of the auctioneer strikes upon the breast, and knocks down humanity to the level of the beast. It destroys the sense of moral obligation, and chills the best emotions of our better nature. It makes the negro dishonest, theft being taught him by his master who steals him, and all his earnings. It destroys all patriotic and social ties. It builds a wall of darkness around his soul, and abuts out the light of reason, and the Bible which he is not allowed to read, and he gropes through life a heathen under the shadow of the church.
It compels his wife to yield to the wish of his master, and his child to be seized by the sheriff, and sold to pay his master's debts.
I hesitate not to pronounce it as unmitigated evil.
No wonder it has split the church asunder. No wonder it has drawn such a dark political line between the North and the South.
We do not want even the shadow of this accursed thing to fall upon our fair State, and therefore ask for the passage of this bill, for the protection of the whites, as well as the blacks.
Others may do as they please: for my part, I have determined the auction-block shall not be my platform-the slave pen shall not fence in my sphere of freedom-the crack of the slave-driver's s whip will not deter me in the path of duty-the cuckoo cry of dissolution shall not drive me into humiliating concessions to slavery.
Let us unfurl the flag of personal liberty here at the Capitol, and fling its stars to the free winds, so that it shall wave in triumph from our walls.

THE ARREST OF F. B. SANBORN.
The arrest of F. B. Sanborn at Concord has very naturally excited the people of this Commonwealth, and by the manner in which it was attempted has made the whole State, without distinction of party, indignant. Nobody, or very few persons, will deny the right of Congress to compel the attendance of witnesses; and if the government should proceed properly to summon or enforce their summons, the people of Massachusetts would not be found hostile to just demands; but the Senate of the United States is as much bound to respect the law<illegible> as any John Browns or their abettors; and when they do not, the Supreme Court of the State will not be forgetful of duties, and the legislature should not be backward to protect the rights of any citizen. But beyond simple obedience to laws, the Senate is bound to proceed courteously and respectfully. There are proper times and ways for action that should govern the strong as well as the weak. Mr. Sanborn had not fled the country; he was not a dangerous man to arrest at noon-day, and with no unusual force. For the great Senate of the United States, on a warrant signed by the Vice President of the nation. to seek a private individual by decoy letters, to seize him under the cover of darkness, and attempt to rush him from his home in irons, partially undressed-having neither hat nor boots on-and allowing him no time to consult friends or legal advisers, is mean, cowardly, dastardly, despotic conduct, that will bring down the honest curses of every decent man in the nation; it is part of the same weak ness and cowardly inhumanity that characterized Virginia as her trial and execution of John Brown and his accomplices. The arrest of Sanborn, under the circumstances, by bullies and brutal, men, is a partial to the usurpation of Louis Napoleon, when the soldiers were intoxicated, and sent at midnight to arrest the patriots of France, who were hurried to prisons and exile. We have no sympathy with men who resist rightful and legal authority; but in dealing with any one, the government should shield itself under at least the seeming of decency, and that they did not at Concord on Wednesday.
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
The United States Constitution is 'a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell."
The free states are the guardians and <illegible> supports of slavery. We are the jailers and constables of the institution.... There is some excuse for communities, when, under a generous impulse, they espouse the cause of the oppressed in other States, and by force restore their rights; but they are without excuse in aiding other States in binding on men on unrighteous yoke. On this subject, OUR FATHERS, IN FRAMING THE CONSTITUTION, SWERVED FROM THE RIGHT. We their children, at the end of half a century, see the path of duty more clearly than they, and must walk in it. To this point the public mind has long been tending, and the time has come for looking at it fully, dispassionately, and with manly and Christian resolution.... No blessing of the union can be a compensation for taking part in the enslaving of our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to be perpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that it can only continue through our participation in wrong doing. To this conviction the free States are tending.'-WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING.

The United States Senate, like any individual or body of men, is not only bound to keep within the law, and to have its officers or agents with common decency, but they ought, also, to obtain popular approval, to show no partiality. We would not justify Sanborn in refusing attendance before not the committee, provided they guarantee his safe return to Massachusetts; nor Hyatt in refusing to answer questions, provided he could do it without criminating himself, and surely no man should be obliged to swear the halter upon his own neck ; but it Sanborn must be seized in the night, and ironed, and dragged away from home, and Hyatt must be thrust into jail, people this way would very well like to know why Henry A. Wise has not given his testimony?-and when he says-,I know, but will not divulge'-why is he not in jail, too? The committee should that their action is not persecution
MEMORIAL OF F.B.SANBORN TO THE
SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
To the Honorable the senate of the United states:
 Respectfully represents F.B. Sanborn, of Concord, Mass., that while he, as he believes, has rightly refused to obey the summons of the� Select Committee' of the Senate, and has desired in a legal and a proper manner to contest his rights as a citizen, of which he has before this informed the senate, by his memorial of Feb.I6,I860,submitted to them on the 27th of Feb.,I860,other persons, claiming to act under the authority of the senate, have unwarrantably usurped power and disgraced themselves by their acts and doings; that on the night of the 3d of April, instant, between the hours of nine and ten o'clock, P.M., was called to the door of his own house by a young man who handed him a fraudulent letter, and that while in the act of taking this, he was seized by another man; that to his often repeated demands for the names and authority of these men, he could get no sufficient or definite answer; and that in refusing to go with them unless he could see the precept under which they are acting, or know its nature of contents, he was held and handcuffed, and then without hat or shoes was dragged by these men, and three others who had been called by a whistle from them, from his house into the road, and there violently pushed, lifted and shoved to and upon ;that by great efforts on his own part, assisted by those of his sister, he succeeded in preventing these men from placing him in the carriage, and the alarm being given to his friends and neighbors, he was soon surrounded by them,  demands of himself and others, the ruffians finally gave , Freeman,-Tartan,-Coolidge and-Foss, and for their authority read a precept to be directed to Dunning R. McNair, Sergeant-at-Arms of the U.S., commanding the arrest and bringing before the senate by the said McNair of the body of your memorialize; that no person named McNair appeared to arrest him, but which the said McNair professed to depute his authority to Silas Carlton, and to no other ; and that none of the man holding him were known to your memorialize, or to any of his neighbors then present, and had no badge of authority or indications of their being officers ;that upon the arrival of your memorialists's counsel, who had been sent for, they refused to take him back into the house, there to remain until a writ Habeas Corpus could be, but continued to hold him in the condition in which he was, without hat or shoes, in the cold night air and upon the damp ground for an hour or thereabouts; and that when a writ of Habeas Corpus, issued by a Justice of the Supreme Judicial court of this Commonwealth, had been brought and duly served on them by a Deputy Sheriff of the county, they refused to obey the command, and compelled the officer to use force and the power of� posse cogitates' to take your memorialize out of their hands to the great risk of his life and limb, and the serious injury of his arms and wrists, which were still manacled ; that all this was done by the said Carlton and the others named upon a precept which appears to have been in their hands time your memorialize has been openly engaged in his usual avocations, and about the town in which he resides, freely and without any disguise or concealment, and that there was no sort of reason or excuse for the secrecy, fraud, violence and ruffianism used in making the arrest; and that since his discharge by the full bench of the Supreme Judicial Court, for want of authority in said Carlton to make such an arrest after a full hearing of the case, he finds that said Carlton and those employed by him are men having no property or responsibility, holding no official position, and possessing no such character as that they ought to be entrusted with the most delicate and dangerous power of arresting and forcibly carrying away free citizens ; that their manner of exercising it was so improper ; disgraceful and offensive, that it has lowered the dignity of your precept, and tended to impair the proper authority of your honorable body in the eyes of all good citizens, without distinction of party, sect or belief; and further, that your memorialist conceives his own rights to have been grievously outraged, and prays redress of your honorable body. And as in duty bound will ever pray. F.B.SANBORN

DR.ROCK'S LECTURE
Last Friday evening, we heard a lecture in the Hal of the House of Representatives, which was very interesting in every respect: I. On account of the place and the assembly.2.On account of the subject, Woman, the intellectual equal of man, as illustrated in the character and writings of Madame de Sttael.3.On account of its practicability. 4 On account of the person of the lecturer, who, think ye democratic editors, was a darkly, a woolly-headed negro! And this negro is even a Doctor, viz., Dr. Rock, and this African Dr. Rock speaks and writes even German!
The choice of the theme shows the intelligence of the lecturer. Dr. Rock has undertaken to compare the most celebrated (and next to G. Sand, the greatest) authoress of the world, -with the most renowned and greatest of all the enemies of the emancipation of woman-Napoleon. She proved herself to be not only his equal, but his intellectual superior. On this account he faced her more than he did a legion of men, which is but too clearly proved not only by his persecution of her person, but of her writings. The lecturer explained how Napoleon caused the suppression of her great work on Germany, and to prevent a single copy from escaping and being read, he caused the whole edition it be destroyed-had the printer's establishment guarded by troops, and demanded from her every sheet of her manuscript. A single copy being saved, made it possible for her to get it published in England
The mightiest ruler of the world trembling before the pen of a woman! Is this not the best illustration of the intellectual equality of woman? Dr. Rock was right in saying that one such woman is a complete vindication of toe whole sex! 
What we liked exceedingly in the speaker was his ability to appreciate the explanations of Steal in regard to the intellectual life of Germany. Her book, notwithstanding its faults, has done more than any other work to unfold the spiritual life of Germany, to abolish the prejudices which have existed in foreign countries against the Germans. Her praise of Germany offended Napoleon, the Tyrant, and on this account it was thought that the publication of her book might peril the duration of the sacred Empire. In his criticism of this work. Dr. Rock proved himself as learned in the Gorman as be is in French literature. 
Thus, a thinking, educated, German, and French speaking negro, converses and instructs a select American andience on female intelligence and literature of the past times, is the Hal! of the House of Representatives of one of the first States in the Union! What is to become of such? Do you know of a preventive? Democratic Editors, where are your fists? For with your heads you cannot come, for the woolly head of Dr. Rock contains more science, intellect and intelligence, than all your pumpkins put together

THE SLAVERY QUESTION
SPEECH
OF
HON.OWN LOVEJOY,
OF ILLINORS,
I n the House of Representatives, April5, 1860
The House being in Committee of the Whole, on the State of the Union,
Mr. LOVEJOY said:
Mr. Chairman�The House has been occupied for several days in the discussion of the subject of polygamy. The Republican party, of which I am a member, stands pledged, sinceI856, to the extermination, so far as the Federal Government has the power, of the twin relics of barbarism, slavery and polygamy. They have this power in the Territories of the United States
Now, sir, as we anticipate a death-blow has been given to one of these twins, I propose to pay my respects to the other. I want to see them both strangled and go down together, as they both richly deserve
I am aware that the practical question presented to this House and to the country, is, whether slavery shall be extended beyond in present limits; as that, is the only question over which they have exclusive jurisdiction. And if slavery were contented to remain restricted, and find its future where it now is, we might perhaps forbear this discussion. But when it is proposed to extend what is termed an institution�but which is not an institution; which is simply a practice�the question naturally ;arises, what is the nature, what are the influences, and what are the elements of this practice? and what will they prove to be, if allowed expansion?
I am aware it has been stated upon this floor that the morale of slavery is settled; that its ethics are no longer to be discussed; that they were settled ages ago by the Stagy rite of Greece, and have been reaffirmed and re-established by the chanticleer' Solon of Ohio, in rhetoric gorgeous as sunset's glow. We are told that where slavery will pay, slaveholding will go; Precisely upon the same principle we might say that where robbery will pay, robbery will go; where piracy will pay, piracy will go; and where adipose human flesh is cheaper than that of beeves, cannibalism will go, because it will pay. Sir, than robbery, than piracy, than polygamy, slaveholding is worse more criminal, more injurious to man, and consequently more offensive to God
Slaveholding has been justly designated as the sum of all villainy. Put every crime perpetrated among men into a moral crucible, and dissolve and combine them all, and the resultant amalgam is slaveholding. It has the violence of robbery.
A Member�You are joking.
Mr. Lovejoy�No, sir; I am speaking in dead earnest, before God, God's own truth. It has the violence of robbery, the blood and cruelty of piracy; it has the offensive and brutal lusts of polygamy. all combined and concentrated in itself, with aggravations that neither one of these crimes ever knew or dreamed of
Now, Mr. Chairman, the justification of slavery is placed, so far as I know, mainly upon these grounds: the inferiority of the enslaved race; the fact that enslaving men imparts Christianity and civilization to them; and, thirdly, the guarantees of the Constitution. These are the three main arguments presented to justify slavery, and consequently to justify its expansion. And, by the way, I hold that the extreme men, as they are called, on this question, are the only men who have the logic of it. I am right, or the fire-eaters are right. If slavery is right in Virginia, it is right in Kansas. If it is wrong in Kansas, it is wrong everywhere
Now, sir, in regard to the first point�the inferiority of the enslaved race. We may concede it as a matter of fact that it inferior: but does it follow, therefore, that it is right to enslave a man simply because he is inferior? This, to me, is a most abhorrent doctrine. It would place the weak everywhere at the mercy of the strong; it would place the poor at the mercy of the rich; it would place those who are deficient in intellect at the mercy of those that are gifted in mental endowment
The principle of enslaving human beings because they are inferior is this: If a man is a cripple, trip him up; if he is old and weak, and bowed with the weight of years, strike him, for he cannot strike back; if idiotic, take advantage of him; and if a child, deceive him. This, sir, is the doctrine of Democrats, and the doctrine of devils as well, and there is no place in the universe outside the five points of hell and the Democratic party where the practice and prevalence of such doctrines would not be a disgrace.(Laughter.) If the strong of the earth are to. enslave the weak here, it would justify angels in enslaving them, because they are superior; and archangels in turn would be justified in subjugating those who are inferior in intellect and position, and ultimately it would transform Jehovah into an infinite Juggernaut, rolling the huge wheels of his omnipotence-
[Mr. Lovejoy here advanced into the area, and occupied the space fronting the Democratic benches Mr. Pryor, of Virginia, came menacingly toward him, exclaiming,� The gentleman from Illinois shall not approach this side of the House, shaking hi*fists, and talking in the way he has talked'�&c. Great excitement followed, with frequent interruptions of the speaker, as narrated last week. Finally]�
Mr. Lovejoy (taking his place in the Clerk's desk)resumed. Mr. Chairman, I was about stating, when interrupted, that the principle upon which slaveholding was sought to be justified in this country would, if carried out in the affairs of the universe, transform Jehovah, the Supreme, into an infinite Juggernaut, rolling the huge wheels of his omnipotence, ankle-deep, amid the crushed, and mangled, and bleeding bodies of human beings, (laughter on the Democratic aide.) on the ground that he was infinitely superior, and that they were an inferior race
Mr. Farrell, (in his seat) The man is crazy
Mr. Lovejoy�The second ground upon which it is attempted to justify slavery, or slaveholding, is, that it is a mode of imparting Christianity and civilization to the slaves, Mr. Chairman, I would like to know how slaveholding communities can impart that of which they are not in the possession? The truth is, that the practice of slaveholding has a powerful tendency to drag communities back to barbarism. It is actually having that effect upon the slave States of this Union; and were it not for the Christian women that have gone from the free States, and intermarried in the slave States; and were it not for those noble women of the States, that preserve womanly purity and Christianity, in spite of the unhappy influences of slaveholding, the slave States to-day would be as far back in barbarism as the State of Mexico. It is simply from that infiltration��
Mr. Singleton�I wish to know if the gentleman intends to cast any insinuation or slur on the women of the South. I want to know that distinctly and emphatically; because if he does, I will hold him personally accountable for it
Several Members�Oh, an; he gives all praise to the woman of the South; he compliments them
Mr. Singleton�I repeat that, if he intended to asperse Southern women, or to compliment the women of the North at their expense, I will hold him accountable for it
The Chairman -The gentleman from Mississippi is not in order. The gentleman from Illinois will proceed
Mr. Lovejoy�It is simply by this contact with from communities�it is, as I said, from the fact that Christian women went from free States, and that the Christian woman of slave States�who have not the poor privilege that Sarah of old had, of sending the Hangars and Ishmaels to the wilderness-maintained
<C03>
their purity and Christian character, and their testimony against the system, that they were prevented from that retrocession toward barbarism
Several Members�That is what he said before
Mr. Lovejoy�Sir, if you step into the Smithsonian Institute, or into the Patent Office, you will find <illegible> of husbandry imported from Japan and china, showing just about the same development in civilization as the implements that you find on the taxations. Now, Sir, the truth is, that the practice at slaveholding drugs slaveholding communities further below the plans of the Christian civilization of the age, than the civilization which the slave receives elevates him above the plane of heathenism, y being held in these Christian communities. Sir, how do they impart civilization and Christianity? It is a strange mode of christianising a race, to torn hem over into brutish without any legal marriage. Among the four million slaves in this country, there s not a single husband or wife. There is not, leally, a single father or child. There is not a single home or hearthstone among these four millions. And you propose to civilize and christianize a people with-out giving them homes, without allowing them the conjugal and parental relations, and without having those relations sanctioned and protected by law
Mr. Chairman, no community can make one step of progress in civilizing a race till you give them Homes; till you protect the sanctity of the home, as we hold it should be protected in regard to these Mormons on the plaint of Utah. Christianizing them, sir! Christianizing them by a new process. The slave States have a tight to an exclusive patent for it. Taking them out in the sight of the church, as one was taken out not long ago in the State of Tennessee, by a Presbyterian elder, and laid down on his face on the ground, his bands and feet extended to their utmost tension, and tied to pickets, and the gospel whipped into him with the broad side of a handsaw, discolored whelks of sanctification being raised between the teeth every time this gospel agency fell upon the naked and quivering flesh of the tortured convert. (Laughter)
A Democratic member�Did he get the gospel in? (Laughter)
Mr. Lovejoy�Christianized as a young girl was Christianized in this city since the session of Congress, by being whipped and sent to the garret, and found dead in the morning, with blood oozing from nose and cars
A Democratic member�Where does that authority come from?
Mr. Lovejoy�I do not know whether religious rites were had or not. I suppose some pro-slavery priest was invited in to utter prayers before God that the last flagellation might have whipped in Christianity enough to save her precious and never-dying soul. (Laughter) And now, alarmed, a good black walnut coffin is made and decorated with white ribbons, and placed in the hearse, followed by a hack containing, I presume, the murderess; and my attention is called to the cortege: �See, Mr. Lovejoy, there is a slave funeral! Is that treating them like brutes? Look into the coffin! Look into the carriage!!' You say this is horrid. I know it is horrid. I know it is horrid to hold men in slavery. I know it is horrid to doom four million human beings to the condition of chattels, to be held pro midis, pro mortis, pro quadruped bus, taken for no persons, for dead persons, for four-footed beasts�men as much entitled to freedom as you and I. Sir, the testimony of all religious societies in the slave States is that the slaves are still heathen, and it is an utter impossibility to Christianize them and civilize them by this process
The third point that is relied on to justify slaveholding is, that it is constitutional�that it is guarantied by the Constitution of the United States. Now, Mr. Chairman, I have heard it declared, over and over again, that the Constitution guaranties slavery. I deny it. In no article, in no section, in no line, in no word, in no syllable, can there be any recognition or sanction of human slavery found in the Constitution of the United States. It is not there. It always recognizes human beings as persons, and never as property. It does not use the word� slave' or� slavery.' Why, sir, when I came up to take the oath to support the Constitution, a whispered buzz, half in earnest and half jocular, passed around:� How can Lovejoy swear to support the Constitution? How can he take the oath?' I could take the oath to support the Constitution, because I believe in the Constitution, because I hold to it, because my heart is loyal to it. Every part, and parcel, and portion of it, I believe in ; but I do not believe in the construction put upon it by those who claim its recognition and sanction of the practice of slaveholding
Mr. Barksdale�No, sir; you stand there to-day an infamous, perjured villain. (Calls to order.)
Mr. Ashmore�Yes, he is a perjured villain; and he perjures himself every hour he occupies a seat on this floor. (Renewed calls to order.)
Mr. Singleton�And a negro thief into the bargain.
Mr. Lovejoy�I swore to support the Constitution because I believe in it. I do not believe in their construction of it. It is as well known as any historical fact can be known, that the framers of the Constitution so worded it that it never should recognize the idea of slave property, from the beginning to the ending of it. But the advocates of slavery have affirmed a strange doctrine in regard to the Constitution. They think that because I swore to support the Constitution, I swore to support the practice of slaveholding. Sir, slaveholding in Virginia is no more under the control or guarantee of the Constitution than slavery in Cuba, or Brazil, or any other part of the world, is under the control or guarantee of the Constitution�not one particle
Mr. McClernand�I wish to ask the gentleman whether be has always held that the Constitution deserved to be sustained and accepted�whether, at any time in his life, he held that the Constitution ought to be trodden under foot?
Mr. Lovejoy�Never, sir; never. I always defended it, and always will, whether it be against the Democrats who pervert it, or the disunionists who trample on it. 
Mr. McClernand�If the gentleman says he never said so, I am not prepared to contradict him, for I know nothing, personally, about it; but I had understood that the gentleman once uttered this language: that the Constitution was a piece of rotten parchment that ought to be trodden under foot.�
Mr. Lovejoy�Yes; that was thrown in my face once before here, and I denied it. It never had the least foundation in truth. I always defended the Constitution, because it was for liberty. It was ordained by the people of the United States, not by a superannuated old mummy of a judge�and a Jesuit at that�but by the people of the United States, to establish justice, secure the blessings of liberty for themselves and their posterity, and to secure the natural rights of every human being within to exclusive jurisdiction. Therefore I love it.
These men can perceive nothing in the Constitution but slavery. A young man leads a blushing bride to the altar, and takes the marital vow before God and attendant witnesses to love, cherish, and protect her. There she stands�the divinest thing that God has fashioned and pleased upon earth�radiant in the beauty of youth; her cheek glowing with the color of the rose, which expands and fades away into that of the lily; her eyes sparkling like the stars from the depths of blue, and her tresses falling around her neck like the locks of the morning. Is the mole on that fair round neck, or the wart on that plump, soft hand, THE WOMAN whom the bridegroom swore to love and cherish? Say, sir, is it? So there is the Constitution�instinct with freedom, radiant with the principles of universal liberty, seizing the inspired utterances of our Magna Chart a, and reducing them to practical and organic realization. Now, sir, I insist that if the clauses that an deemed to refer to the
<CO4>
subject of slavery mean all that the wildest enthusiast claims them to mean, they bear no other relation or proportion to the Constitution which I swear to the support, than the excrescence on the band or neck pt toes to the woman whom the bridegroom vowed to love and cherish. He loves her not for these things, but in spite of them.
So I love the Constitution, not in consequence of these things. which are alleged to be in it, but in spite of them. But you will say, the woman had right to sport as excrescence on bar hand, if she chose I concede it; and us a Federal law-maker, I concede that the States have a right to sport this fungus of slavery, because it is beyond my reach, But time rolls away. This youthful pair have years of middle age upon them. Olive plants have sprung it up around the parent stem. The woman has gone mad. She gloats over the excrescence which hat spread and coven her entire hand. She exclaims,� Husband, this is a dear, sweet darling of a wart, and I want to engraft it on the hands of all our daughters. I had it when I was married; you vowed to protect me, and I claim the right to transfer it to ii all the children. If you do not, I will go to Indiana, and get a divorce. I will dissolve the union between,' The husband, calm and firm, replies, My dear, a I haw indulged you in this whim about your hand, because I took you for better or for worse, sad I ii thought it was one of your individual rights, which I h was not at liberty to disturb. But if you propose to transfer this deformity to the daughters, I say distinctly and decidedly, it cannot be done. This is my a prerogative, and I must exercise it.' So I say to the A slavery propagandists who desire to transplant slavery to the Territories, and thus fasten it upon he daughters of the Republic, My dears, it cannot be done.'
I say, therefore, Mr. Chairman, that there is no justification for this practice of slaveholding, from the fact that the enslaved race are an inferior race, c No justification from the pretended fact that it imparts Christianity and civilization to them; and none t in the guarantees of the Constitution. Now, there are some Christian men on the other side of the I House; I want to pat it to them, in all candor�for while I intend to speak of slaveholding with as severe terms of reprobation as I possibly can, I do not intend to offend any person individually�I want to know of you, Christian gentlemen, how you are going to- Christianize men when you do not give them homes. 
A Member�Give them what?
Mr. Lovejoy�Homes: a legal sanction to the conjugal and parental relations. How are you going to� Christianize men whom you turn out to herd together I like the buffaloes that roam upon the western prairies?
You cannot do it
It may be asked, sir, when I confess that I have no control over this matter, why discuss it? why talk about it?
Mr. Singleton�I want to know if the gentleman gives homes-
Mr. Lovejoy�I must decline to yield to the gentleman.
Mr. Singleton�I want to answer the gentleman's question by asking him another. I want to know if he gives homes to the negroes he carries from the South to Canada and other places?
A Member�The negro he steals?
The Chairman�The gentleman from Mississippi is not in order.
Mr. Barksdale�I hope my colleague will hold no parley with that perjured negro-thief.
Mr. Lovejoy�It is asked, why discuss this question? Why talk about it, when it is confessed that we have no constitutional power to legislate upon it? I will tell you, Mr. Chairman. It will be recollected that Mr. Webster once said, when speaking of the threatened interposition of Russia to snatch Kossuth from the protection of Turkey, for the purpose of' sacrificing him on the altar of despotism: Gentle-men, there is something on earth greater than arbitrary or despotic power. The lightning has its power, and the whirlwind has its power, and the earthquake� has its power; but there is something among men j more capable of shaking despotic thrones than lightning, whirlwind or earthquake; and that is the excited and aroused indignation of the whole civilized world.'
The Avon to the Severn runs;
The Severn to the sea;
And Wickliffe's dust shall spread abroad
Wide as the waters be'
To continue the quotation with a different application and a alight variation of the language, I say, gentlemen, if the blood of innocent men is taken by an absolute, unqualified, unjustifiable violation of natural law, what will it appease, what will it pacify? It will mingle with the earth; it will mix with the waters of the ocean; the whole civilized world will snuff it in the air; and it will return with awful retribution on the heads of those violators of natural. law and universal justice. I cannot say when, or in what form; but depend upon it, if such acts take place, then slavery most look out for the consequences.
Sir, before the public sentiment of the Christian and civilized world, I propose to hold op to universal reprobation this practice of slaveholding. I propose to hold it up in all its atrocity, in all its hideousness, just as gentlemen have been holding up the practice of polygamy, and reprobating it; and, sir, that public sentiment of the civilized world will barn upon this practice of slavery, and ultimately secure its removal in the only proper way�by the action of the slave States themselves. This is why I discuss it.
Mr. Chairman, my time is passing away, and I must hasten on. I want to come to a few things that have been under discussion during the inchoate condition of the House, whilst this Hall was echoing with ululations that would have drowned the lupine chorus of the Alps, of Helper, and John Brown, and incendiaries, the torch of the incendiary, and the knife of the assassin. One gentleman from Virginia stood up in his place, and wanted to know when then was a man who would endorse the Helper book. He wanted such a man, if there was one here, to stand up, that he might look upon the traitor. Mr. Chairman, I, for one, signed the paper recommending the circulation of the Helper book. I signed it intelligently. I was neither engrossed nor abstracted. I did it because I wanted to do it; and now, if the gentleman wants to look upon that kind of a traitor, me, me, adsum, gui feci, in me convertite tetum ; I did it. I will sign a recommendation for the circulation of any book that I choose, without asking permission of the gentleman from Missouri, (Mr. Clark,) or of any other gentleman an in the House or out of the House. I will sign a paper recommending the circulation of the Bible or the Koran, Young's Night Thoughts or Tom Moon's Anacreon, Jonathan Edwards on the Decrees, or Tom Paine's Age of Reason, just as I please.
I claim the privilege, as an American citizen, of writing my name and recommending the circulation of any and every book, without being held amenable to gentlemen upon this floor, or say when else. That is my answer in regard to it. I have more than that to say. I say nothing about some points is the book. I have no doubt that then is considerable bombast and fustian sad violence of language is it, because the author was educated is a slave Slate, and the rhetoric which comes from that quarter is apt to have these characteristics. (Laughter.) Bat the philosopy�the gist of the book�is what? It is the address of a citizen of a slave State to his fellow-citizens is regard to the subject of slavery, recommending in substance the organization of a Republican party in North Carolina and in all the other slave Sates. I hope to see that done; and I expect to see it done before very long. You may kill Cassias M. Clay, as you threaten to do; but� the blood of the martyrs is the and of the church.' You may shed
<C05>
his blood, as you shed the blood of my brother on the banks of the Mississippi, twenty years ago�and what then? I am here to-day, thank God, to vindicate the principles baptized in his blood. You may shed his blood�and what then? A Republican party will spring up in Kentucky, and in all the slave States are long; and these disunionists and gentlemen whom you see so violent, now, will be displaced by more moderate, and�if I may say so without being, offensive�more sensible men.
I believe in that doctrine. I do act endorse every expression; but the Helper book, for I have not studied every expression; but the philosophy of the book, the idea of organizing a party in the slave States as against slavery, I am in favor of, and I expect to see it accomplished. What is the objection to the book? The objection is that a citizen of the United States, an American citizen, addressed himself to his fallow citizens, in a peaceful way, through the press; and for this you find fault with him, and say that he must be hanged, and that any man who signed a recommendation for the circulation of his book is a� biting, blasting, burning, withering curse,' and must not occupy that chair.
 I want to know if it has come to this? Has not an American citizen a right to speak to an American citizen? I want the right of uttering what I say here in Richmond. I claim the right to say what I say here in Charleston.
Mr. Bonham� You had better try it
Mr. Lovejoy �Yes, sir, I am going to invoke the aid of the General Government to protect me, as an American citizen, in my rights as an American citizen. I can go to England to-day, and in London, or anywhere else, discuss the question of Church and State; I can discuss the question of a monarchical government as compared with a Republican form of government. I can do this any when in England, but I cannot go into a slave State, and open my lips in regard to the question of slavery�
Mr. Martin, of Virginia�No; we would hang you higher than Haman
Mr. Lovejoy�I cannot go to a slave State, and utter my sentiments to free citizens like myself.
Mr. Miles�Can you go to England, and incite the laboring classes to murder the aristocracy, or to assassinate the Queen?
Mr. Lovejoy�I have no desire to, nor have I any desire to incite such things any where else; but I do claim the right of discussing this question of slavery my when, on any square foot of American soil over which the stars and stripes float, and to which the privileges and immunities of the Constitution extend Under that Constitution, which guaranties to me free speech, I claim it and demand it
Mr. Bonham�I ask the gentleman why he does not attempt to assert this right?
Mr. Lovejoy�Yes, sir. The gentleman comes from a slave State, in which they are in the habit of speaking of the laboring classes in the Northern States as �greasy mechanics,' �filthy operatives, 'small-fisted farmers,' and they jeer at us worse than the slaves. This insulting language can be, and is, used in the free States without molestation or injury. Yet they say,' If you come here and utter the sentiments which you sincerely believe, we will hang you.
If a mechanic from a free State goes there, and utters the sentiment that he thinks, if they had more white laborers and fewer black ones, that labor in the South would be more respectable, what do you do with him? Denude him, scourge him, and, to intensify the indignity, you drive the knotted thong, by the hand of a slave, deep in his quivering flesh ; than tar and feather him; and then put him on the ears, still naked, to be sent a long distance, and threaten with violence the man who has the compassion to give him a cup of coffee. And, finally, after being jeered at every station along the route, the victim of your cruelty, a free citizen, crawls into a stable and begs, stealthily begs, the cast-off clothes of an hostler to hide his nakedness. You drive away young ladies that go to teach school; imprison or exile preachers of the Gospel; and pay your debts by raising the mad-dog cry of abolition against the agents of your creditors
Mr. Barksdale�The meanest slave in the South is your superior.(Cries of� Order!' from the Republican side.)
Mr. Martin, of Virginia. I hope gentlemen from the South will let him talk as he pleases, but go away and not listen to him.
A member on the Republican side�Well, go!� Stand not on the order of your going, but go at once.
Mr. Lovejoy�Mr. Chairman, I claim the privilege of going any when and every when within the limits of this American Republic, as a free citizen, unmolested, and of uttering, in an orderly and legal way, any sentiment that I choose to utter; and yet, are we allowed to do it? Are we for that, in these United States, to be subjected to violence, outrage, tar and feathers, burning, imprisonment, and the gallows? Answer that question. I know gentlemen say that self-preservation is the first law of nature; but if you cannot keep slavery and allow free discussion, then I say, in God's name, before free discussion and all the rights of free citizens are to be sacrificed to that Moloch of Slavery, that Moloch most be immolated at the shrine of Liberty, free speech, free discussion, and all those rights that cluster around an American citizen.
Why, Mr. Chairman, a citizen of Rome, when the scourge was already upraised and about to fall upon him, if he uttered the cry,� I am a Roman citizen,' it arrested the scourge. Well, sir, is not there more of a charm, is it not a prouder position to be an American than to be a Roman citizen? And are we, in the nineteenth century, living under this Constitution, with our free institutions�an our persons and our rights to be less sacred than they were under the old Roman administration, eighteen centuries ago, and more? That is my response to the question why I recommended the circulation of the Helper book
Now, what about John Brown? (Cries of� Let's have it!') This affair of John Brown brings us to the reality of things. This raid confronts as with slavery, and makes as ask. Is slaveholding right? and if so, what rights has it? When the curtain rose and startled the nation with this tragedy, John Brown lay then like a wounded lion with his head upon his paws, a sabre out on his brow, bayonet gashes in his side, the blood oozing out, and life itself apparently ebbing fast. Around were certain little specimens of the canine species, snuffing and smelling, and finally one of them yelped out�' Mr. Lion, was the old war-horse that pastured on the Western Reserve with you on this expedition?' The lion slowly raised his head, east a disdainful side glance upon the inquirer, growled out a contemptuous negative, and reposed his head as before.
In regard to John Brown, you want me to curse him. I will not curse John Brown. You want me to pour out execrations upon the head of old Osawatomie. Though all the slaveholding Balaks in the country fill their houses with silver and proffer it, I will not curse John Brown. I do honestly condemn what he did, from my stand-point, and with my convictions, I disapprove of his action, that is true ; but I believe that his purpose was a good one; that so far as his own motives before God were concerned, they were honest and truthful; and no one can deny that he stands head and shoulders above any other character that appeared on the stage in that tragedy from beginning to end ;from the time he entered the armory there to the time when he was strangled by Governor �Fussation� (General laughter.)
He was not only of murder or treason. He did unquestionably violate the statute against aiding slaves to escape; but no blood was shed, except by the panis-stricken multitude, till Stevens was fired
<CO6>
upon while waving a flag of truce. The only murder was that of Thompson, who was snatched from the heroic protection of a woman, and riddled with balls at the railroad bridge. Despotism has seldom sacrificed three nobler victims than Brown, Stevens and Hazlitt
As I remarked, Mr. Chairman, this brings us to confront slavery, and ask what right this Caliban has upon earth? I say no right. My honest conviction and I do not know why gentlemen need take offence; they need not unless they choose�my honest conviction is, that all these slaveholding laws have the same moral power and force that rules among pirates have for the distribution of their booty; that regulations among robbers have for the division of their spoils; and, although I do not think gentlemen have behaved very handsomely to me, I am going to add, notwithstanding, that I do not mean to say that gentlemen who are slaveholders would be guilty of these particular things�that is not the point�I am talking about this matter in the court of conscience, in the court of right and wrong; and I inside that any laws for enslaving men have just the same moral force as the arrangement among robbers and pirates for distributing their spoils.
I want to know by what right you can come and make me a slave? I want to know by what right you can say that my child shall be your slave? I want to know by what right you say that the mother shall not have her child, given her from God through the martyrdom of maternity? Hear that soft, exquisite warble of a love:
�Ere last year's sun had left the sky,
A birdling sought my Indian nest,
And folded, ah! so lovingly,
Its tiny wings upon my breast.'
 Now, where is the wretch who would dare to go up and take that fluttering and panting birdling from the bosom of its mother, and say, 'It is mine; I will sell it like a calf; I will sell it like a pig'? what right had that mother to her babe? Was it because she was� Fanny Forrester,' the gifted suthoress? was it because she was the wife of a venerable and venerated missionary? No, it was because she was its MOTHER; and every slave mother has just as good a title to her babe as� Fanny Forrester' had to hers. No laws can make it right to rob her. I say in God's name, my child is mine; and yet I have no right to mine that a slave father has not to his child. Not a particle. The same argument that proves my right to my personal liberty, proves the right of every human being to his. The argument that proves my right to my children, gives the same title, the same sacred claim, to every father, They, as I, get it from their God, no human enactment can annual the claim. No sir, never! Therefore, every slave has a right to his freedom, in spite of your slave laws. Every slave has a right to run away, in spite of your slave laws
I tell you, Mr. Chairman, and I tell you all, that if I were a slave, and had I the power, and were it necessary to achieve my freedom, I would not hesitate to fill up and bridge over the chasm that yawns between the hell of slavery and the heaven of freedom with the carcasses of the slain. Give me my freedom! Hands off! Unthrottle that man! Give him his liberty. He is entitled to it from his god. With these views, I do not think, of course, it is any harm to help away a slave. I told you that a year ago; I need not repeat it
A Member�'You steal them.'
Mr. Lovejoy�Who steals when a man comes and takes a child from my hearthstone? Who <illegible> when he comes and takes the babe, flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone? Who steals? I tell you that I have no more hesitation in helping a fugitive slave than I have in snatching a lamb from the jaws of a wolf, cr disengaging an infant from the talons of eagle. Not a bit. Long enough has the nation crouched and cowered in the presence of this stupendous wrong. Here and now I break the spell, and disenchant the Republic from the incantation of this accursed sorceress. It is simply a question whether it will pay to go down into the den where the wolf is(laughter.)If you would only go into your lair, and crunch the bones and tear the flesh of your victims, we might let you alone; but you will not. You claim the right to go with this flesh in your teeth all over our Territories. We deny it
My time is passing; I must go on. I wanted to say considerable more about John Brown
Mr. Adrian�I propose that we give the gentlemen more time.
Mr. Lovejoy�I will answer all the question, if the House will give me more time.(Cries of� No! no!' �Give him time!' &c)
Mr. Singleton�No, sir; any gentleman shall have time, but not such a mean, despicable wretch as that.
Mr. Lovejoy�When the Jews could mot do anything else, they spit upon Christ, and said he was possessed of a devil (Laughter.) One of the earliest settlements of Virginia was made by a fugitive slave. John Smith was captured in war, and sold to a hightoned, chivalrous Turk, and put at the task of threshing. The master rode up to the barn-door one day and said, 'Jack you rascal, why don't you <illegible> faster?' Jack�horresco referens�flew at his master, killed him with his flail, (oh, for a Harper's Ferry committee!)sprang into the vacant saddle and escaped, and came and settled Jamestown. Oh, for a South-side preacher to admonish John to stay and serve his master, whose money he was, like a good� Christian dog!'
A moment, sir. Let us look at the question aside from its moral aspect. And I want to know what right slavery, or a slaveholder, has to go with slaves into the Territories of the United States You talk about the equality of the States, and I grant it. The citizens of a slave State have all the rights in the Territories that a citizen of a free State has. You have the right, I concede, to go into the common Territories and live there with any kind of property we can take, but you have not the right to take slaves. This is the distinction I make
At a liberal estimate, there are not more than two millions of people in the United States interested in slave labor. There are only four hundred thousand slaveholders. There are thirty millions of people in this country. There are twenty-eight millions interested in the system of free labor, and two millions in that labor. The free system accommodates some eight millions in the slave State better than the slave system. Here is the point. If slavery goes into the Territories, free labor cannot go there
The presence of slavery without any local law for the purpose is the expulsion of free labor. If you take slavery there, I cannot go there with the New York Tribune, the Evening post, Independent, or any similar paper, religious or secular. I cannot with the minister I desire to hear preach the gospel Free schools cannot go there You say, indeed, we can go Yes; so all may go to a public house It is common to all who choose to make it a temporary place of abode. All are invited to the table of house. The landlord opens the doors of the dining-room hall and says, 'Walk in, gentlemen'; but if a man sitting there is leprous, dripping with a contagious disease, no one will go in. It is really as much as exclusion as if the doors were closed and freedom cannot go. I favor the equality of the states. I favor the right of every citizen of a slave State to go into the Territories; but I deny that he has a right to practice slaveholding there, for it is not an institution�it was never instituted; never established by law�but a practice like polygamy. I say that they have no right to go there and practice this high crime, so injurious to man and so offensive to God. And this is the question; whether these twenty-eight million people shall be accommodated, or two million people shall be accommodated; for, I repeat, the presence of slavery is the utter exclusion of free labor

and the institutions of freedom. I deny no one their rights. The slave States are equal to the free States. It is a poor, pitiful and paltry patriotism that cannot take in the entire extent of its country; but I do deny that slavery has the same right as freedom in this country. Freedom is the Isaac; freedom is the heir of promise. Slavery is the Hagar and Ishmael, and they must go into the wilderness, and freedom shall have the entire inheritance. God and the fathers gave it to freedom and free institutions. It belongs to freedom-not to me; not to the citizens of the free States, but to freedom, to the utter exclusion of slaveholding.
Now, gentlemen, I know you are in a mood to take a little advice. (Laughter.) I tell you I love you all. (Renewed laughter.)
Mr. McQuin-I utterly repudiate your love.
Mr. Lovejoy-Sinners did that of Christ; but he loved them still. (Laughter.)
Mr. McQuin-I do not think he love you much.
Mr. Lovejoy-I am afraid that I am not much like him. He went, however, and preached to the spirits in prison; and I think I never approximated so nearly to him as in this regard, while making proclamation of the holy evangel of God to sinners in this House. I tell you of the slave States that you must emancipate your slaves. It belongs to you, and not to us. You must transform them from slaves into serfs, and give them homes, and protect and guard the sanctity of the family. We shall not push you. If you say you want a quarter of a century, you can have it; if you want half a century, you can have it. But I insist that this system must ultimately be extinguished. There is no question about it. You who advocate the perpetuity of slavery are like a set of madcaps who should place themselves on the top of an iceberg which had disengaged itself from the frozen regions of the north, and begun to flow downward, through the warm climates. The sun shines and melts it; the soft winds blow on and melt it; the rains descend and melt it; the water ripples round and melts it; and then these wild visionaries, who fancied they could sail an iceberg through the tropics, start up and blaspheme sunshine and rain and zephyr; and, mounting the heavens, tell Jehovah that, unless he stops the shining of the sun, and the blowing of the winds, and the falling of the rain, they will crumble his universe 'from turret to foundation stone.' (Great laughter.) Do you think God would feel bad? and would not the-archangels tremble at the chivalry? (Renewed laughter.) You may call this extravagant; but you can no more perpetuate slavery, and will no more dissolve the Union, in order to perpetuate it, than you can stop the shining of the sun, or the ripple of the sea, the descent of rain, or the blowing of the wind; ay, no more than you can subdue the ocean, when it lashes itself into fury, and dashes its crested mountain billows against the rocks. It is as preposterous to think of taking slavery down through the civilization of the ages as it is of floating an iceberg through the tropics. It is the order of things. I am willing to concede that you can do anything that any equal number of men can achieve. I did mean to taunt you about Harper's Ferry, but I believe I will not. I am willing to concede that you are as brave as other men, though I do not think you show it by this abusive language; because brave men are always calm and self-possessed. God feels no anger, for he knows no fear.
I say, you can do anything that other men can do. You can preserve and perpetuate this system, if any equal number of men could do it; but the stars in their courses are fighting against you; God, in his providence, is fighting against you. The universe is established upon the great principle of justice and truth: it may be jostled out of its place for a little while, but it will, sooner or later, fall back to its grooves. You must sacrifice slavery for the good of your country. Do this, and you will have the sympathy, the prayers, and the co-operation of the entire nation. Refuse or neglect this-refuse to proclaim liberty through all the lands to all the inhabitants thereof, and the exodus of the slave will be through the Red Sea. It is a well known physiological as well as psychological fact, that ancestral characteristics reappear after a long series of years, and even of generations, as streams disappear, and gush out at a distant point. It is also well known that the Saxon blood is being infiltrated into the veins of the enslaved. By and by, some Marion will be found calling his guerrilla troops from the swamps and everglades of South Carolina; and Patrick Henry will reappear in the Old Dominion, shouting, as of old, 'Give us liberty, or give us death!' Then will transpire those scenes which troubled the prophetic vision of Jefferson, and made him tremble for his country, when he remembered that God was just, and that his justice would not sleep forever, and that every divine attribute would be arrayed on the side of the struggling bondmen. And he justified the uprising by saying, the little finger of American slavery was thicker than the loins of British despotism.
Sir, Virginia cannot afford, the country cannot afford, to continue a practice fraught with so much of peril. It is better to remove the magazine, than to be kept evermore in dread of a lighted match.
The future glory and usefulness of this nation cannot be sacrificed to this system of crime. The nations of the earth are to be taught by our example. The American Republic must repose queen among the nations of the earth. Slavery must die. Carthago est delenda!
The philosophy, therefore, and the lesson which the slave States ought to have learned from John Brown and from all these events, are not these expressions of rage and vengeance. Instead of being stimulated to revenge, Virginia ought to have learned the lesson of penitence. Instead of arraying herself in sheep's-gray, she ought to have put on sackcloth and ashes. Instead of imbibing the distillation of corn, mixed with the products of the poultry-yard, she ought to have drunk the waters of bitterness, in view of her sin of slaveholding.
Mr. Martin of Virginia-And if you come among us, we will do with you as we did with John Brown-hang you up as high as Human. I say that as a Virginian.
Mr. Lovejoy-I have no doubt of it.
[Here the hammer fell.]
A WORTHY RETRACTION. Finding himself misinformed, as to the refusal of the new Plymouth church for Wendell Phillips's disunion lecture, Rev. H. W. Beecher took occasion yesterday to recall, in a most emphatic manner, his language of the previous Sabbath, condemning the Trustees thereof. It appears that the application for the church was not made to the Board, but to a few individual Trustees, and they, by a by-law of several years' standing, had no authority to act, nor was there time, it being then late in the evening, to convene the Board for the purpose. Adhering to his claim for free speech, Mr. B. exonerated the Trustees in the fullest and noblest manner possible. As the resignations sent in by a few of them have not been acted upon, it is probable they will be recalled.-N. Y. Courier and Enquirer, 16th.
SUDDEN DEATH OF FATHER AND SON. At a town meeting a Medway, Monday, Mr. Isaac S. Foster, apparently in a fainting fit, fell upon the floor of the town-house, and soon died. The deceased was about 55 years old, and probably died from some affection of the heart. In view of the solemn event, the meeting was immediately adjourned.
In the afternoon, Mr. Warren Foster, of Hopkinton, son of the above-named person, having heard of the death of his father, was preparing to go to Medway, when he was suddenly seized with apparently a fainting fit, and although medical assistance was at hand, he was not restored to consciousness, but expired in a very few minutes.-Journal.
Hon Wm. Cost Johnson died at his hotel in Washington, Sunday, after an illness of several weeks' duration. Mr. Johnson was 54 years of age at the time of his death. He was somewhat conspicuous in his zeal in behalf of Henry Clay.

NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
BOSTON, APRIL 20, 1860.
ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY.
The Twenty-Seventh Annual Meeting of the AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY will be held in the city of New York, at the Cooper Institute, on TUESDAY and WEDNESDAY, May 8th and 9th, commencing each day at 10 o'clock, A. M.
Independent of all religious and political organizations, and dealing impartially with them all, this Society continues to pursue its grand distinctive object, THE IMMEDIATE AND TOTAL ABOLITION OF AMERICAN SLAVERY, without regard to geographical boundaries, by moral instrumentalities alone-animated by a spirit which seeks the safety, happiness and prosperity of every section of our widely-extended country, 'knowing no East, no West, no North, no South,' as such. Its 'treason' is embodied in the Declaration of Independence, and its 'fanaticism' in the Golden Rule. Declaring that man cannot be the property of man, it measures men, parties and institutions by this simple and unerring test, and will not yield to any compromise, or consent to any postponement of the claims of justice and humanity.
We trust it is needles to remind the members and friends of the Society, that never were greater vigilance and activity demanded on their part than at the present time. The nation is just entering into another Presidential election, which will probably be unparalleled on the score of popular excitement, and which will present a powerful temptation to many to swerve from the strict line of rectitude, by lowering the Anti-Slavery standard for the sake of party success. 'Let the dead bury their dead.' Let us eschew all compromises and compromisers, and be faithful to our rallying-cry, 'No UNION WITH SLAVE-HOLDERS!'
There will be no lack of able and experienced speakers at the Anniversary. [Further particulars hereafter.]
In behalf of the Executive Committee, WM. LLOYD GARRISON, President.
WENDELL PHILLIPS, Secretaries.
C. C. BURLEIGH, Secretaries.

SPEECH OF OWEN LOVEJOY.
To the exclusion of much other matter, and at some inconvenience, we devote a large portion of our inside form to the speech recently delivered by Hon. Owen Lovejoy, of Illinois, in the U. S. House of Representatives-the boldest and most thoroughly anti-slavery speech yet delivered in Congress, and worthy of the brother of the martyred Elijah P. Lovejoy at Alton. Its delivery threw some of the slaveholding members into a paroxysm of fury, so that they could scarcely be restrained from committing bloody violence on the spot. Here is a specimen of the indecent and dastardly manner in which Mr. Lovely was continually interrupted:-
Mr. SINGLETON, of Miss.-No, Sir; any gentleman shall have time, but not such a mean, despicable wretch as that! Mr. BARKSDALE-Order that black-hearted scoundrel and nigger-stealing thief to take his seat, and this side of the House will do it.
Mr. MCQUEEN-We will allow nobody to come over from that side of the House, and bully us on this side.
Mr. BARKSDALE-The meanest slave in the South is your superior. [Cries of 'Order from the Republican side.]
Mr. MARTIN of Va.-I hope gentlemen from the South will let him talk as he pleases; but go away, and not listen to him.
A MEMBER, on the Republican side-Well, go. 'Stand not on the order of your going, but go at once.
Mr. BARKSDALE-I hope my colleague will hold no parley with that perjured negro-thief.
Mr. BARKSDALE-No, sir; you stand here to-day an infamous, perjured villain. [Calls to order.]
Mr. ASHFORD-Yes, he is a perjured villain; and he perjures himself every hour he occupies a seat on this floor. [Renewed calls to order.]
Mr. SINGLETON-And a negro-thief into the bar-gain.
Such is the spirit engendered by slavery! Such are the manners it creates in those who claim to be model gentlemen-the very pinks of chivalry-but whose passions are 'set on fire of hell whenever any man ventures to admonish them of their guilt, and call them to repentance. It is disgraceful and humiliating for decent and upright men to sit in the halls of legislation with such bullies and blackguards-but this is one of the terrible penalties arising from the insane attempt to perpetuate the unholy alliance between the North and the South.

LET THESE BE LIGHT.
TYPE-SETTING MACHINE. It used to be the brag of the old printers that, however invention might succeed in superseding human labor in other branches of business, it never could make a machine to set types. Several inventions, however, have been made, though with indifferent success, and it has, we believe, been all along admitted that the old printers were right, so far as the production of a real practical working machine was concerned. Lately, however, we have had attention called to a machine, the invention of Mr. Charles W. Felt of Salem, that, as far as may be judged from a very imperfect model, bids fair to answer the purpose, to set and distribute type with facility and correctness. A description of the first thought of any machine, with the crudeness of novelty about it, must do it injustice. We can, therefore, only speak of it in a general way-as readily taking the types from a stationary case, with steel fingers, and dropping them in rows into a receptacle below, from which they are removed and arranged into lines. The machine is worked by a key-board, like a piano, and if it can be made practical-which we have little reason to doubt-the setting of type may be made a thing of mathematical exactness. Then trembling proprietors may no longer dread the power of stubborn unions; but, sitting down at their own type-machine, as ladies might sit at their pianos, they can light their cigars, and play with all ease and comfort. We remember a printers strike once where a proprietor took off his coat and went to work, but soon gave it up. With a machine like this, he could have defied the combination. Mr. Felt is getting up a company for manufacturing the machines.-Boston Saturday Evening Gazette.
Ever since the wonderful improvement has taken place in multiplying copies of any newspaper from two hundred and forty impressions an hour to twenty-two thousand, we have been looking with confident expectation for some invention whereby the labor and expense of type-setting would be greatly abridged, and the facilities of composition proportionately enjarged. Having carefully examined the model of the machine designed by Mr. Felt, of Salem, for this purpose, (referred to above,) we are sanguine that it will realize the highest expectations of its ingenious inventor, and work a revolution in printing, co-extensive with civilization, and of the most beneficent character-disseminating light and knowledge at a rate hitherto not dreamed of. Mr. Felt is a young man of meritorious character,-modest, intelligent, persevering, and deserving of all possible encouragement on the part of those who have the means to give him a start. He has given the last six or seven years to the perfection of his world-enlightening machine, with genuine ardor and unfaltering faith, and may now consider the goal as fairly won.
In the U. S. Senate, on Wednesday last, Mr. Sumner presented numerous petitions from Massachusetts, praying for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Law, abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia, and several territories. Laid on the table-25 to 19 a strict party vote.
The speech delivered by Hon. B. R. Johnson, on the Personal liberty Bill, in the New York Assembly, which we have placed on our first page, is a very creditable effort, and will be perused with great pleasure by our readers.

TRACTARIAN GLADIATORSHIP.
When Greek meets Greek, then comes the tug of war!'
The enormous extent and the pernicious character of the influence exercised by the church in this country, is nowhere more fearfully manifested than in its power to keep its members and ministers from acknowledgement and advocacy of the truth, even after they have seen and understood the truth. Who could have supposed that the Rev. Justin Perkins, so long a missionary of the American Board at Oroomiah, and after that so far converted to anti-slavery truth as to have written and published a sermon upon slavery, entitled 'Our Countrys Sin, and also to have written a remonstrance against slavery, designed to be signed by the missionaries of the Board, and then sent home for circulation among American Christians, (a scheme which failed through the backing out of his associates,)-who could have supposed, I say, that this man would now be travelling about this country with the Secretaries of the Board, trying to smooth over the half-discovered guilt of their proslavery position, and to induce enlarged contributions for the payment of their debts and the continuance of their much-abased power! Yet such is the fact!
The Theological Professors at Andover are hedged about by this special precaution, that they must renew the subscription to their creed every five years. But one subscription, with the collateral influences that enforce it, is sufficient to keep imprisoned for life the great majority of those who have trusted themselves within the magic circle of the church. So large a portion of the ideas there inculcated are contrary to the reason which God gave for our guidance, and suppression of truth, misrepresentation, tergiversation, calumny against opponents, and, in the last extreme, direct falsehood, are so freely used to keep up these ideas and to put down their opposites, that the chief managers of this warfare, the ministers and deacons, attain an amazing hardihood in the use of false pretences, and an amazing readiness in the resort to them. The number of direct lies that are told, and the still greater number of false ideas insinuated in language not literally false, in the opposing bulletins that from time to time are darted, like shuttle-cocks, between the New York and Boston Tract Societies, are perfectly astounding. These have been flying back and forth ever since the Boston Branch, in May, 1859, separated from the National Tract Society, and those of each side are equally saturated with falsehood; suited to mislead the public in regard to the side defended as well as to the side assailed; and each tending, in nearly equal measure, to withdraw their respective partisans from that active opposition to slavery which is now the most urgent duty of every American. Their measures for this purpose are as different as would be these two sorts of advice to a man with a disease requiring amputation. One friend tells him to let it entirely alone; another tells him to be sure and take a grain of gum arabic three times a day for the cure of it. The two counsels are very different; the two methods advised are different in everything except their result. Both effectually prevent the cure. And just so the Boston Tract Society, parading its readiness to discuss some of the evils of slavery, while at the same time it discountenances the immediate abolition of slavery, (pretending all the time to be faithfully inculcating the duties of morality and religion,) acts precisely like a medical adviser who should apply assiduous doses of an inert substance, and warrant the sufficiency of this treatment, in a case where speedy amputation was the only remedy. 
The last of the Tract bulletins above referred to, is put forth by the National Society in New York, and is in the form of a conversation between a Deacon and his Pastor. It occupies four-and-a-half newspaper columns, and is signed-A Life Director of the American Tract Society. It originally appeared, I believe, in the New York Times, was afterwards printed in the Journal, of this city, and will appear in the religious newspapers generally as soon as room can be found for it. It is, as I have said, saturated with falsehood. But there is this great security against the recognition of the falsehood by persons commencing the investigation, that it is equally saturated with pious language, which is adapted (and designed) to throw the scrutinizer off his guard; and furthermore that, to come at the full proof of the falsehoods, it would be necessary to trace back their previous transactions through six times that number of columns.
The Managers of the Boston Society, however, are men of zeal, activity and pluck. They have been trained under the discipline of the National Society, and are familiar with the use of both its instrumentalities, piety in the form, deceit in the substance. Their teachers thus far excel them in the  suaviter in modo, a polished courtesy of manner in speaking to and of their opponents before the public; an application of evangelical soft-soap to those whom they are hoping to outwit; but there is little difference between the two in the fortiter in re, when the votes and subscriptions of all the Northern States are the prize in question; and the mendacity of the document forthcoming from the Boston Secretaries may be expected fully to match that of the dialogue manufactured by their New York 'brethren. Read carefully, and you will see.-C. K. W.
The Atlantic Monthly for May is a fine number, containing thirteen articles. E. P. Whipple contributes a paper on Nathaniel Hawthorne; and Miss Maria Mitchell one on Mary Somerville.

There was a literary and musical entertainment in the Twelfth Baptist Church last Monday evening, complimentary to Dr. John S. Rock. After the entertainment, there was a social gathering in the vestry. Notwithstanding the weather was very unfavorable, there was a large attendance. The company enjoyed themselves until a late hour, when they retired. It is probable the Committee will make a report and a presentation at an early day.
Extract of a letter from a gentleman in New York city:-
SAMUEL MAY, JR.-Although connected with the Republican party so far as voting is concerned, I deeply deplore its timid and compromising policy. How much better to be defeated with our principles, than to ensure our discomfiture by explaining away their morality, and diluting them to the level of the ambitious schemes of our leaders! The same influences that defeated Sherman will defeat Seward.
I sometimes read the Liberator to the fire-eaters at our hotel. I reckon, by the way they wince, it is about the kind of medicine adapted to their case.

SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT? '-Among those who have secured their passages for Liverpool in the steamer Europa, which sails from this port on the 16th of May, is Prof. WILLIAM SY-MINGTON BROWN, formerly of Glasgow, who will be cordially received by a large circle of friends on his arrival. They may be assured that he has been true and unflinching, on this side of the Atlantic, to all the reformatory principles and objects he so ardently espoused in his native land.

LETTER TO STEPHEN S, FOSTER.
DEAR SIR:
For many years, I labored under the conviction that slavery most be reached by political action. True, I sometimes had my misgivings as to the best means for reaching the desired result. At length I became more doubtful as to my being in the right; and so I commenced in good earnest the study of righting myself if I were not right. I worked at it till the mists and fogs of doubt were swept entirely from my mind.
Without any desire to disparage your anti-slavery efforts, as such, permit me to express my unqualified dissent as touching your avowed preference for political action, as reported in the Liberator of March 30th. You will yet know that the mistake which you impute to the Garrisonian movement is simply the mistake of Mr. Foster. We must first get the slave free, before we can throw around him the shield of government. We must first free him from the shield of government already thrown around him.
Suppose we concede, for the sake of the argument, that the Constitution contains no guaranty of non-intervention by the Federative Power, and everything by implication is in favor of the abolition of slavery by that Power, still the fact that the Constitution was formed and adopted with the existence of slavery, will, whether fallaciously or not, continue to be regarded as the guaranty of non-intervention by the Federal Power. It is the anchorage of the popular non-intervention sentiment.
By the advocacy of the Union-that it is necessary for the protection of the slave-you would forever defeat the accomplishment of your own purpose-that of bringing Congress to decree the abolition of slavery.
If the government (the Union) is to be perpetuated as a shield for the slave. Congress could never be brought to commit the suicidal act of decreeing the abolition of slavery, since nothing can be more palpable than that such decree would destroy the Union. No, there is not a more potent agency at work for the perpetuation of this monster evil, than this mania for political action as a means for throwing around the slave the shield of government. Is it rational to suppose, for a moment, that the Slave Power would brook the abolition of slavery by Congress? And while there exists this moral certainty that it would not, how are you to bring Congress to abolish slavery, and yet legislate for the preservation of the Union as important for the welfare of the slave? Just here lies the radical defect of your policy.
Of course, if it were possible, in the nature of things, to elect a thoroughly Abolition Congress-one that would abolish slavery and enforce its decree over the slaveholding sovereignties-it would be, with me, the desideratum. But the thing is not possible. Besides, your programme involves too many antagonistic elements.
You say that John Browns work is done. Now, I will venture to predict that it is but just begun. John Brown has simply inaugurated a work. You need have no fears of an 'unorganized force. It will work more and more into a systematic organization.

ESSEX COUNTY A. S. SOCIETY.
A quarterly meeting of the Essex County Anti-Slavery Society was held in Groveland on Sunday, April 1st, commencing at the usual hour.
Henry C. Wright offered the following resolutions:
1. Resolved, That individual slaveholders, as such, have no lights, but are to be regarded and treated as the most inexcusable enemies of mankind.
2. Resolved, That slaveholding States have no rights, but are to be treated by the people and States of the North as self-incorporated bands of American corsairs, whose power it is the right and duty of all the friends of justice and freedom to seek to annihilate.
3. Resolved, That slaves, as such, owe no obedience, service or duties to their enslavers; and a religion or government that enjoins on them such duties or obligations, deserves only the scorn and contempt of mankind.
4. Resolved, That in Helpers Impending Crisis, so generally endorsed by Republicans, we find the true and only scheme for the abolition of slavery-i. e.- No co-operation with slaveholders in politics-No fellowship with them in religion-No affiliation with them in society-No patronage of slaveholding merchants-No guestship in slave-waiting hotels-No fees to slaveholding lawyers-no employment to slaveholding physicians-No audience to slaveholding parsons-No recognition of slaveholding men, except as ruffians, outlaws and criminals.
The above resolutions were ably supported by Mr. Wright and Andrew T. Foss, and formed the principal subject of discussion, both forenoon and afternoon, before a large and respectable audience; and, at the close of the afternoon meeting, they were adopted by the Society. 
The evening meeting was well attended, and was ably and eloquently addressed by Mr. Remond, Mr. Foss, and Mr. Wright. Amesbury, West Newbury, Newburyport, Danversport and Georgetown, were represented, and over eleven dollars were collected for the cause.

A PAMPHLET FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD THROUGHOUT THE FREE STATES.

It is a record of the multitudinous outrages and atrocities which have been visited upon unoffending Northern citizens by the lawless minions of slavery, while travelling or a sojourning at the South, within the last four or five months. A perusal of it is enough to create a soul under the ribs of death, and to stir a fever in the blood of age. Read it, men of the North! and ask yourselves of what value is the Union to you!
This pamphlet makes 144 pages, and will be put a about cost price. Single copy, only 10 cents; by the hundred, $8. For sale at 21 Cornhill.

WASHIXSTON, April 16.
SENATE. Mr. Wilson introduced a bill for the more effectual suppression of the slave trade. It is a bill of nine sections. It provides for the construction of five steam screw sloops of war, adapted to the African coast; increases the bounty from $25 to $100; offers a reward of $100 for the delivery to the U.S Marshal of any slave landed in the country; makes the fitting out of ownership of vessels engaged in the slave trade piracy, and punishes with imprisonment for life instead of death; makes it criminal for a ship not registered to display the American flag as a badge of nationality; makes it the duty of the officer of a ship, before going to the African coast, to report to the U. S Attornies for examination, and provides that American vessels sold abroad should return to the United States for a new register before going to the coast of Africa.
Mr. Mason presented the return of the U.S Marshal (Johnson) on the warrant for the arrest of John Brown, Jr., in Ohio. The return states that it is impossible to arrest Brown, unless an armed force is used or that purpose.
Mr. Mason also presented the return on the warrant for the arrest of B. F. Sanborn, which recapitulates the facts as stated heretofore and adds that no arrests can be made, owing to the judicial proceedings of the State of Massachusetts.
Both warrants and returns were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to inquire and report if any farther proceedings are necessary to vindicate the authority of the Senate, and to fleet the arrest of witnesses.
Mr. Sumner moved to refer the memorial of Mr. Sanborn to the same Committee.
Mr. Mason moved that it be rejected.
Mr. Sumner felt it to be his duty to protest against such a suggestion. It was related of one of the Judges of Hell, that he punished first, and heard afterwards. The Senator from Virginia had taken that as a prevalent.
Mr. Mason said the Senator had used language in making opposition to a motion, which, so far as his intercourse with gentlemen went, he had never heard used outside the Senate, He could not take it as personally offensive. The Senate was the best judge of what was due its decorum.
Mr. Sumner said the Senator from Virginia, in his self-confidence, had undertaken to lecture him on manners. In reply he would say that when any outrage comes before the Senate, he should speak of it as it deserved, and if any precedent from a bad place should apply, he should not hesitate to use it.
Mr. Mason briefly replied, but his remarks were inaudible.
Without disposing of the matter, the special order came up, being Mr. Brown's territorial resolutions.
Mr. Latham of California argued at length to show that there was no irrepressible conflict between labor and capital. There was no capital State without its being a labor State. He deprecated the means by which the Republican party rode into power, and denied that the negro had ever advanced in intelligence for centuries. The irrepressible conflict was a Northern abstraction, used as a lever by sectional men for scattering fanaticism, and riding on it into political power. It was due the South that the North should let slavery alone. California wanted to be neither the ally of a Northern or a Southern Confederacy.
He had faith in the people, and if one section of he Union desired redress, he trusted that they would find it within the Constitution and Union. All had right to take their property into the Territories, which were purched by the common blood and treasure of all.
The resolutions were postponed-yeas 27, nays 25.

MARRIED - In this city, April 11, at the Twelfth Baptist Church, by Rev. L. A. Grimes, Mr. THOMAS R. WATSON to Miss JANE HOWE, both of Boston.
April 12th, by the same assisted by Rev. David Stevens. Mr. WILLIAM WELLS BROSN to Miss ANNIE ELIZABETH, daughter of Mr. William Gray of Cambridgeport.
DIED-In Chelsea, April 14, of congestion of the brain, Mrs. ANNA E., wife of Mr. STEPHEN SIBLEY. It is seldom indeed that a spirit so pure, so earnestly truth-seeking, so morally inflexible, so thoroughly conscientious, so disinterestedly benevolent and philanthropic, so progressive and reformatory in purpose, has been translated to a higher and nobler sphere of existence, Especially was she most deeply interested in the Anti-Slavery cause, and gave to it her warmest support-refusing to be connected with a church which was not alive to the claims of the millions in a worse than heathenish condition at the South.
In Fitzwilliam, March 12, Mr. CHARLES BATCHELLER, aged 34. Although a constant sufferer from childhood, but few enjoyed life better. With keen perceptions of the right, and a conscientious desire to govern his actions by honest conviction, his memory will be clearly cherished by his friends and relatives.

For the Liberator.
AMERICA'S MISTAKE.
O, young America! with thy fresh life
There was a germ of weakness given thee;
Slavery and Liberty can ne'er agree;
One yields in the inevitable strife.
Thou couldst not blend the evil and the good;
When free to choose, hadst thou but firmly stood,
Like a wise son, experience taught by all
The errors, sins, that caused his parents' fall,
What nobler future could a nation ask,
Than thine, unfettered by old, unjust laws;
The progress of a world thy glorious task, 
The championship of Liberty thy cause?
Thy fatal error the sad lesson brings,
Mobs may be tyrants, crueller than kings.
Tenterden, (England.) JANE ASEBY

LITTLE WILLIE WAKING UP.
Some have thought that in the dawning,
In our being's freshest glow,
God is nearer little children
Than their parents ever know;
And that, if you listen sharply,
Better things than you can teach,
And a sort of mystic wisdom,
Trickles through their careless speech.
How it is I cannot answer,
But I knew a little child, 
Who, among the thyme and clover,
And the bees, was running wild;
And he came one summer evening,
With his ringlets o'er his eyes,
And his hat was torn in pieces,
Chasing bees and butterflies.
'Now I'll go to bed, dear mother,
For I'm very tired of play!'
And he said his Now I lay me,'
In a kind of careless way.
And he drank the cooling water
From his little silver cup,
And said, gaily, When it's morning,
Will the Angels take me up!'
Down he sank with roguish laughter
In his little trundle-bed,
And the kindly god of slumber
Showered the poppies o'er his head.
'What could mean his speaking strangely?'
Asked his musing mother then-
'O, twas nothing but his prattle;
What can he of angels ken?'
There he lies, how sweet and placid!
And his breathing comes and goes
Like a zephyr moving softly,
And his cheek is like a rose:
But she leaned her ear to listen
If his breathing could be heard;
'Oh, she murmured, if the angels
Took my darling at his word!'
Night within its folding mantle
Hath the sleepers both beguiled,
And with its soft embracings
Rest the mother and the child;
Up she starteth from her dreaming,
For a sound hath struck her ear-
And it comes from little Willie,
Lying on his trundle near.
Up she springeth, for it strikes upon
Her troubled ear again,
And his breath, in louder fetches,
Travels from his lungs in pain;
And his eyes are fixing upward
On some face beyond the room;
And the blackness of the spoiler
From his cheek hath chased the bloom.
Never more his Now I lay me'
Will be said from mother's knee,
Never more among the clover
Will he chase the humble-bee;
Through the night she watched her darling,
Now despairing, now in hope;
And about the break of morning
Did the angels take him up. E.H SHARS.

THE BABY IS DEAD.
Gather pale flowers,
A spirit has fled;
Twine cypress garlands;
The baby is dead!
Fold the white fingers,
Close the soft eyes,
Angels have carried
The gem to the skies.
Sadly and mournfully
Walk to and fro,
Cover the statue face-
Whiter than snow!
Place the wee coffin
'Neath the damp sod,
Leave the dear lamb
With its Shepherd and God.
Oh! the lone hearth stones-
No light is there!-
Meekly the broken band
Bend low in prayer;
Ah! the dark void,
The mournful tears shed,
The meal passed in silence-
The baby is dead!
Lock up the coaties,'
Put by the crib,
Fold the wee stockings,
The blanket and bib-
Little odd tea-spoon,'
Dainty tin cup,
Rattle-box, earthen dog-
Put them all up!
Go and plant flowers,
Dewy tears shed
On the small earth mound-
The baby is dead! LILLIS A. BROSS.

THADDEUS HYATT.
Another will not soon repeat thy error
Of placing in the Senate too much trust,
Who of some insult to their pride in terror,
Deemed it a condescension to be just.
And we will forgive thee for conceiving
They might be earnest for the truth like thee,
And for at last reluctantly believing
They prized it less than their own dignity.
And for this alone our thanks we render,
That thou didst there a winnowing test apply,
In bold relief placed Liberty's defenders,
And showed the land on whom it can rely.
And though for thee the contest sadly ended,
Thou well mayst tread thy prison floor with pride,
Remembering for what cause thou hast contended,
Remembering who at last were on thy side.
He who endured with fortitude unflinching
Far more than death, and more than speech can tell,
For serving truth with tongue to all-convincing,
For loving Land and Liberty too well.
And he who with his granite hills in keeping
Knows well their strength and firmness to display,
His words like their resistless torrents sweeping
All intervening obstacles sway.
And more, the insulted people are thy pleaders,
The common heart with indignation thrills,
And finally will teach the so-called leaders
That they must fellow when the people wills.

THE LIBERATOR.
REVIEW OF A DISCOURSE
Delivered at South Hingham, January 29, 1860, by J. J. Brayton, Pastor of the Second Parish. 
FRIEND GARRISON:
This discourse has already been appropriately noticed in the columns of the Liberator; it is now proposed to give it some further attention, by exposing some of its false statement, false reasoning, and false logic. The discourse, considered in all its bearings, is one of the most peculiar pieces of composition we have ever met with. The author tells us, very modestly, that he does not well understand the politics of the country, and then proceeds to discuss the moral bearing of slavery, and makes the remarkable admission, that in making a man a slave, it is leaving him no rights uninvaded that are worthy of respect.' And yet he tells us, on the next page, that there are arguments, not without apparent plausibility, that slavery is right.' He regrets,' he says, that he has not read the South-side View of Dr. Adams, that he might present them [the arguments in favor of slavery] more fully, and in their best possible light.' The intent of the discourse does not seem to be to defend slavery as right in itself, for on page 7th he tells us that no maxim of liberality or tolerance can be made sufficiently wide, by rules of truth and justice, to admit the avoidance that slavery is evil, and therefore our duty, by all rightful means, to discountenance, resist and overcome it." The saddest mistake, perhaps, which the author has made through the whole discourse, is the attempt to show that, in general, slavery, viewed in its practical working, is not so bad as is represented here at the North. We are told here that there is a Northern prejudice which loves to make the most of the worst features of slavery,' and also, that the evils of slavery are an off-told tale,' &c; thus attempting to show that the wrongs and cruelties of slavery which are prated so much about among us here at the North are founded in that prejudice which loves to make the most of the worst features of slavery'! 
How consoling, then, it must be to that class of Northern minds, some of which are natural allies of the system, others wholly indifferent to its claims, to be assured that there is, after all this fuss about slavery, a pleasing feature in the system, wholly unknown to the minds of the free colored people at the North: 
'It is claimed that, in general, the physical condition of the slaves of the South is preferable to that of the free negroes of the North; that they are better fed and better clothed, enjoy more bodily comforts, &c. It is claimed that they are seldom sold except as punishment for refractoriness, or from the master's stern necessity, and that it is the custom to avoid, if possible, the separation of families, and the slave is allowed to find, if he can, his own purchaser.'
All these claims are admitted, we are told, on the undisproved professions of Southern men, and of anti-slavery men who have visited the South, and become acquainted with the institution and its workings. 
Now, if all these claims which are put forth so confidently be true, it must be ages before slavery, will be exterminated from our midst, if, indeed, it be not perpetual. The most casual observer cannot fail to know that the highest conception of life among the great masses is, a sufficiency of all the necessary comforts of life. When this is fully attained, the moral and intellectual needs are not likely to be very much inquired into. Satisfy the world that slavery furnishes more bodily comforts than freedom, and I hesitate not to say that much of the interest now felt in the cause of freedom would die out and be forgotten. Hence it is that all such talk is felt to be, and is, to a certain extent, a defence of slavery. 
But do all these claims rest upon the undisproved professions of Southern men'? Even if this were true, it would fail to convince a reasonable mind of the truth of them; for whoever knew a culprit to admit the charges preferred against him? Fortunately, we have testimony from Southern sources which lifts the veil to the gaze of all who have eyes to see, and ears to hear. 
The following is an extract from the will of the celebrated John Randolph, of Virginia: 
'To my old and faithful servants, Essex and his wife Hetty, I give and bequeath a pair of shoes, a suit of clothes and a blanket each, to be paid them annually; also, an annual hat to Essex.' 
It is proverbial that John Randolph was a kind master and a good provider for his slaves. These were favorite slaves of his, and the memory of their long uncompensated toil seems to have touched the old man's heart. Remember, these were faithful servant;' and it would be natural to suppose that the special mention of them in his will was for them to fare better than usually falls to the lot of the slaves. Now, we leave the reader to judge what must be the usual allowance of clothing to common slaves in the hands of common masters, when Essex and Hetty, the old' and faithful' servants of John Randolph, were provided, in his last will and testament, with but one suit of clothes annually, with but one blanket each for bedding, with no stockings, nor socks, nor handkerchiefs, nor towels, and with no change either of under or outside garments! If the colored people at the North are reduced in their means generally to this sad plight, surely freedom presents a melancholy view to the mind of the philanthropist.
Mr. Asa Stone, of Natchez, Miss., says: 
'On almost every plantation, the hands suffer more or less from hunger at some seasons of the year. There is always a good deal of suffering from hunger. On many plantations, and particularly in Louisiana, the slaves are in a condition of almost utter famishment, during a portion of the year.' 
Thomas Clay, of Georgia, a slaveholder, says: 
'From various causes, the slave's allowance of food is often not adequate to the support of a laboring man.' 
Were it necessary, the testimony of Southern men might be multiplied ad infinitum. 
Dr. Channing, of Boston, who once visited Virginia, relates the following in his work on Slavery: 
'I cannot forget my feelings on visiting a hospital belonging to the plantation of a gentleman highly esteemed for his virtues, and whose manners and conversation expressed much benevolence and conscientiousness. When I entered with him the hospital, the first object on which my eye fell was a young woman, very ill, probably approaching death. She was stretched on the floor. Her head rested on something like a pillow, but her body and limbs were extended on the hard boards. The owner, I doubt not, had at least as much kindness as myself; but he was so used to seeing the slaves living without common comforts, that the idea of unkindness in the present instance did not enter his mind.' 
Now, here is a close observer of the workings of the institution,' and he affirms, upon his word, that notwithstanding this gentleman was highly esteemed for his virtues, he was so used to see the slaves living without common comforts, that he looked upon this case with insensibility and indifference. Living without common comforts,' and yet better fed and clothed than the free colored people at the North! 
But are the slaves overtasked? Let Southern testimony answer this question. Hon. G. B. Turnbull, of South Carolina, speaking of the harvesting of cotton, says:'All the women in delicate circumstances, and sickly negroes, incapable of other work, are then in requisiting.' A. A. Stone, from Mississippi, says: It is a general rule on all regular plantations, that the slaves be in the field as soon as it is light enough for them to see to work, and remain there until it is so dark they cannot see.' Mr. C. Gildersleave, from Georgia, says:' It is customary fix the over sears to call out the gang long before day, say three o'clock, while dressing out the crops,' 
Now let the candid reader here judge whether such labor at this is overtasking the slave or not. I submit that it is such tasking at few, if any of us would be willing to undergo. 
But we are told that the the slaves are seldom sold ex-
<c03>
cept as punishment for refractoriness, or from the master's stern necessity, and that it is the custom, if possible, to avoid the separation of families, and the slave is allowed to select, if he can, his own matter whom he will serve.' 
 No fact in the whole slave system stands out more prominently to the eyes of the whole world than this breeding and raising slaves in the States of Maryland, Virginia and Kentucky, for the more Southern market. These Northern slave States do not find it profitable to continue slavery, except by raising slaves for other markets. But do they encourage the raising of slaves, it may be asked, for the purpose of gain merely? Listen to what Mr. Gholson, of Virginia, says in the Legislature of that State:
'It has always (perhaps erroneously) been considered by steady and old-fashioned people, that the owner of land had a reasonable right to its annual profits; the owner of orchards to their annual fruits; the owner of brood mares to their product; and the owner of female slaves to their increase.
Hon. T. J. Randolph, of Virginia, says, it is an increasing practice in parts of Virginia to rear slaves for the market.' The same writer says that' the yearly exportation of slaves for the last twenty years amounted to about eight thousand five hundred.'
 But 'it is the custom, if possible, to avoid the separation of families.' Here again we most put in some more of this undisproved' testimony.
From the New Orleans Bulletin. 
NEGROES FOR SALE.A negro woman, twenty-four years old, and her two children, one eight and the other three. Said negroes will be sold SEPARATELY or together, as desired. The woman is a good seamstress. She will be sold low for cash, or exchanged or groceries. For terms, apply to 
MAYHEW, BLISS & CO.,
1 Front Levee,
STOP THE RUNAWAY.-$25 REWARD.-Ran away from the subscriber, a negro fellow named Nat. He is no doubt attempting to follow his wife, who was lately sold to a speculator named Redmond. The above reward will be paid by Mrs. Lucy McDownmand, of Suffolk county, Virginia.
But families are seldom separated,' we are told. Here again is a woman sold who has two children; they may be sold together or separately, just as the speculator desires. And it this a solitary case, or one which seldom occurs in the slave States?
 The following it from Nile's Weekly Register, published at Baltimore, Md.:
'Dealing in slaves has become a large business; establishments are made in several places in Maryland and Virginia, at which they are sold like cattle. These places of deposit are strongly built, and well supplied with thumb-screws and gags, and ornamented with cowskins and other whips, oftentimes bloody.
These places of deposit, it will be seen, are important to the carrying on of the trade in slaves successfully. When traders are making up a gang of assorted' slaves, as they term it,cooks, carpenters, house servants, &c.,some place of deposit is necessary until the gang get ready to start for the Southern market.
NEGROES WANTED. The subscriber, having located in Lynchburg, is giving the highest cash prices for negroes between the ages of ten and thirty years. Those having negroes for sale may find it their interest to call on him, at the Washington Hotel, Lynchburg, or address him by letter.
All communications will receive prompt attention. 
J. B. McLENDON.
Likely young negroes are what is wanted;families, of course, are seldom separated'! 
In the more southerly slave States, we find advertisements running somewhat as follows:
FRESH ARRIVALS WEEKLY. A well selected stock of negroes, consisting of field hands, house servants, mechanics, cooks, seamstresses, washers, ironers, &c, which we can sell at low or lower than any other house in New Orleans.
'I have just received from the East, seventy-five assorted A No. 1 negroes. Call soon, if you want to get the first choice.
Families are not supposed to be separated! 
We must here respectfully my, that if the reader hat not obtained a glimpse of the slave trade by these extracts, it is only necessary to consult Southern newspapers to undeceive him in this infamous business of buying and selling human beingsbreaking and sundering the tenderest family ties. He will find, too, that slave-dealing is a business operation, carried on with all the cold Indifference of a person dealing in brood-mares, or any other live stock. There are, no doubt, honorable exceptions to this general rule of slave-trading; but exceptions they are, and not the general rule. An old negro of Gen. Washington was once asked if he had any children; to which he replied. I have had eight, but they are all sold away, and I don't know where they now are.' If General Washington could tell away a whole family of eight children from their parents, what must be expected of the general class of slaveholders and slave-dealers at the present time? 
Now the reader will please to notice in this discourse, that we are charged with insulting this class of humane masters, who are guilty of nothing to bad, perhaps, at selling a mother to one person, and her offspring to another. To call this robbery or theft sounds harsh in polite ears, I know; but if your henroost should be robbed, you might then charge somebody with robbing, and be safe from suspicion even of insult. Strange reasoning and strange logic is this! Insulting the SOUTH!! Really, this looks very much like treating the subject impartially.' Who kicked Judge Hoar out of one of the Southern States when sent to transact business for the State of Massachusetts? Who imprison our colored seamen for no crime but their color, and then often doom them to a life of perpetual slavery? Who rifle the mail-bags, and presume to burn and destroy, contrary to law, all books and papers which contain sentiments in favor of liberty and equality Who are the persons who will rifle your trunk and rudely scatter your effects, should they suspect you of taking notes of their manners and customs, or of having in your possession papers favoring the equal rights of all? Who are the persons who fully endorsed the savage and barbarous treatment which our gifted and talented Senator received in the Senate chamber of the U. S. Senate? I answer once for all; it is this class of persons, in whose behalf we are counselled to speak soft and tender words. This is neither right, proper, nor just. Appropriateness of language is always right and proper.
We are further admonished never to abolish slavery by any other means than moral force.' Every kind of compulsion is an evil, and is an additional weight dropped into the balance of sin.' We are disposed to view this counsel as neither wise, just, nor proper. Let every person, then, do just as he pleases until he becomes convinced of the wrong, and is willing to abandon it. If there are persons in Massachusetts who are depraved enough to hold slaves, why, let them do it; no law should interfere, for that is force applied to it, which is an additional weight dropped into the balance of sin.' How stupid the world has been for ages, firmly believing if the heart is not always made better, that giant evils might be arrested, and often overthrown by compulsory measures! If slavery be abolished by war, war may establish it again.' Not indeed if the war be founded upon the moral and religious convictions of the people. Are the people of Massachusetts ready to endorse the opinion that their struggle with Great Britain to obtain their rights was, after all, but a poor and uncertain release' from the tyranny of the mother country? I think not. The idea is too ridiculous to be entertained for a moment. Talk of West India emancipation being the effect of a great moral warfare! A large share of the credit is to be gives to the moral influence which was exerted for its overthrow; but slavery, I far, would have still lived and flourished there, had not the moral sentiment been embodied in a law, and backed up by British cannon. The embodiment of the moral
<c04>
sentiment into any law would be of waste of time, were it not backed up by a compulsory force adequate in its necessity. It must certainly provoke a smile in every intelligent person to be told that the great despotic Russia affords us a still more fresh sample of the efficacy of moral sentiment to the same great end.' A Power that <illegible> the thing, and it is done, and no questions are to be asked! If such victories at these are moral triumphs,' according to the author's definition, then indeed is the Harper's Ferry tragedy a moral effort, though unsuccessful in its results. There is one great moral triumph of freedom which the author should have noticed, though not so fresh as the example of Russia. It is when the British Lion demanded from the Dey of Algiers that all the Christian slaves should be given up, and never more be guilty of piratically capturing up, and enslaving white Christians. This demand was refused, and the account says that Lord Exmouth anchored before the formidable fortifications of Algiers with five line-of-battle ships, and, before night, they fired one hundred and eighteen tons of powder, and fifty thousand shot, besides shells and rockets. The citadel and massive batteries of Algiers were in ruins, and the great slave-dealer was humbled.' We are told there was a universal rejoicing at the announcement of this welcome intelligence, both in this country and Great Britain, for it forever put an end to the barbarous practice of enslaving our own free white citizens.
In the belief in such measures at these, at times, at God-appointed for the overthrow of a great evil,' we are not aware of subjecting ourselves to the charge of infidelity. Indeed, if this it to be an infidel, we stand by a large company of this type; and our only hope is, that these means will be used always for the promotion of freedom instead of slavery. Slavery is worse than war; it is the strong oppressing the weak, by law and by force. We are curious to hear some argument against the practice of this war upon the weak and defenceless, by those who forever counsel peace for one side. We have known moderate drinkers to be eloquent in their appeal for moral means to promote the cause of temperance.
The allusion to the dissolution of the Union, as held by a portion of the abolitionists, is not generous or fair. It is neither fairly stated nor fairly reasoned upon, if, indeed, there is anything which may be called reasoning upon it. And why raise a false issue, or set up a target for one's own amusement merely? We trust the tares will grow together until the harvest,' but are informed by the founder of Christianity that the fields are already white for the harvest.'
To conclude this long, but, I trust, friendly criticism, I wish to say, there are sentiments in the discourse which we can cheerfully adopt as promotive of good to the cause of universal liberty. But the vision of our friend is yet much obscured, probably by battling so long among, the old theological fog-banks. May we not hope that the time will soon come when, in all places,' by word and by deed, our friend will contribute to a genuine moral sentiment and moral power'? Then we will hopefully abide the time when every fetter shall be broken, and all oppression cease beneath the sun.'

LETTER TO HON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD.
HOLLEY, N. Y., March 16, 1850. 
HON. WM. H. SEWARD: 
DEAR SIRBeing one of your immediate constituents, I will not waste time in apologizing for addressing you on a topic of vital interest, not to the black man of this country only, but involving the common constitutional liberties of the white man as well.
I belong to the laboring masses. We farmers, mechanics and laborers have but little interest in politics and government, only to vote intelligently, and see that the government is so administered as to secure our libertiesto protect our persons, houses, papers and effects from unreasonable searches and seizuresour life, liberty and property, the freedom of speech, of the press, and of the ballotto do and enjoy all the acts and rights which freemen have, and of right ought to have, under the Constitution of the United States; for I believe we have no just reason to complain of the administration of the State governments of the free States, but very much of the Federal Government in this direction; and we think we have a right to demand of our Federal statesmen better security of constitutional rights. This is all we ask. I speak in general terms for the whole American family, for if one member suffers, the whole body suffers; hence I speak particularly for myself and mine. 
I am old, have been younger,young enough and old enough, in 1812, to be a pioneer in Western New York, to beat the bush and half beat the British in the second war of independence. Our descendants are numerous; three of them now in the despotic South, and allowed to remain there, and prosecute their business, only under peculiar force of circumstances, which I need not mention here. And here we are, closed from each other's familiar greetings and interchange, through the medium of letters and periodicals, unless blackened with the smut of slavery and varnished with Southern dirt; their parents and numerous friends at the North estopped from correspondence, or allowed it only on condition of a degrading and unconstitutional espionage on their part, and at the risk of compromising the safety and business of the other parties. 
Thousands are going South, and will go, to seek a more genial climate, and a larger field for industry and enterprise. Cannot these be protected in their legal and constitutional rights as though they were sojourning in foreign parts? In the latter case, not a hair of their heads dare be touched. The least right of an American citizen abroad compromised, and the whole army and navy are employed for his protection. Is it so with our own citizens at home? To the shame and disgrace of our pretended free government. No! No Northerner it safe in a Southern State. If from the North, that is enough; he must leave; and if he gets off without a coat of tar and feathers, or other indignities and violence, he does well. Nor is a Southern citizen safer, if he breathes a whisper, or even thinks a thought against this gigantic system of human chattelhood.
I am very familiarly acquainted with two young men, born in this State, graduates of the tame noted seat of learning from which Wm. H. Seward took his degrees, who have gone South, one of them not two years ago, to Alabama, where he procured a paying situation as teacher, from which comfortable position he has been recently ejected, for the only reason that he was a Northerner; though to my certain knowledge he defended the peculiar institution' bravely. The other has more recently made the trial, and writes back to his friends, that Northerners tell me they are kept under a pretty strict surveillance here.' 
Your speech of Feb. 29, 1860, on the admission of Kansas, was a good one; the Tribune and other friends say that. But I must be allowed to say that, in my opinion, it lacks both completeness and directness. The issue is well taken, and the trial of the culprit, Slavery, well prosecutedthe facts of the aggressions of slavery on Freedom well stated. But what is the remedy? That is the question. This history is familiar to the humblest, but what are the guarantees for the future?
Then is one count omitted which strikes deeper at the root of liberty than say one enumerated. The abridgment of liberty of speech and of the press cannot be effected by law. Such a law weald be void under the Constitution of the United States, as would the Sedition Law proposed by that ranting demagogue, don't care, dare-devil Douglas.' After hav-
<c05>
ing a little taste of Alien and Sedition law.' the Fathers anticipated and estopped such petty tyrants by an amendment, or rather extension of tie guarantees of freedom. Art. 1, sec. 1, of amendments. But by insurrectionfor I substitute this word for mob violence, which I think may be done in this case, and do no violence to the meaning of termsI say, by insurrectionary movements of armed man, thirteen printing presses have been destroyed during the irrepressible conflict,' tea of them on professedly free territory, commencing with Elijah P. Lovejoy's, at St. Louis, Mo., who lost his life in defence of it free press, the bird one, at Alton, III., and ending with that of the Free South, at Newport, Ky., on the 28th of October last, conducted by Wm. 8. Bailey. The Federal Government it bound by the Constitution to suppress a ill insurrections, yet no notice is taken of these; but in case of an insurrection in behalf of freedom, the Government would promptly furnish hangmen and hemp for the offenders. 
The present Governor of Kentucky informed Mr.Fee and his forty associates, victims of this insurrectionary violence, on their petitioning him for protection, in substance, that the government of Kentucky was too weak to protect them and their rights against the violence of the mobocrats. Is the Federal Government too weak also? No! if it does not protect, not only these, but every American, at well at home as abroad, it is for want of will. If the States fail to do it, why should not the United States extend its protecting shield? But if this, too, cannot, or fails to protect or secure the liberty of its citizens, the Union is a sham, and the Constitution is not worth the paper on which it is writtenfit only to be trodden under foot of men! Are there not members who will propose measures before Congress, and pass them, for the better security of the people under the constitutional guarantees? Doubtless every member is familiar with the provisions of the organic law. If there be any that are not, they are unfit to be there. 
After assuring the perfect freedom which would be extended to Southern men in case they saw fit to prosecute a political campaign in the free States for the election of any candidates for office, of any party, on any platform they might choose to adopt, you proceed to say, Extend to us the same privileges, and I will engage that you will very soon have in the South as many Republicans as we have Democrats at the North;' and, I add, anti-slavery, instead of pro-slavery Republicans. It would be preposterous to suppose anti-slavery men residing in the slave States advocating the continuance of slavery in their midst, keeping it where it is, as Northern publicans do.
But this is not my point. Extend to as the same privileges.' What privileges? Are not the citizens, both North and South, entitled by right to these privileges, under the Constitution bestowed by the Fathers, without begging them from politicians of the North, or a handful of oligarchs of the South. Must we depend on the nod of these? Or is the operation of these rights to be narrowed down and limbed north of Mason and Dixon's line? or to territories where are no or next to no inhabitants, and slavery extinguished and freedom established by ambuscade in the woods? 
'The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.' Does this mean nothing? The freedom of speech or of the press shall not be abridged, or the right of the people to peaceably assemble, and petition the government for a redress of grievances.' Where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and preserved in all criminal cases.' Are these provisions glittering generalities' or realities? What is a government worth that does not protect its citizens? Like begets like. We have had insurrections against freedom without number, but none of the mobocrats or insurrectionists have been brought to justice, or an attempt made in that direction, though the government is bound to suppress these, and protect the people from their violence. How long think you this state of things shall last, ere an opposing insurrection breaks forth, for the security of rights which the government fails to protect, which might grow to revolution and be difficult to overcome, and sweep the disturbing element from the land? Slavery propagandists better not tempt that day! Scarcely a speech is delivered by Southern members, in either House of; Congress, without a sprinkling of vehement clamor relative to Southern rights under the Constitution, mingled with fierce threats of disunion unless they are allowed such rights. 
Why should not the Constitution be analyzed in their presence, and see how the account stands? Slavery has no part nor lot in that instrument; it is not polluted by it. The Fathers found slavery in all the States but one, and under the rule they themselves adopted, that' The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to it by the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.' Article X. of Amendments. Slavery, or the right to hold slaves, was never delegated to the United States,' nor prohibited by it.' The Fathers left it where they found it, in the States, and said to those States, When your laborers run away, you may catch them, if you can, and no sister State shall let or hinder. And they gave further liberty that they might be represented in Congress, not as chattels, but as 'persons'men. Here is all there is of slavery in the Constitution of the United States, and that is none at all; it is an institution outside of that, belonging to the States, and if the Constitution were enforced, would push slavery to the wall, and these two provisions would die of their own accord, outside the camp, like the leprous person under the Levitical code, without an expunging from the statute books, for there would be no slaves to run away, and none to represent.' 
You say abolition cannot follow from the action of the Constitution. Give us protection and free play to speech, press and ballot, and we would batter it down while you were firing the first platoon of blank cartridges in the territories. Nay, more' The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government.' Give fair play to this untried battering-ram, and slavery would be rooted from the American soil, and numbered with the things that ware, for a slave government is a despotism, not a republican form of government. 
You say the Republican party will take up the word Union, coupled with Liberty, come what may, in victory as in defeat, in power as out of power, now and forever.' This sounds very well indeed on paper. But words, it is said, are empty things.' What is the fact of Union and Liberty? There is none, unless discord and tyranny are union and liberty. Slavery is the constant, ever-present, disturbing element; the numerous historical facts in the speech under review show this. It breeds, and will breed, discord and tyranny. There are more union, liberty and fraternity between the British possessions under monarchical government, stretching along our northern borders and the north, than between the Northern and Southern States of this pretended Union. Not withstanding the immense sacrifice of blood and treasure to wrench ourselves from England, after eighty years' trial, there is more safety and liberty today, under the British Government, than under our own Federal Administration, and all right-minded man and women would choose the former to the latter. Will American statesmen continue this state of things till the General Government becomes a hissing and by-word among the nations, contemptible in the eyes of the American people, and our experiment proves a failure? 
The President is being put on trial for the alleged corrupt misapplication of public money. The money of the people is of small value, compared to their liberties. Is my humble opinion, the Executive should extend the protecting arm of the Government by proclamation, backed by suitable force, as a protection 
<c06>
and passport to every children of the Republic, in his person, house, papers and effects, in his life, liberty and property, to travel and to speak, to write, print, and circulating any printed matter; liable for the abuse of these privileges, not to lynch law, but only to the laws and Constitution of the land; and all branches of the government should unite and suppress every unauthorised combination of armed men, under what over pretext.
Most respectfully yours, C. ROBINSON.

MR.PILLSBURY'S LECTURES.
EARLVILLE, (Illinois,) March 22, 1860.
To the Editor of the Liberator:- Having just read a letter, published in your paper, signed by M. HESLET and others, respecting PARKER PILLSBURY'S lecturers in Earlville, we could not, in justice to ourselves or to Mr. P. let it pass unnoticed. It is not our wish to be understood as applauding or denouncing the public or private course of citizens here, but simply to state the cause of this difference in opinion, or this strange version of Mr. P.'s effort here. We are quite sure there is not an independent thinker here, who sure there is not an independent thinker here, who will not give his testimony with us.
In the first place, A. J. Grover is a very radical man, with large combativeness and a susceptible temperament; one who is ever ready to do battle for the right.' and he sees it. In politics, a real Garrisonisn Abolitionist,' so called here. In religion, an avowed opposer to everything sectarian. Consequently, he has many personal enemies, especially amongst one church-loving people.
Secondly, our citizens (very man of them) deem radicalism in religion as infidel or atheistical; in politics as traitorous. With this difference in the political and religious constitution of individuals, would they receive the same impressions of a discourse upon human freedom (all being honest)? If not, whose would be the most likely to be correct? Remembering Parker Pillsbury in the East and the West to be the self-same man, could you recognize him in the vulgar, self-importance, political partisan as described by our citizens? Could you see in their picture the long well-known, unassuming, firm, honest, eloquent and fearless advocate of human rights? His first lecture, although not anti-slavery direct, certainly was in effect-being a most eloquent appeal to the higher faculties of equal individual to be himself, to act upon his own responsibility; not to give an abolition vote because he did, but under all circumstances each to be true to his own highest convictions of right. Would every one build upon this superstructure, how soon the ail of the African slave, and the cries of the oppressed in every land, might be turned into songs of joy! Would some of our citizens throw aside their sectarian glasses and personal animosities, we think they would not understand Mr. P. as denouncing all who do not believe with him as hypocrites and renegades, or as desiring to demolish the church universally, because he gave a rather severe reprimand to the American or pro-slavery church,-making a strong distinction (as we understood him) between this and the true Christian church, which says practically, Do unto others as ye would they should do unto you.'
Of his last discourse, (not being able to attend,) our family said-'We have listened to one of the noblest, most powerful efforts in behalf of human freedom ever uttered.'
Yours, in the love of right,
S. HOXIE RICHARDSON.

LETTER FROM A FRIEND.
DEAR FRIEND GARRISON-The following extracts from the letter of a whole-souled anti-slavery woman,-written soon after the John Brown demonstration at Harper's Ferry,- I feel deserve an insertion in the Liberator. If you think so, I will take the responsibility of publishing what was penned only for my own reading. W. C. N.
'We read everything connected with the present existing crisis, and I rejoice that it is my privilege to sympathize with the oppressed. Our anti-slavery leaders have acted nobly in this matter, and even more fully than I expected have they endorsed John Brown. I was afraid they would feel such repugnance to his means of attacking the evil, that it might lead them to censure him somewhat.
I have faith in the awakening of public sentiment, if all anti-slavery persons would be as faithful as a few are, and believe that in time the South would yield to the power of reason and truth.
I am fully committed to the side of moral influence, and yet I cannot blame the slaves for taking freedom at any hazard; indeed, I should blame them for not doing it, if I did not believe they were too ignorant, as a mass, to be successful. I could not advocate the shedding of blood, if I believed is right, as I have not the physical courage to aid in it; and I would not urge others into danger I was myself afraid to face. Still, I think John Brown acted nobly, and so did his family; and I feel, when reviewing the scenes of the past month or two, as though I was not worthy even the name of an abolitionist, so little have I ever done for the cause of freedom.
I do not expect that slavery will ever be abolished peaceably, for all minds do not operate in accordance, even for the promotion of the same end; therefore I endorse Garrison's view of the subject, and say, welcome to every truly on the side of freedom!
How much those people miss who do not read anti-slavery papers!
This reminds me to tell you, that an exceedingly interesting and cultivated young friend of mine has become an enthusiastic abolitionist, under the teaching of the Liberator, which I have lent him; and he in turn leads it to others, who enjoy it highly.
The amusing thing is, that he is most warmly engaged in the advocacy of fighting for freedom. So you see that Garrison has a hand in making all sorts of abolitionists!'

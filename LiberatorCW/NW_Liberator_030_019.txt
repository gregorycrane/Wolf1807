REFUGE OF OPPERSSION 
<c01>
THEODORE PARKER ON WINE-DRINKING.
Wine-bibbers, and the opponents of the temperance cause generally, seem to be highly gratified with the letter of Mr. Parker, recently published, claiming for wine-growing and wine-drinking countries far less of drunkenness than exists even in New England, and preferring a license law to any scheme of legal prohibition. After making an extract from this letter, the Boston Courier makes the following characteristic comments, which will not be very gratfying to
Mr. P.
These are sound and sensible views: our readers will not readily guess the source from which they come. They are from a man whose learning, vigor of mind, moral courage, and general intellectual power are beyond dispute, but who has not in all things so comported himself as to earn a reputation for the good sense and practical wisdom which are unquestionably displayed in the above extract. The writer is no less a man than Theodore Parker. Now, it strikes us as a curious interllectual phenomenon, that a man who writes so calmly and reasonably on the subject of drunkenness, should write so absurdly and so madly on the subject of slavery. Whenever Mr. Parker writes or speaks on slavery, he reminds us of nothing so much as a drunken Malay, running a much through the streets with a knife in his hand. He is under no impulse but that of a blind, headlong, insane fury, which has neither eyes nor ears nor understanding. Not long since, he sent a letter from Rome on John Brown's foray; commending it, holding it up to applause and imitation, and affirming it to be the true way if dealing with slavery. The sentiments of that letter are simply atrocious: but we do the writer the justice to believe that, like all closet politicians, he was not aware of the moral significance of the strong language which, under great excitement, he was using. To us, the prominent quality of that letter was its folly. It was wild, absurd, and monstrous. There was no sense, no reason, no knowledge, no comprehension in it. Upon the question of drunkenness, he observes, reflects, compares, and comes to sound conclusions: when dealing with slavery, he shuts his eyes and his ears, and treats of it like the German philosopher, who, when required to write about the camel, sat down in his study to evolve the idea of a camel from the depths of his own consciousness.
It is singular, that so acute a mind does not perceive that the Maine Liquor Law way of dealing with intemperance, and the John Brown way of dealing with slavery, are open to the same objections on principle: they both refuse to recognize the practical difficulties in each case. The Maine Law fanatic maintains that intemperance is an evil so huge and hideous, that it admits of no degrees: moderate drinking is as bad as getting drunk: claret is as naughty as whiskey: he who likes a glass of wine with his dinner is, on the whole, worse than he who besots himself with wine or brandy. Thus he aims at entire suppression; and failing that, at nothing.
To regulate, moderate and control are objects which he disdains to regard. this side of total abstinence presents no point which it is worth his while to try to reach. It is in vain to say to him, that the Maine Liquor Law is impracticable; and that it is better to aim at some reasonable reform, which may be accomplished, that to waste one's energies in the pursuit of unattainable good.-LLis answer is, the Maine Liquor Law, or nothing at all.
So the John Brown way of dealing with slavery goes no farther than to point out that slavery is an evil; it does not stop to consider the difficulties in the case, or how to overcome them. Practically, the result was just as complete a failure as have been all attempts to suppress intemperance by prohibitive legislation. He acted as if it were better to be dead than to be slave; to some men this may be so, but the average man does not think so.
If Mr. Parker were as fanatical upon the subject of intemperance as he is upon that of slavery, the Maine Liquor Law would not be half strong enough for him. He would have the man who gets drunk, and the man who sells him the liquor to get drunk with, alike put to death, or at least imprisoned for life. He has, doubtless, in his ample library, a copy of 'Leslie's Short Method with the Deist; Parker's short method with slavery might be written on the palm of one's hand; it is just this-the slaves shall kill their masters, and the remaining whites shall kill the slaves. This would be very effectual, but is hardly practicable. We shall never live to see drunkenness suppressed by prohibitory legislation; we shall never live to see slavery suppressed by extermination, either of master or slave. In both cases, we had better make up our minds to try some other plan.

THE EVIL SPIRIT.
The Massachusetts courts have decided that the process from the U.S. Senate for the arrest of the contumacious witness, Sanborn, was informal. It is by no means certain that a Massachusetts court, under the influence of the dominant antislavery passions, would allow any process, for the compulsory attendence of a witness in the John Brown inquiry, to be lawful. The grounds for this decision are very weak -mere fetches to excuse the refusal to do a plain duty. Such as they are, however, they give a color of defence to the violence with which the servie of the process was resisted, and the attempt made to rescue the witness by force from the hands of the officers. The turbulent men who rushed with the fury of a mob to prevent the Deputy Marchsal from making the arrest, now complcently aver that they have the endorsement of the courts for their conduct, as lawful in resisting unlawful acts. But it is entirely certain,that this was not the original ground for forcible intervention. The legality or regularity of the process were not thought of when they surrounded the officer, and attempted to take his prisoner from him. They resisted the seizure, without knowing or considering whether it was legally made, or not; it was an effort to obtain an unwilling witness to testify about the complicity of Northern Abolitionism with the outrage at Harper's Ferry, and the feeling of Massachusetts broke out in the violent demonstration, that he should not be taken away for that purpose. If it was afterwards discovered that there was a technical informality, which would have secured the prisoner's discharge, that is no excuse for the riotous combination to prevent his arrest. The determination to screen the witnes, at all hazards, even to the forcible resisting of the law and its agents, was as manifest in the obstruction to the legal course for securing his acquittance, as it would have been in plain resistance to a legal summons. That attempt was equally disorderly; and the resolve to defy the law and its officers, and uphold the abolotion emmissaries and tools, by open force, was equally conpicuous. It was, indeed, subsequently avowed, without qualification or reserve, at public meetings held in the State for the
<c02>
expression of the public opinion on these incidents. It was there audaciously proclaimed that a process that kind could not be executed in Massachusetts, for which the orator spoke. It was not an informal or irregular process which is thus defied. It is every process having for its object the summoning of testimony against the John Brown conspirators. This is the femper-we will not say of Massachusetts, for there are moderate, constitutional, conscientious men in Massachusetts, who denounce these violent men and their acts-but it is the temper which has colored most of its recent legislation, and pervades the proceedings of the political conventions of the dominant party, and in the ordinary demonstrations of popular feelings.
The same spirit, roused into a more open act of insubordination to lawful authority, has made itself scandalously notorious in Ohio. The Marshal of the United States for the Northern district of, Ohio had his process to serve for the arrest of one the young Browns, needed as a witness before the Investigating Committee of the United States Senate. The Ohio Republicans do not pretend to, muddle the question with any disquisition upon the formality or informality of the papers- the legality or illegality of the demand for the person of the witness, who is wanted to disclose the real history of the Harper's Ferry conspiracy. They say flatly that the Senate shall not have him at all. They will protect and defend him in refusing to go they defy the authorities to come and take him, and have given notice that he is surrounded by friends who have arms for his protection. The Marshal, of course, cannot find a posse with which to compel, obedience to his warrant, for the whole vicinity is infected with the same furious abolition frenzy. He has been obliged to report that he cannot execute, the summons without employment of an armed force. Judging from the exhibition of popular power there, the force required would be very large. John Brown, Jr., therefore, goes at large, in Ohio, guarded by the muskets of Western Reserve Abolitionists, defying the power of Congress to touch him. The rampant declaration flaunts itself in Ohio, in open contempt of the Federal authorities, for no other ground than that they are pursuing investigation into the connection of Abolitionists with the bloody deeds of Harper's Ferry. The courts of Massachusetts, by unworthy quibbles, have given countenance to the same refractory spirit; and the Governors of Ohio, Iowa and Illinois, in their recent action on the same subject, have shown a willingness to misuse their executive functions in pandering to these insubordinate sectional passions. 
THE INQUISITION IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS.
The Golconda Herald of the 13th inst. continues its war on the Rev. James M. West in the following strain:-
'That he is a circulator of abolition documents, he dare not deny; that while he officiates as a colporteur for the 
"American Reform Tract and Book Society," he cannot be a law-abiding citizen, nor a good Christian; that where such documents as he circulates are read and believed, there cannot exist any attachment to the union of these States, nor respect for the general laws of the land. Politically we are his enemy, and shall use all honorable means in our power to subvert his influence; for we known, if his opinions predominate, Democracy cannot. We reiterate our former threat as it is termed, that if he cannot conduct himself as a law-abiding citizen and a Christian, he must leave for parts more congenial to his sentiments. Treason and fanaticism shall not be taught in our community with impunity, and we again repeat that he had better desist.
'He says that he will hereafter "utterly disregard anything that shall appear in the Herald in the shape of persecution." Well, he may do so, but! we doubt whether the citizens of Pope County will, Already we have received several letters, requesting us to propose his banishment from the county; but this we have refused to do, because it would not help the matter. We think when he is more generally known, he will suspend operations of his own accord, as he will not be aided or countenanced by the people. But he receives $25 per month for acting as colporteur for the Abolition Tract Society, of Cincinnati, which, we suppose, is sufficient to sustain him. We warrant him, however, that it will be an unprofitable and dangerous method of procuring a livelihood hereafter in this county. Here is his epistle, verbatim, et literatim, et punctuatim. It is a rich one:-
BROAD OAKS, Pope Co., Ill., April 12, 1860.
Editor Golconda Weekly Herald: 
DEAR SIR: I notice in your last issue a continuation of this abusive course of falsehoods and misstatements, which has been heaped upon a civil and unoffending citizen, for no other cause, than to sink the reputation of an individual, in consequence of entertaining a difference of opinion, on the subject of American slavery. The truth of it is, if the whole of it was divested of error and misstatements, there would be nothing left that would be derogatory to the character of a gentleman or a Christian.
In your last issue you publish a falsehood, and saddle it on 'Elder David Ragains.' And so much of the statement, as appears over the fifty names, as relates to the stolen horse, is utterly false, and such a thing never entered my mind, until I heard of it in relation to that instrument of writing.
And so far from those fifty underwriters being my neighbors, there is nine of them that, to the best of my knowledge, I never saw, or heard their names before. Hereafter, I shall expect to utterly disregard anything that may appear in the Herald, that appears, in the shape of persecution. Should any persons entertaining different views, wish a fair and candid investigation, they can be accommodated.
In haste, yours truly,
JAMES M. WEST, 
Colporteur American Missionary Association 
From the Columbus (Ohio) Statesman.
WHERE ULTRA ABOLITIONISM LEADS 
In the first stages of this sectional fanaticism, a deep interest is manifested in the Christian religion, and it is averred that it is because the law of God commands it, that resistance is made to the Fugitive Act, and all other legal or constitutional provisions with reference to slavery. Ministers unite in this matter, and the pulpit is desecrated; but everything is done because it is alleged to be a high and imperious Christian duty. That is the first step. Gradually infidelity takes bold, and its growth finally absorbs all the members of these 'anti-slavery churches' and communities, until it not uncommon to bear men of age, ' thrift and intellignenc,' rejoice that they have escaped from the false faith they once professed, as they term the Orthodox, and are now safely grounded in ' morality and progressive reform,' which means, of course that they are now good stout infidels. That is the ultimate destiny of all these gentlemen known as Christian Anti-Slavery men.' 
Thus, it seems to be 'safely grounded' 'morality and progressive reform' constitues one an 'infidel'!

DANIEL O'CONNELL ON AMERICAN SLAVERY
EXTRACTS FROM HIS SPEECHES.
Man cannot have property in man. Slavery is a nuisance, to be put down, not to be compromised with and to be assailed without cessation and without mercy by every blow that can be levelled at the monster. I am an Abolitionist. I am for speedy, immediate abolition. I can not what caste, ereed, or color, slavery may assume. Whether it be personal or political, mental or corporeal, intellectual or spiritual, I am for its total, its instant abolition. I enter into no compromise with slavery. I am for justice, in the name of humanity, and according to the law of the living God.
I will now go to America. I have often longed go there, in reality; but, so long as it is tarnished by slavery, I will never pollute my foot by treading on its shores. (Cheers.) In the course of my Parliamentary duty, a few days ago, I had to arraign the conduct of the despot of the North, for his cruelty to the men, women and children of Poland; and I spoke of him with the execration he merits. But, I confess, that although I hate him with as much hatred as one Christian man can hate another human being, viz.: I detest his actions with abhorrence, unutterable and indescribable; yet there is a climax in my hatred. I would adopt the language of the poet, but reverse the imagery, and say,
In the deepest hell, there is a depth still more profound,' and that is to be found in the conduct of the American slave-owners. (Cheers.) They are the basest of the base-the most execrable of the execrable. I thank God that upon the wings of the press, the voice of so humble an individual as myself will pass against the western breeze-that it will reach the rivers, the lakes, the mountains, and the glens of America-and that the friends of liberty there will sympathize with me, and rejoice that I here tear down the image of Liberty from the recreant hand of America, and condemn her as the vilest of hypocrites-the greatest of liars. (Long continued cheers.)
Of all man living, an American citizen, who is the owner of slaves, is the most despicable; he is a political hypocrite of the very worst description. The friends of humanity and liberty, in Europe, should join in one universal cry of shame on the American slaveholders! 'Base wretches,' should we shout in chorus-' base wretches, how dare you profane the temple of national freedom, the sacred fane of republican rites, with the presence and the sufferings of human beings in chains and slavery? '(Immense cheering.)
I say unto you, freemen of America, and the press will convey it to you almost as swift as the wind, that God understands you; that you are hypocrites, tyrants, and unjust men; that you are degraded and dishonored; and I say unto you, dare not to stand up boasting of your freedom or your privileges, while you continue to treat men, redeemed by the same blood, as the mere creatures of your will; for while you do so, there is a blot on your escutcheon which all the waters of the Atlantic cannot, wash out.
I tell the American slave-owner that he shall not have silence; for, humble as I am, and feeble as my voice may be, yet deafening the sound of the westerly wave, and riding against the blast as thunder goes, it shall reach America, telling the black man that the time for his emancipation has come, and the oppressor that the period of his injustice is soon to terminate!
Let America, in the fullness of her pride, wave on high her banner of freedom and its blazing stars. I point to her, and say, ' There is one foul blot upon it; you have negro slavery.' They may compare their struggles for freedom to Marathon and Leuctra, and point to the rifleman with his gun, amidst her woods and forests, shouting for liberty and America. In the midst of their laughter and their pride, I point them to the negro children screaming for the mother from whose bosom they have been torn. America, it is a foul stain upon your character!

I fling this black dishonor on the star-spangled banner of America-in vain does it wave over every sea, proclaiming the honor of the boasted republic of modern times-those who fight under it are felons to the human race, (hear, hear,) traitors to liberty, to their own honor, and blasphemers of the Almighty. The red arm of God is bared; and let the enemies of those whom his Son died to save, the black man as well as the white man, beware of its vengeance! The lightning careers through the troubled air resistless, amidst the howling of the tempest and rolling of the thunder. Oh, for one I moment of poetic inspiration, that my words, with the fire of indignation with which my bosom barns, may be borne on the western breeze across the wide Atlantic, light on their shores, reverberate among their mountains, and be wafted down the rivers of America!
Lot the proud Americans learn, that all parties "in this country unite in condemnation of their conduct; and let them also learn that the worst of all aristocracies is that which prevails in America-an aristocracy which has been aptly denominated that of the human skin. The most insufferable pride is that shown by such an aristocracy. And yet I must confess that I cannot understand such pride. I can understand the pride of noble descent. I can understand why a man should plume himself on the success of his ancestors in plundering the people some centuries ago. I can understand the pride arising from immense landed possessions. I can, even understand the pride of wealth, the fruit of honest and careful industry. Yet when I think the color of the skin making men aristocratic, I fee; my astonishment to vie with my contempt. Many a white skin covers a black heart; yet an aristocrat of the skin is the proudest of the proud. Republicans are proverbially proud, and therefore I deligh to taunt the Americans with the superlative mean, as well as injustice, of their assumed airs of superiority over their black fellow-citizens. I will continue to burl my taunts the Atlantic And, oh!-but perhaps it is my ride that dictate the hope-that some black O'Connell might ride among his fellow slaves, who would cry, Agitate agitate, till the two millions and a half of his fellow-sufferers learned the secret of their strength- learned that they wen two millions and a half.
My sole object is to rouse the attention of England and Europe to all that is cruel, criminal, and as in every sense of the word, infamous, in the system of negro slavery in North America. My delibera. conviction is, that until that system abolished, no American slaveholder ought to be received on a looting of equality by any of the civilized inhabi ants of Europe.
<c04>
I have no superfluous tears to shed for Ireland, I and shall show my love of ay country by continuing my exertions to obtain for her justice and good government; but I feel that I have something Irish at my heart, which makes me sympathize with all those who are suffering under oppression, and forces me to give to universal man the benefit of the exertions which are the consequence. And what adds peculiarly to the claim of Ireland for sympathy and support is, that in the great cause of suffering humanity, no voice was ever raised, but Ireland was found to afford relief and succor.
THE HORBIBLE COOLIE TRAFFIC. We have received a printed copy of a Report on the Coolie Trade made to the U. S. House of Representatives, by Hon. Mr. Eliot of Massachusetts, from the Committee of Commerce. Among the various papers embodied in it, showing the nefarious nature of the trade, is the following by a Chinese:- 
Mr. Williams, the Secretary and Interpreter of the United States Legation, translated the following argument respecting kidnapping and selling pigs to foreign vessels,' which was forwarded by Dr. Parker to the State Department in January, 1857: 
AN ARGUMENT RESPECTING KIDNAPPING AND SELLING PIGS TO FOREIGN VESSELS.
Among the most distressing things for man is to eave his friends, (as in pursuit of a livelihood,) and to die away from them; still (in such a case) if he becomes diseased and sick, and medicines are unavailing to cure his ailments, he can calmly close his eyes in death, his relatives sorrowing, as they do, for his loss, will yet in time lay aside their mourning. 
But what is ten thousand times more distressing,' than this, is what I have mysalf personally heard and seen, is being kidnapped and sold on board foreign ships-it is a thing that excites the bitterest hatred and grief.
Recently a set of reckless villains have devised a ' cunning scheme, going around from hamlet to village, in cities and fairs, where they kidnap silly people and sell them on board foreign vessels, in which they are taken to foreign regions, there to toil forever in bitter service. This is vulgarly called; selling pigs, and, in truth, it differs in nothing from the sale of swine.
These miscreants go prowling about every where, and when they see a poor and sorry man, they embrace the occasion to beguile and deceive him, as the circumstances of the case suggest; they will teil him, for instance: It is very distressing to see you live so beggarly and wretched, and I have a way to relieve you which I can recommend; there are foreign ships about going to Australia, to F00 Chow, to Shanghai, or elsewhere, where there is great demand for workmen. You need to be at no expense for passage or outfit, and if there is any profit they promise to divide it with you. The poor man hearing these crafty and delusive words invariably falls in with the proposition, and is urged and go at once on board to see the captain. He knows not that once there, (for this man is in league with the foreigner,) he will be straightway confined in the ships hold, and the hatches locked on him. Then, though he had wings, he could not escape, he can only uselessly regret his fate. While his body is thus confine in the hold of the ship, like a man in a dark hellish dungeon, his thoughts recur to his father and mother, whose toilsome care in nurturing him has bean, as it were, incontinently thrown into the deep. The love and kindness between husband and wife is thus vilely sundered for no purpose, and children, relatives, and friends can no more be seen in this life. If a man falls sick on board, and his malady is not cured in four or five days, he is tied up with a hempen rope, and cast into the sea or on the beach. While I was passing once in a boat, I saw several men thus tied up, who were imploring the gods to deliver them and save their lives.
Really I could not bear to hear them, and wished to go to their rescue; but my boatmen strongly urged me not to do so, alleging that the foreigners had pistols in their hands, and I should only get injured if I tried.
Those who live to reach the foreign country, there to toil in bitter service; if cold, they have only a shirt to cover them; if hungry, only vile rice for food; if thirsty, only water from the bills to drink and at night they sleep in forests and thickets. Every day they are hurried to carry earth or plough the soil, or made to transport stones, or dig the mines without cessation. If one happens to idly rest, the foreigner cudgels him at his pleasure, and thus he drags out a toilsome existence, seeking for death in vain. Moreover, there are dreadful wile beasts and venomous serpents which pursue men and awfully furious storms of rain, all of which grievously injure and weaken the body. How sad how distressing to endure all these calamities in con sequence of the deception of one hour! 
Now, any man who has received a body from his progenitors, and was born in civilized and affluent China, can, if he be diligent and thrifty, and do no fail in his duty, support himself and live on the fruits of his labor. Why should he be so foolish a to be cajoled by rascals and sold into foreign parts separated from his own flesh and blood while alive and then become a vagabond devil is unknown n gions when he is dead? 
I have a nephew who has been to those countries where he saw more than twenty thousand Chinese who had been thus deceived, but he contrived to escape after many adventures, and has told all this to me.
I on my part presume to let others know it, it, hopes that benevolent and kind gentlemen will circulate this information in villages, so that ever body may be aware of these schemes, and not far into the traps.
Perhaps they will petition the authorities rigorously punish such fellows, that others be wanted from these had practices, and the lives of our countrymen be saved. This is what I earnestly hope.
As for those truculent villains who act so cruelly, they no longer retain any trace of heavenly rectitude, nor even of human feeling.
Even if they escape punishment in this world they certainly will suffer the destruction of hades. Let, them, therefore, straightway reform their conduct, nor imagine there in no retribution for such conduct.
I am aware that I am not as elegant writer, I hope the readers of this will not cast it away because of its rude style.
A respectful address to all who love virtue. 
To be posted every where for the people to see it. Have respect for printed paper, (i e., do not tear it down.) The blocks are kept in a shop in Tsiang-Ian street, in Canton, where Kind persons can get as many copies struck off as they wish.

THE PRESS IN DELAWARE.
Correspondence of the N. Y. Tribune.
LEWIS, Del., April 21, 1860.
The Grand Jury of Kent County, Md., have had the Postmasters before them, made inquiries relative to newspapers taken at the different offices, and directed the Postmasters to retain and not deliver( New York Tribune and Delaware Republican.
The Postmasters are somewhat exercised upon the subject. They are generally storekeepers, and hence have nothing to gain by crossing those of their customers who are so eccentric as to receive the obnoxious journals. There appears to be a goodly number of these subscribers, and they are, without any exception that I know of, persons of respectability-some possessed of considerable property, and all naming a will of their own. They feel aggrieved upon the subject-very much as though their privileges have been taken away, or at least curtailed. I say privileges, because there appears to be a doubt about, their having rights.
They are law-abiding folks, with diversity of opinion on the exciting subjects of the day. Severs are slave-owners, some non-slaveholders, but I have beard of none who would think it right in any, sense to meddle with slaves, or to do any act to cause insubordination. They appear to be willing to live in peace and social intercourse with their neighbors. Whatever opinions they may entertain upon the justice or expediency of slaveholdiog, they are united in that of considering it their duty to live in conformity to the laws of the State under which they aide. There are many, however, that upon the question of the day, the extension of slavery into the Territories, are with the Republicans, firmly and avowedly. Whether this prescriptive action will not increase the number of such remains, to be seen.
These people are intelligent-they have friends and associates. As I have said, they have wills of their own, hence it may be confidently expected that; they will not be slow in pouring forth their sorrows, into the bosoms of those friends, and striving for a, restoration of equal privileges. The Day Boot and (kindred prints are received here with affection, and, hospitality extended. No excommunication for them. Oh! No! Well, dear Tribune, what shall we do? Can you administer to the alleviation of our sufferings? Perhaps the Postmasters will have pity on our sufferings. They are good fellows, and don't want to do this thing. Should they, however, then shall we feel exceedingly tried with them, indeed; and you mast put us in the way of again seeing the light of your countenance by some other process. I hope they will relent; if they do not, then will not we sign their petitions when applying next Spring to be retained in office by the Great Republican Union Administration.
In your nominations at Chicago, give us either President or Vice President south of Mason and Dixon's line. Don't fail to do so. It should have been so in '56. The names of Cassius M. Clay, Henry Winter Davis, F. P. Blair, suggest themselves just now, and there are many others equally worthy. We are not very particular about men-principles are held in batter estimation here. 
Seward id esteemed somewhat in these sunny climes; bat only give as true men, and we on our part will give them a plumper or two, though attended with difficulties it may be. A REPUBLICAN.
N. B.-The Postmasters, as far as beard from, retain the papers. If they would only read them, it would be some consolation.
From the Cincinnati Gazette.
C. M. CLAY AND THE KENTUCKY RADICALS.
EDS. GAZETTE: In your paper for last week, I see the appeal of C. M. Clay to the people of Madison county, Ky. In this appeal, be renews his attack upon a class on the Anti-Slavery men who were co-workers in Kentucky. These he is pleased to style 'Radical Abolitionists,' and with these be I classes myself.
What is the amount of my Radicalism as given by Mr. Clay? He says, that of the 4th of July, (1856, I took the doctrine of the Radicals-'that there is no law for Slavery'-that as a citizen of the commonwealth, he (Fee) owed no allegiance to the Constitution and laws adopted and enforced on the subject of Slavery.'See his Frankfort speech.
The latter statement places me in a reckless attitude, which I have tried carefully to avoid; and the former is a mode of statement against which I have repeatedly protested, in person, by letter, and I by published replies. I now say, as I have said before, that in the sense of human enactment, there is law for Slavery; under it, I pay taxes, submit to it, advise no resistance, oppose all insurrection or rebellion.
My position, as then stated, and yet maintained is this: ' A LAW CONFESSEDLY contrary to the law of nature and of revelation ought not by human courts to be enforced. I drew the opinion from authorities confessedly high. I began the address by quoting the words of the framers of the Declaration of Independence: 'All men have certain inalienable rights'-' life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' I said, if 'inalienable,'' then governments themselves cannot alienate. To talk otherwise is to talk absurdities.
The next position was, that these rights were endowed by their Creator.' I said, if endowed by the Creator, then it is impious to attempt to take them away.
I showed that men of God, in Old and New Testament times, claimed that a law or enactment, confessedly contrary to the law of God, ought not to be enforced. I introduced the ease of the Heribrews, who refused to enforce the law of Pharaoh, requiring the men-children to be pot to death. To chattelize the image of God is as certainly wicked and impious as to take away life.
I attempted, farther, to sustain the Higher Law position, by quotations from jurists and statesmen:- 
'Upon the law of nature and revelation, all human laws depend. No human laws should be suffered to contradict these.'-Blackstone.
Again, 'No court is under obligation to enforce an unjust law; but on the contrary, every court is bound by prior and supreme obligation to refrain from enforcing such laws.'-{Gov. Chase-Van Zandt, argument before Supreme Court of United States.
I next referred to the speech of Hou Charles Sumner, in the Senate of the United States, on the Fugitive Slave Bill, in which he fathered the words of the Vermont Judge, Show me a bill of sale it from Almighty God; then, and not till then, will I give up the fugitive.
Then, or repeatedly since, I quoted the words of Mr. Clay, in his address in Philadelphia before the Board of Home Missions of the M. E. Church, in which he said Labor, then, and its proceeds, are his whose hands perform it. It is the most sacred of all property, and cannot be alienated by slaves are individuals, by any other rules than those which on govern the alienation or of other kinds of property.
<c06>
Slavery, then, cannot exist, except for crime, or by the voluntary consent of the enslaved.' I have never uttered anything more radical. I like the sentiment.
To this testimony in favour of the Higher Law, I might add that of Gov. Seward, in his speech on the admission of California, in which speech he claimed that there is a Higher Law, above all laws and constitutions.
What was the design of these men in the utterance of these Higher Law sentiments? Not revolution, but simply the utterance of a moral sentiment, that should gradually change public sentiment, that should gradually change public sentiment, strip the enactment of all moral prestige, and thus prepare the way for the peaceable repeal or disuse of the enactment.
By such utterances, the Black laws of Indians, in many portions of the State, like the Fugitive Slave law in many of the States if the Union, have fallen into disuse, and yet no revolution. When, therefore, Mr. Clay talks about our Higher Law position being revolutionary, it is to us pain; because it does him injustice, and improperly affects the mind of the unreflective. Our work is not revolution, but conversion. All know that we will suffer abuse and injury, rather than resort to violence. We should deprecate revolution even for slave. We do no think the result would be good to either black or white.
In the course of my remarks, on the occasion referred to, I said, I cannot obey the Fugitive Slave law- it is contrary to the law of God. What we do up to the least of Christ's brethren, we do unto him.
I next referred to the history of our Federal Constitution; showed that it was designed for freedom, and that in carrying out the Higher Law of God, we need not come in collision with this.
In reference to State laws, I introduced the admirable argument of Mr. Clay, made some fifteen years since, in which he shown ' that in all places where Congress had, or now has, exclusive control, where slavery did not previsously exist by the sovereign power of the thirteen States, there slavery does not and cannot exist.' The argument is, that where slave laws had extended over territory no ceded to the Federal Government, these laws 'became extinct by deed of cession'-that each slave became free by virtue of that clause of the fifth amendment which protects liberty-and that these persons, having been at one definite period free could not be debarred the right of habeas corpus and restoration to liberty, on the ground that the territory had become a sovereign State-once free, always free.
(See his writings, p.243-5.) I introduced this argument to show that whilst we held the Constitution as secondary, we yet did not contemn the Constitution, and that in carrying our the Higher Law, we need not necessarily come in conflict with it.
Mr. Clay claimed that 'whilst a law was on the statute book, it ought to be enforced and obeyed, until repealed by the Republican majority.'
I replied-this, as a general role, is correct-and I should urge respect for constitutions, and obedience to laws, not merely as a matter of expediency, but as a religious duty; until we should come in conflict with an enactment confessedly wicked and impious in its requirements: then I would say, such enactments ought not to be enforced-we should obey God rather than man.
Will Mr. Clay say otherwise? If not, let him cease his 'denunciation.' If he will say otherwise, then he will say courts ought to enforce confessed wickedness, and maintain practical atheism. This would destroy the validity of every oath; for if there be no higher law to be regarded, then there in no utility in an both-then there would be no standard for legislation or jurisprudence.
We took the position we did, not from partizan purposes, but because we felt that the state of public sentiment there demanded it, and that the true religion of Christ demanded it; for if Christians and others may disregard the authority of God in one thing, then for the same reason they may disregard his authority in all things.
In the course of Mr. Clay's remarks, he said, 'I would not obey the Fugitive Slave law myself. It is contrary to natural right, and I would mot degrade my nature by obeying it.'
In my next reply, I claimed that Mr. Clay had conceded the very point in debate.Here was a law upon the statute book, unrepealed by the Republican majority, and yet Mr. Clay says he will not obey it, and gives as his reason that ' it is contrary to natural right.' Mr.Clay talks about 'the laws being respected and enforced in good faith,' yet here is a law on the statute book, unrepealed by the Republican majority, which he will neither respect nor enforce.
Mr.Clay is like some other men-he will obey as a general rule, disobey as the exception. Let him, then, cease denouncing us. Also, he will fellowship in the Republican party, hundreds and thousands who entertain and express the same sentiments we have expressed.
I was then, as Mr. Clay tells the people of Madison, a member of the Republican Association of that county. I was, at the instigation of somebody, read off for my higher law sentiments. I had not claimed with radicals, that the Federal Government had power, under the Constitution, in times of peace, to abolish slavery in the States-so not now. I think there is a moral obligation on the whole nation to abolish slavery. I had not proposed the organization of any other party. Afterwards, when I saw the higher law of God virtually repudiated, as I thought, and that the party would probably go for the protection of slavery, I thought to try for another organization-did not, do not now propose any other, hoping to see and working to help the Republican party take right ground. If it shall go for the protection of slavery, then many will stand off, as before. But all Mr. Clay can complain of are our higher law sentiments; a part of our religious faith, which we deem it duty to carry into all the relations of life.
Had Mr. Clay gone along and made his speech, without stopping to ' denounce ' my position, the people would have found no fault, and the friends would not have been alienated. Or if he had said, 'I differ from Mr. Fee, but he violates no law, and as a teacher of righteousness, has a right to his sentiments-I will try to correct his errors by constitutional and righteous means-free speech-and which I award to him,'-then all would have been united, and the Slave Power restrained-not by force of arms, but by the prestige of numbers and social position.
Mr. Clay is generous and noble in many respects, is the friend of freedom, and did what he thought wisest. We think he erred, but that he should have free speech.
His persevering ' denunciation ' in speeches and newspaper articles has emboldened the enemy, and intimidated friends-weakened the enterprise. And no good is accomplished by this, but contrariwise. The spirit of proscription is growing even upon him. He has not only suggested that the Legislature of Kentucky could pass a law by which these Radicals or higher law men could be expelled from the State, but has volunteered his services to help do so, if the enactment could be passed. In princi

No blessing of the Union can be a compensation for taking part in the enslaving of our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to be perpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that it can only continue through our participation in wrong doing.

ple, how does this differ from the mob? The mob says, 'Fee, you shall not utter your sentiments here.' Mr. Clay says, 'Give me a paper enactment, and he shall not stay in the land of his birth,' though guilty of no crime but that of uttering higher law sentiments; and I believe him honest, and designing no violence. I would not do this to Cassius. What? suggest that such a man as Cassius M. Clay, a man who has toiled for the good of humanity as long as he has�suggest that an enactment be provided for the expulsion of such a man, and then volunteer to drive such an one from the State? I would rather be mobbed nine times more, and then driven as an exile from the State. The time will come, when Cassius will regret this. He has too much nobleness not to do so.
Much has been said about getting rid of the Radicals. Who are they? and where are they? So far as I know, every man driven from Kentucky had acted and voted with the Republican party, save two, and these besitated only because they feared that the party in '56 would, if inaugurated, protect of holding innocent men in bondage. They were co-workers in the Anti-Slavery cause, and had violated no law.
The others were in action and name Republicans, This is true, all the ministers and many other Christians were, of course, Higher Law men. In this, they sympathize with the Radicals and all others who hold up the authority of God's higher law. God will honor such.
Mobocrats care not for the difference between Republicans and Radicals. They mobbed me on the 4th of July, 1856, just as freely as after�so they mobbed Mr. Clay before, and hundreds of others since, who never said anything about higher law or Radicals. Mobocrats are united in opposition to all active opposers of slavery. In their esteem, as one of their numbers expresses it, in one of their meetings, 'the difference between a Republican and an Abolitionist is the difference between a pig and a Shoat, the one will soon grow to be the other.'
Of the thirteen or fourteen heads of families driven last week from Berea, not one was charged with being radical; all were Republicans. They were ordered to leave. After some days of deliberation, it was deemed best to let them slide. Two of them are now in this city. I think this was better than to have resisted. They did resist on the Monday previous, but were the next day overpowered. We think it was best quietly to come away. Though the sacrifice of feeling be great, the effect will be good. These outrages will only serve to show the true nature of slavery, and rouse good men to do their duty at the ballot box.
I have written thus much, not that I would willingly find fault with Mr. Clay, but because such repeated allusions to myself and others, and complaint on his part, is calculated to make the impression that a good; cause had been injured by recklessness and insubordination. Friends have insisted that I reply, and let the world judge.
JOHN G. FEE.
CINCINNATI, April 9, 1860.
From the Cincinnati 'World We Live In.'
CASSIUS M. CLAY AND THE BEREANS.
We do not like the course of C. M. Clay, in regard to his connection with the expulsion of the Bereans.
Before Rev. John G. Fee became an exile from Madison county, Mr. Clay was waited upon to see if he would not use his influence to prevent the expulsion of Mr. Fee, which had been previously determined upon.
It is reported to us that Mr. Clay, on this occasion, showed a bitterness towards Mr. Fee rivalling that of the mob itself. He refused assistance in any shape or manner, adding that Mr. Fee ought to have left Kentucky long before.
Again, in the late troubles in Madison county, Mr. Clay boasts that he had advised Hanson to leave.
Mr. Clay has announced, time after time, that he will defend al Republicans that believe as he does. But, if they are radical, (as he calls them,) he not only refuses to assist them, but he takes especial pains to publish the fact that he has advised such to leave Kentucky. He says that the doctrines held by Fee and Hanson have a tendency to render slave property insecure�that if there is no law for slavery, then the slaves will be encouraged to become insubordinate, and to withhold obedience to the master�that, as a majority have decided in favor of slavery, the laws tolerating the institution should be respected, and not held up to contempt.
But Mr. Clay himself regards the laws tolerating slavery as wrong. Does he then encourage insubordination and disobedience? If he teaches the people that a certain law is wrong, do not such teachings cause the people to have no re spect for the law? And how could he complain, (when he remembers the advice he gave about Fee and Hanson leaving Kentucky,) if his pro-slavery neighbors should say to him that his opinions are calculated to produce disturbance in the community, and that they have concluded to advise him to leave Kentucky�that a man holding his sentiments cannot live peaceably in their midst, and that, therefore, they give him timely notice that he must leave?
Had Mr. Clay, instead of notifying the public that he had advised Fee and Hanson to leave, proclaimed in ringing words that these men had violated no law, and that, therefore, they had the same right to live in Kentucky that he or any other man had, his position would-have been far better, and he would have stood infinitely higher in the estimation of all true Republicans.
Since writing the above, our eyes have lit upon the following. It seems that the Chicago Press and Tribune does not admire the position which Mr. Clay occupies any better than we do:�
'We do not like Cassius M. Clay's Appeal. It is not what we expected�not what we had a right to expect, from that courageous and self-sacrificing friend of human rights. By implication, if not directly, it sanctions the lawlessness of the mob that despoiled the peaceful church at Berea, and drove John G. Fee and his brethren out of the State. As we understand it, Mr. Fee was punished for his opinions�not his acts.
He believed that human slavery had no foundation in law; and that theoretical conviction was the offence. For it, he was driven off. Mr. Clay says he could not defend him. We ask, why not? He had a right to his opinions, and opinions have never been punishable in this country. Since the time of the old Sedition Law of John Adams down to the date of Mr. Douglas's inquisitorial scheme, by which the principle of the old law was revived, nobody ha presumed to arraign conscience in court for its convictions. As a citizen, then, Mr. Fee was guiltless. We did not expect that gallant defender of free thought and free speech could admit that Mr. Fee had justly suffered. The right to have and hold such opinions as education, conscience or association may develop is sacred; and when Mr. Clay admits that right can be narrowed in the least, lawfully or unlawfully, by a logical conclusion he ought not to complain when his opinions, more moderate than those of his former friends, are made the excuse for inflicting upon him the punishment Mr. Fee has endured. In reference to this right, there can be no concession, no compromise.
"It is vital in all reforms�the very root of all progressive movements."'

IN PRISON, U. S. CUSTOM HOUSE.
MILWAUKEE, April 18th, 1860.
To the Editors of the Free Democrat:
I wish no one, friend or foe, to be deceived in regard to my position. I have uniformly held one language toward all. My imprisonment is an outrange upon both law and justice, and is the grossest insult to the soverginity of the State and the rights of all its citizens. Were I the richest man in Wisconsin I would not pay my fine, nor would not pay my fine, nor would I be guilty of the hypocrisy of asking pardon for an act which I should do again, in like circumstances, and for which, instead of a prison, I deserve the thanks of all liberty-loving men. By the law of this State, and the judgment of its highest Court, I am a free man, guilty of no offence, and I have a right to claim its protection. I am here for the vindication of a principle, and I shall remain here till the U. S. Government, ashamed of its oppression, discharges me, or the State interposes for my relief, or till die people, despairing of protection for their own liberties if such outrages are permitted upon their charity rights, shall vindicate the insulted majesty of Freedom and the violated sovereignty of the State, by putting a forcible end to kidnapping in Wisconsin. And if neither the government of the nation nor of the State, nor, in case of their continued neglect, the people, are ready to issue a writ for my release, I can afford to wait in prison, a living exam-
<c02>
ple of the mockery of State Sovereignty and Freedom in Wisconsin, till the people learn that the rights and liberties of one citizen cannot be sacrificed to the despotism of Slavery without endangering liberties of all.
Yours for the Right,
S. M. BOOTH. 

LETTER FROM MR. SHERMAN M. BOOTH, 
Correspondence of the N. Y. Tribune:
IN PRISON, UNITED STATES CUSTOM HOUSE }
MILWAUKEE, April 5th, 1860.
As questions of great public interest are likely to grow out of my re-arrest and confinement on the old sentence, from which I have once been discharged, allow me a place in the Tribune to state the outlines an f the case. Joshua Glover, an alleged fugitive on slave, was rescued from the Milwaukee County Jail on the 11th of March, 1854; and for this rescue I was arrested a few days afterward, and after a lengthy examination I was held to bail by United states Commissioner Winfield Smith, in the sum of & $2,000. I afterward surrendered myself, and obtained a writ of habeas corpus of the Hon. A. P. Smith, one of the Justices of the Supreme Court, who, after a full bearing, discharged me, on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the Fugitive act. An appeal was taken from this decision of one of the Justices, to the full Bench, and the majority affirmed Justice Smith's opinion. The Grand Jury of the United States District Court, at the same time, indicted me simply for aiding one Joshua Glover to escape, without alleging that he was a fugitive slave or a 'person held to service or labor,' and I was arrested on this indictment the day after I was discharged by the Supreme Court. I offered de the same bail I had before given�one of our first citizens, who was ready to justify in twenty times the sum demanded; but the Court refused him, because he had before surrendered me to enable me to procure a writ of habeas corpus. I declined to give '. other bail, went to jail, asked for another writ of the Supreme Court, which was refused on the ground of comity�the Supreme Court stating that they were bound to believe that the United States District Court, on hearing the case, would discharge me. The excitement at the refund of the writ was great. The Federal officers became frightened, offered to take the same bail they had previously refused, and urged me to come out of jail; and after three days imprisonment I went at large again. At the January term of the United States District Court, the prosecution dismissed the first indictment, and brought in a new one, accusing me, in addition to the original charge, of resisting the United States officers in the execution of process. After a week's trial I was found guilty of aiding the escape of Glover, and not guilty of resisting United States process. A motion for a new trial, on the ground, sustained by the affidavits of eight responsible men, that some of the jurors who convicted me had repeatedly declared, previous to my trial, that I ought to be convicted, we overruled, and I was sentenced, of on the 23d of January, to one month's imprisonment and to pay $1,000 fine and $461.01 costs, and to stand committed till the fine one costs were paid, After being seven days in jail, I was taken to Madison, before the Supreme Court, on a writ of habeas corpus, for which I had again applied, and on the 3d day of February, 1855, I was discharged from the sentence and judgment�Justice Crawford, who held to the constitutionality of the Fugitive Act, concurring in the discharge, on the ground that there was no offence under that act charged against me in the indictment; Joshua Glover not being alleged in the indictment to be either a 'fugitive slave' or a 'person held to service or labor,' and not being proved to be such a fugitive person, he must be held to be a free man, and to aid his escape from slaveholders was no offence. 
The Supreme Court refused to send up the papers to the U. S. Supreme Court, or in other words refused to make any return to the writ of error, holding that the writ of habeas corpus was a writ original with the States, and that their proceedings under it were not subject to a review by the U. S. Supreme Court. But the Court, at Washington, assumed or usurped jurisdiction, without the original papers, and having obtained a copy of them, proceeded, after several years delay, to review the case, reversed the decision of our Supreme Court, and sent down to it a remittitur requiring it to reverse its former decision, affirm that of the U. S. District Court and remand me to imprisonment. Thin our Court refused to do, adhering to its former decision, and denying the appellate jurisdiction of the U. S. Supreme Court over their proceedings. 
Now what was the proper course for the Court at Washington to pursue, if it wished to enforce its decision? Clearly, to attack the Supreme Court at Wisconsin, and compel it to obey. This was its right and duty, if its decision was right. But it did nothing of the sort. But, Attorney-General Black sent instructions to the V. S. District-Attorney of Wisconsin, D. A. J. Upham, to have me arrested and imprisoned, without any regard to the decision of our Supreme Court, and went so far as to dictate the form of the warrant of recommitment for our District Judge. Accordingly, on the 1st of March last, I was arrested on my way from the railroad depot to my house, on my return from Madison. I had gone round, anticipating an arrest, for two or three months, but, having come to the conclusion that it was not intended to put the threats which had been made into execution, I had laid aside my revolvers some two weeks previous, and was consequently unarmed. The Deputy Marshal arresting me, told me he supposed it was a mere matter' of form, that I should; have the free access to counsel and friends, and every facility for getting out a writ of habeas corpus; that the Marshal would make a show of resistance, and then yield, and that be presumed I would not be restrained of my liberty over a day or two. But after I had reached the Marshal's room, in the Custom-House, and the key was turned on me, he refused to let me see counsel, or any one save his officers, and repudiated the pledges of his Deputy. Twice, subsequently, I was allowed to see counsel alone a few minutes�not occupying ten minutes at a time�and since then he has peremptorily refused to allow counsel to see me in regard to my case, and for nearly two weeks past he has refused to allow me to see my wife or any friends, or to have any books or newspapers, t have been treated wiih great capriciousness, and never know to-day what change may occur to-morrow. For nearly two weeks a large three-light gas chandelier was left burning part of the time with a full head of gas on all night, shining directly into my eyes, and every fifteen minutes during the night a roan with heavy tread turned the key, opened the door, and walked in to see if I had not fled. Of course, sleep in such circumstances, was next to impossible. Then the tables were turned, and the gas all turned off at 9 P. M. The day after election it was made a dungeon, all light being excluded, but in the afternoon the gas was lighted. I am now not permitted to see the light of day, my keepers being evidently anxious to give me an idea of slavery. Some of the time I have had eight or ten men, armed to the teeth, guarding me, with one hundred stands of arms, belonging to the U. S. Revenue Cutter Michigan, lying loaded and primed on tables in the room fronting mine, with any number of boarding weapons commingled. At present there are a great many, the Custom House being turned into a U. S. barracks. A terrible fear of rescue seems to possess them. My chief under-keeper is a man named King, from Pennsylvania, who was a recruiting officer for the Lopez 'Expedition to Cuba, and boated to me that be had enlisted 2.000 of their piratical filibusters in the Atlantic States. The kidnapping business comes natural to him, and the Marshal, in electing his assistant, recognized the fitness of things. 
My application for a writ of habeas corpus from the Supreme Court, as you are well aware, failed by a tie vote�Justice Paine declining to act, because be had been counsel for me at another stage of the same case, five year ago. I was apprehensive of such a result, and would have preferred to ask a writ of our County Judge, but deferred to the judgment of others, who were confident Justice Paine would act in the ease, and who thought the moral effect of a writ from the Supreme Court would be greater than if it came from a County Court. But this does not preclude the granting of a writ by any other Court, and I understand a writ was served on the Marshal, yesterday, from Racine County, returnable in twenty-four hours. He, of course, will return that he holds me by virtue of a final judgment and sentence of the United States District Court, and refuse to produce me. And then will come the collision. One side or the other must yield. 
Had been ready to pay the fine and costs I could have gone free the 18th of March. By the law of Wisconsin, authoritatively expounded, I am free, and I want to know whether the State is able and willing to protect the liberty of its citizens. If it gives me no protection, I owe it no allegiance.
<c03>
I could not ask the President's pardon for an act of Christian duty, which I should perform again in like circumstances. And so, if relief comes not from the State, and the Government sees fit to continue my imprisonment, because I cannot consciously pay my fine, and let my fellow-prisoner, John Rycraft, go at large�though be was convicted the same offence, and discharged the same time I was�the public will understand that it is not Justice, but vengeance, that it seeks, for labors to overthrow the Slave Power, and I shall wait patiently the incoming of another Administration for my release. Allow me to say here, that the various rescue-suits have cost me, in addition to what has been contributed for that purpose, over $800, beside more than six months' time, a great deal of annoyance, and, to this date, nearly two months' imprisonment.
There is still another outrage proposed�that of removing me to Mackinaw, out of this State�to which I wish to call public attention. If the Federal Government may remove a prisoner out of the State and District in which the offence was committed, in to another State or District, after conviction, to prison him, why may it not remove him before al, to convict him? And if it may remove me to Mackinaw, it may remove me to Charleston or New leans, and may remove any obnoxious person in New England, or the Northern States, to the Southern States, to try and imprison them at its will, ill the people of this country submit to such an outrage? They will if they tolerate it in my case, and this will be a precedent for future cases. When is same matter was first moved, in my case, five are ago, our Judges and statesmen said, 'It cannot be done;' it is against all law and precedent; 'it would prove a revolution.' But despotism has made great progress in this country, in e last five years, and there is no act of tyranny which the Slave Power may not commit to carry it its plans. I only wish to warn my countrymen, at when I am removed to another State, to be I imprisoned there by a mandate from the Federal Government, if the people submit to it, practically the days of liberty in this Republic are numbered. Some of the forms of liberty may remain, but the substance will be wanting.

The Liberator

NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
BOSTON, MAY 11, 1860.
REMOVAL.
The office of the MASSACHUSETTS ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY, and also that of the LIBERATOR, have been removed from 21 Cornhill to the Washington Building, 221 Washington Street, directly opposite Franklin Street�third story. The change of position is a very desirable one, and the accommodations are more spacious and agreeable.

NEW TRUTH WITH OLD FALSEHOOD IN THE INDEPENDENT. 

The New York Tribune, speaking of the newspaper press of the South and West, uses this expression respecting the technically ' religious' portion of it:�
'We are sorry to say that we have found the secular papers, in the cheap qualities of good nature, common sense and veracity, far in advance of those which are printed avowedly for the promotion of the Christian religion.'
This, certainly, is strong language; but the large experience of the editor of the Tribune, added to his freedom from sectarian bias, gives much weight to this opinion; and why should we hesitate to believe it, when we see that the same characteristics in the Independent do not interfere with its popularity, or cause its readers to demand a practice corresponding with its professions of piety. A long course of impunity in falsehood has emboldened the editors of that paper of trifle, more and more, with the credulity of their readers, and to expect implicit belief, even when they have furnished the means, to a carefully observant reader, for the detection of their falsehood. There is, however, a tide in the affairs of men, and when the enormous falseness of their course has once begun to be recognized by their readers, the extent and profusion of its evidences will make the process of disenchantment a rapid one. At present, trusting to a continuance of implicit confidence in their own statements, they seem to rely mainly on the frequent repetition of these, with a suppression and misrepresentation of opposing testimony.
In the course of a recent attempt to fix the stigma of infidelity upon Mr. Garrison, (as the most effective means of neutralizing his exposures of the complicity with slavery maintained by their churches,) the editors of the Independent asked�'What is an infidel in the common meaning of that word?'�evidently thinking that the foundation of deceit which they have long been laying, is now strong enough to bear the superstructure of deceit designed for it.
The conductors of the 'religious' press, (so called,) taking advantage of that divoice of reason from theology and religion which they represent as essential to the full success of their theological system, have so long practised a misuse and perversion of the language belonging to this subject, as now to be able confidently to appeal to a false meaning which has become, among their readers, the common meaning' of the words in question.
For instance: it is very important to that class of clergymen to which the editors of the Independent belong, to fix some stigma upon the character of those who have sufficient regard for the honor of God and the welfare of men to discredit their theory respecting the irrevocable eternal continuance in sin and misery, of ail who, on reaching the boundary of this mortal life, are not prepared to enter immediately upon perfect holiness and happiness. Of all who disbelieve this theory, the Reverend calumniators in question have been accustomed to say that�They deny the doctrine of future retribution! Thus not only assuming the absurdity that the former of these implies the latter�that there can be no future retribution apart from 'hell'�but uttering this calumny in face of the fact that the persons thus accused had always taught an exact and thorough system of future retribution, namely, God's system, that all sin, alike in this world and the next, must inevitably produce evil and suffering to the sinner, the experience of which urges, with cumulative force, towards repentance and reformation. 
Other specimens of this deliberate perversion of language are found in the words 'blasphemy' and 'infidelity,' which have been so systematically misused by the pulpit and the 'religious' press, that not one in ten of their hearers and readers uses either of these word's in its proper signification, or is able to state its exact meaning when called upon. And so assured does the Independent feel that its false interpretation is inextricably affixed to the word infidelity, that it not only ventures to appeal to this as the common meaning,' but to quote the materially different true meaning from Webster's dictionary, and declare its perversion justified by that also, trusting that the faith of its readers will mislead even their eyesight.
In another column will be found a letter, written by Wendell Phillips, Esq., for insertion in the Independent. The less important part of this letter appeared in that paper last week, with a deceptive caption, representing it as a mere eulogy upon Mr. Garrison by his friend and fellow-laborer. The more important part, namely, a remonstrance to the editors of the Independent respecting the double injustice which they have long been accustomed to commit against Mr. Garrison�the repetition of statements utterly false, and the insinuation of other charges by language carefully adapted, and evidently designed, to mislead their readers�was suppressed; and not only suppressed, but (according to their custom) misrepresented in their editorial columns. 
The editors of the Independent said that the portion of Mr. Phillips's letter which they allowed their readers to see was 'extracted' from it. It was so, just
<c04>
as a tooth is 'extracted' by a dentist; that is to say, it was wrenched and torn from its natural situation and connections, so that those who read it in the Independent could see but half its force and appropriateness.
The reading of this letter, however, has produced one note-worthy effect upon the Reverend gentlemen, having caused them to retract one particular lie in of which they have persevered for a long course of years, in spits of much remonstrance from friends anxious for the credit of their paper. This is their declaration, never before disavowed, that Mr. Garrison was 'an infidel of a most degraded class.' Of this they now say, (after a detail of circumstances which may or may not be true, for the editors of the of independent have long since lost the right to have their word received as the representative of facts) 'So far then at the editors of this journal are concerned, the appearance of such an expression in our columns was an oversight; and the application of it to Mr. Garrison is not justified by anything that we have ever known of that gentleman.' 
It appears that 'oversight' is the modern evangelical' term for the particular immorality in question. If there were any doubt whether the days of miracle were past, this fact would settle it, that the penalty of 'oversights' is no longer what it was in he time of Ananias and Sapphira. For, if we reckon one 'oversight' for each week that the Independent; has left its calumny above-mentioned unretracted, the number will amount to many hundreds, and yet its editors continue in good (bodily) health.
When the villain, in Schiller's 'Robbers,' at last defeated and ruined, prays in despair�'O Lord, help me this once, for Thou knowest I have not troubled. Thee with many petitions!'�the honest steward exclaims in horror�'Good heavens! even his prayers; are sins!' I regret to be obliged to say that even, this retraction of a calumnious falsehood, by the editors of the Independent, seems to be only under constraint, from the force of Mr. Phillips's representation, and to be unaccompanied by either repentance or amendment. In the same article they seat other! false statements, other malignant insinuations. The lapse of time and the change of tide will bring other. changes, as it has brought the one just mentioned. And by and by, when the readers of the Independent shall have made acquaintance with Mr. Garrison by, reading or hearing him, and thus be assured of the gross and utter falseness of the statement that he sneers, or ever did sneer, at the Bible, the editors of that paper will hasten to represent that too as 'an oversight'; a statement not justified by anything that they had ever known of him.�C.K.W.

THE 'INFIDELITY OF WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON.
LETTER TO THE INDEPENDENT.
'BY WENDELL PHILLIPS.
To the Independent:
Will you allow me a place in your columns? I observe that one of your editors calls my honored friend, Mr. Garrison, 'an infidel.' His character, place in history, and eminent services to our age are now too well settled and recognized to need further assertion or any defence, This attempt to make him odious, pitiable in itself, takes fresh ridicule from its laughable parade of Dictionaries to settle the meaning of a word about whose signification, as your editor shows, all the Dictionaries differ, and which has no definite meaning, any more than 'short' and; 'tall,' large' and 'little,' but takes its color from the position of the speaker. Originally meant, probably, to designate Mohammedans and Pagans, it now, at, Rome, includes all Protestants, and, at London, more than half of us; while for popular use, for all, as your editor confesses, except 'those well read in the history of opinions, and intelligent in the use of language,' it stigmatizes the low, sensual and selfish foe of all religious sentiment and belief, 'the blasphemy of Voltaire and the debauchery of Paine,' as he chooses to phrase it. After allowing this, your editor still persists in its use. Is the Independent, then, (edited by one man, at least, who cannot understand an English sentence,) published only for men who sit with Ritter's and Cousin's 'Histories of Opinions' in their hands, Webster's Dictionary on one side, and Worcester's on the other? Or, pledged to speak not as pleasing men, but God,' has it so little sympathy [with one of the most laborious and unselfish of the servants of our age that, with lazy indifference, it 'speaks' of him in words which, it allows, more than half its readers must misunderstand? Using an epithet which, in controversy, every candid man avoids, mindful that as 'Orthodoxy means my doxy, and Heterodoxy means another man's dozy,' so Fidelity (to coin a word) means believing as the speaker does, and Infidelity is disagreeing with him; an epithet which your editor insists on using solely to fix unmerited odium on the object of his hatred�being one whom it is yet safe and gainful to misrepresent�well knowing, and throughout his articles showing that he knows, that the simple statement of the real truth, that he and Mr. Garrison differ as to the inspiration of the Scriptures, would bring no odium at all. A lie is the use of words which you know your reader will misunderstand. How long shall theological hate' keep the unenviable preeminence of being the most unscrupulous of all? What were Mr. Garrison's words? 
'We commend this [Dr. Cheever's] work to all who profess to revere the Scriptures; at the same time protesting against making the rights of man to depend upon any parchment whatever.'
No candid man, competent for the service of a public journal, would ever infer from these words that Mr. Garrison did not profess to revere the Scripture,' or was an infidel, denying 'the divine origin of Christianity.' Your editor would never dare or dream to say of Moses Stuart that he did not 'revere the Scriptures,' and was an 'infidel,' though it would be hard to class his creed under any theory of Plenary, or any other, Inspiration. No man can point to word or act of Mr. Garrison which denies the divine origin of Christianity. On the contrary, his whole life and utterance have been one sublime confession of his faith therein.
I do not, however, come with Dictionaries,, doubled down in dog's ears,' to contest this epithet ('infidel') with one who, judged by his criticism of Mr. Garrison's language, needs a conscience or grammar far more than a Dictionary. But you may remember that though Salem's idea of witchcraft, in 1692, is of no consequence in a scientific point of view, till the antiquary values it as an excellent test of the intelligence and humanity of Salem at that time. In the same way, by recalling some of the prominent traits of Mr. Garrison's character and career, we shall get this writer's notion of an infidel of a most degraded doss,' and thus provide ourselves with an accurate test of his intelligence and Christianity a matter of no consequence, to be sure, except in so far as your editor, standing in your columns and reiterating this charge from year to year, uncontradicted by his associates, may be considered to represent the opinion of the Independent.
[The foregoing paragraphs the Independent refused to publish. To those which follow it gave place.]
Who, then, is William Lloyd Garrison The most hated man in all .America, upon whom the malignant eyes of twenty million of people have been fastened for thirty years. But, though living under such a crutiny, and while press and pulpit have vented without stint the grossest misrepresentation of his. purposes and creed, no lip has yet been found <illegible> enough to breathe a doubt of the spotless purity of his private life; or to suspect that he acts, or as. 'sins from acting, speaks or keeps silence, from fear of man, love of gain, or desire of applause. Utter uprightness, honest intention, transparent sincerity, fearlessness in speaking his own thoughts, and entire
<c05>
willingness that every other man's should be heard: a life of ceaseless and unselfish toil for others�these have never been denied him. And all this, so much say of any roan, seems so trifling and negative a merit, side by side with his eminent services and brave life, that hardly any one takes note of it. 
Temperance is the watchword of the first, and one the hardest battles which this generation has been led to fight. On how many a Christian profession has it written 'Ichabod'�while the world, well owing the fierceness of the struggle, has pitied the conquered almost as much as it condemned him. In the bloom of his youth, (1827,) we find Mr. Garrison the editor of the first paper devoted to the principle of total abstinence, at a time when hardly one pulpit had wakened to this sin of intemperance. Ever since then, he has stood the consistent and devoted servant of this hard reform.
'OVERCOME EVIL WITH GOOD' is the lesson of the Cross. From boyhood we find this man braving a corrupt public opinion at every sacrifice, shrinking from no peril, yet, when plundered, assaulted, mobbed, pursued with foul and relentless libels for thirty years, never seeking defence by violence or damages law, but bearing patiently the scorn of pulpit and press, and charged even with infidelity for his non-resistance�for being willing, when smitten on the right cheek, to turn the other also. But meanwhile he was the leader whose company was publicly saved by Dr. Channing, 'in the name of freedom and humanity,' as having 'saved the right of free speech.'
In a nation calling itself Christian, when every sixth man was a slave, and every sixth woman was doomed to prostitution by law, and while all men cowered in the belief that they could not safely' change this state of things, he was the first to trust in God that it was safe to do right, and to preach the duty of IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION. His was the, heart so divinely touched as to be first to waken this sin, and to speak God's rebuke. My sheep hear my voice.' Your face may reflect sunlight on block or marble without effect for three-score years and ten; but let it fall once on the prepared metal, and your likeness is there forever.
A devoted attendant, at that time, on the services of the church, he seeks at once, with undoubting trust, her aid. Several of the Boston ministers listen to his statement and wishes. Worse than priest and Levite, passing by on the other side, they join the thieves to strip, wound and leave him half dead. Undaunted, alone, he resolves, ' I will not equivocate, I will not retract, I will not retreat a single inch, and I will be heard.' Young, steeped in poverty to the very lips, yet full of talent, and able to have carved out for himself a career as easy and successful as the editor of the Tribune, with no greater ability and in the same path, has done, he devotes himself disinterestedly to the help of the slave; living on bread and water, and sleeping beneath his printing forms, that he may have wherewith to preach to a besotted nation the gospel of humanity and justice. The envious pulpit, rebuked by his fidelity, spits at him its continual venom. He answers year by year only with entreaty and appeal, hopeful and trusting that soon the Christianity of the land will rally to his side. Slowly, with sad reluctance, he sees his mistake, and girds himself to rebuke the pretenders whom he had mistaken for servants of the Master whose footsteps he seeks to follow.
The most familiar book to his lips is the Bible, and the first suspicion of infidelity he excites comes from his asserting that the ' Book of books,' as he calls it, does not sanction human bondage, while the whole Church, through the lips of Andover and Princeton, asserts that it does.
In all these pure and Christian labors, he seeks no aid against slavery and intemperance but that of enlightened reason and a Christian conscience; appeals only to the highest motives; attacks slavery as a SIN, hateful to God, and as such, calls on men to quit it; holds the standard of moral purity and rigid right so high that a grave Senator derides him as 'too�virtuous,' amid the plaudits of his fellow church-members; resigns his vote and his chance of civil place and office from a scrupulous delicacy of conscience, which the careless ethics of the pulpit deem Quixotic. Holding up the most unpopular and momentous cause that our age has stirred, instead of aid from organizations that call themselves Christian, their opposition, rebuke, slander and violence have dogged his steps. The most Christ-like man of the age, tested by his spirit and labors�engaged in those tasks which alone save our faith, here and now, from the well deserved scorn of the unbeliever�will be truly known only when history digs out his character from beneath the lies with which professed Christians have cumbered and blocked his path.
Reckless aspirants mount into office by calling him fanatic; well-fed pulpits keep the favor of their rich pews by denouncing him as an 'infidel.' Heedless of both, he holds on his even way till, at length, God gives him the seal of his apostleship, and an awakened nation girds itself to its duty.
'And John answered him, saying. Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us; and we forbade him, because he followeth not us.
But Jesus said,�Forbid him not: for there is no man WHICH SHALL DO A MIRACLE IN MY MAME, that can lightly speak evil of me.'�Mark ix. 38, 39.
Mr. Garrison called the Tribune into being with one hand, and the Independent with the other. The first, planted in the soil of his labors and grown rich from the dew with which he has watered it, has yet to give him the first fitting word of acknowledgment or respect; and the last still persists in denouncing that heart and brain which dug both it and the nation out of the New York Observer, as 'an infidel of a most degraded class'; while the heartiest recognition of the services of both to the slave's cause could be called from the generous pen of the man they malign.
A man of peace, hated of the world because testifying of its evil�seeking not his own�instant in season and out of season about his Father's business remembering the fatherless and the widow, and keeping himself unspotted from the world�taking no thought for the morrow, but busy in life-long, untiring and unselfish toil for the highest interests of his fellow-men�with a serene faith that bates no jot of hope in the darkest hour�merciful, pure in heart, a peace-maker, and earning another blessing of the 'Mount,' since men revile and persecute, and say all manner of evil of him falsely for Christ's sake�moulding all who approach him to a kindred self-denial and devotedness, and filling them with a profound interest in all that tends to make men purer, happier and better�his labors crowned with a success which only God on his side could give-he breathes a spirit which leads him to say of the Bible:�
'To no other volume do I turn with so much interest; no other do I consult or refer to so frequently; to no other am I so indebted for light and strength; no other is so identified with the growth of human freedom and progress; no other have I appealed to so effectively in aid of the various reformatory movements which I have espoused; and it embodies an amount of excellence so great as to make it. in my estimation, THB BOOK OF BOOKS.'�Garrison's Writings, p. 229.
Is this the language of Infidelity? Read, too, the reverent lines in which he has expressed his thought of 
THE TRUE CHURCH.
'CHURCH of the living God! in vain thy foes
Make thee, in impious mirth, their laughing-stock.
Contemn thy strength, thy radiant beauty mock:
In vain their threats, and impotent their blows�
Satan's assaults�Hell's agonizing throes!
For thou art built upon th' Eternal Rock,
Nor fear'st the thunder-storm, the earthquake shock.
And nothing shall disturb thy calm repose.
All human combinations change and die,
Whate'er their origin, name, form, design;
But, firmer than the pillars of the sky.
Thou standest ever by a power divine;
<c06>
Thou art endowed with Immortality,
And canst not perish�GOD'S OWN LIFE IS THINK!�
(Garrison's Writings, p. 115.)
Read, too, the following confession of his Christian Faith:�

IV.
"What is before me, Lord, is known to thee;
To me all is unknown, except thy will,
That I in all things should obedient be,
Come weal or woe, come present good or ill�
Nor fear those who the body only kill.
Thy will is mine, and let thy will be done!
Thy light and love my spirit sweetly fill:
Following with zeal the footsteps of thy Son,
With martyrs I rejoice the Christian race to run
V.
'E'en to this hour, to public gaze I stand,
An object feared, rejected, and abhorred;
And for my labors to redeem the land,
Reproach and infamy are my reward:
But time shall justice unto me accord.
To him who, for thy sake, takes up his cross,
Thy promises are rich and sure, O Lord!
Fire from th' adulterate ore extracts but dross,
But the pure gold sustains, and can sustain, no loss.
VI.
'Courage, O friends! a thousand fields are won!
Ten thousand foes lie prostrate in the dust!
Your task, though onerous, is nearly done;
Still in the LORD JEHOVAH be your trust,
And victory crowns you, for your cause is just.'
(Garrison's Writings, p.371.)
[Here the Independent rested, meanly refusing to print what follows.]
Bitter enemies of Mr. Garrison will allow all I have claimed. Now, if such a man, the writer of what I have quoted, is an 'infidel,' how shall we paint a Christian? If Webster's Dictionary can tell us�and he seems the ultimate and infallible authority of your editor�and a Christian be as he says:�' A real disciple of Christ: one who believes in the truth of the Christian religion, and studies to follow the example and obey the precepts of Christ; a believer in Christ who is characterized by real piety;' how few lives would as well answer this description? If, indeed, as your editor has discovered in his last article, many of these traits are often exhibited by those who really do not believe in the divine origin of Christianity�if one dowered with all these virtues and crowned with all these graces is, after all, no Christian, pray where is the need of being one, and what is the use of Christianity? Taught by the Bible, long before the light of the Independent dawned on me, that 'the tree is known by its fruit,' and that 'every good gift, and every perfect gift, is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights,' I cannot, as a Christian, afford to allow that such grapes as these grow on is fidel thorns. I honor JOHN CALVIN, sympathizing with him in the disgust he doubtless feels for many who take his name; and, for that very reason, I protest against bringing a dry, leafless tree of mere Calvinistic doctrine, with a New York or South-side Doctor of Divinity snugly perched on its topmost bough, into comparison with this luxuriant pride of the orchard, bending under ripe fruit. Pope, I think, asks 'what must be the priest where a monkey is the God!' Let me change the question and ask, 'what must be the pulpit in whose sight the man I have sketched is an; infidel of a most degraded class'?
Shall we seek our ideal of Christianity in a pulpit whose 'manhood is melted into courtesies'; whose pews eloquent and unscrupulous attorneys seek on Sunday as a 'place of rest, sure never to be reminded of their day's work'; whose conscience, like that of the timid neutral in Cromwell's time.
�'is a thing
That troubles neither Church nor King';
whose gospel is preached in New Orleans without making a ripple, and is one that rum sellers delight to honor; which, like the Jesuit, 'lengthens the creed and shortens the Decalogue'; which claims to have educated for us two generations, speaking with such 'bated breath and whispered humbleness' that to-day we stand without sufficient mercantile integrity to manage our great moneyed corporations, or law enough to punish the plunderers; with statesmen who do not even pretend to vindicate the morality of the Constitution which they swear to uphold, and a nation which, making right an appendage to expediency, and patriotism a mantle for plunder, is madly in love with the vilest system of slavery the sun ever saw? Such a pulpit calls Garrison an 'infidel of a most degraded class.'
In the sixteenth century the Pope excommunicated Luther, and Luther excommunicated the Pope. The startled crowd doubtless thought the Pope's word, seated as he was in a pulpit and dressed in canonicals, was both the first death and the second to the poor monk; and when Luther retorted, they trembled at what seemed his blasphemy. But to-day we see that the Pope's excommunication was mere angry noise, and that Luther's was the voice of God.

NEW PUBLICATIONS.
THOMAS PAINE: A CELEBRATION. Delivered in the First Congregational Church, Cincinnati, Ohio, Jan.29th, 1860: by M.D.Conway, Minister of the Church.�pp. 15. Cincinnati, 1860.
A celebration of the birth-day of Thomas Paine, held in a Congregational church, and an address delivered on that occasion by the minister of that church, are certainly novel and remarkable circumstances. That have tempted me to read the pamphlet named above, to which the name of its hero would have proved no attraction whatever.
This pamphlet speaks of Thomas Paine as having been introduced by Benjamin Franklin to John Adams, Benjamin Rush, and George Washington, and having been not only the valued friend and efficient coadjutor of these men in the struggle that gained American Independence, but their prompter at its commencement; the suggested, to them, of the very idea of seeking Independence. It represents the historians Ramsay, Gordon and others, as unanimous in their opinion that Paine's book, 'Common Sense,' was the primary cause of the aim and result to which the Revolution was guided. It represents the half-starved and more than half-discouraged soldiers of Washington as having been stimulated to win the battle of Trenton, the Keystone of the Arch of Revolution, by the burning words of Paine's second book, 'The Crisis;' its opening sentence having been made the watchword of that battle, and Washington himself having set the pen of Paine above any sword wielded that day. And it rehearse there honorable proofs of the public recognition of his merit, that, after his subsequent labors for the deliverance of France from its tyranny, Jefferson sent a government ship thither to invite him to our shores, Washington invited him to share Mount Vernon with him, and Barlow described him as 'one of the most benevolent and disinterested of mankind.'
So much for Paine's early life, as a lover of political liberty, and an earnest worker for it. But the pamphlet goes on to speak as follows of his subsequent career, and of other parts of his character.
'All efforts to stain, the good name of Thomas Paine have recoiled on those who made them, like poisoned arrows shot against a strong wind. In the name of priests and tract-societies, miserable men have come forward to cast mire upon him; but their retributions have been swift and terrible. Great Thorburn, who was set up to prove Paine's intemperance, has only succeeded in uncovering a mean that of his own early life; and Mr. Cheetham, who lifted his fang to strike the whiteness of his purity, was even in the godly city of Philadelphia, before a judge and jury who hated Paine, convicted and sentenced for slander and libel against the dead hero and a living and noble woman. Paine's old friend, Elizabeth Ryder, at whose house he boarded during all the period in which he is said to have been dissipated, and whose honesty is an unimpeached as her means of knowledge, comes forward to a Justice, and, with nearly her last words on earth, brands the pious falsehood. The Hero's fame has run the gauntlet of every slander which priestcraft and bigotry could spawn.

and has come forth untarnished; a thousand sanctified and clerical reputations have fallen at his side, and ten thousand at his right hand, but the pestilence which walketh in darkness could not fix its plague-spot on that honest and just mans name.
The pamphlet quotes this statement of Paines religious belief from his own words:-
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life. I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
And it adds-
He always honored Christ as a pure and elevated man, who taught a perfect morality, and who took into his side a fetal sheaf of the arrows of Ignorance and Selfishness, to break a pass for human souls through the ranks of priestcraft and tyranny into the realm of Liberty of mind and conscience. In all his writings, not one disrespectful word to Christ has ever been or can be found!
The ideas contained in these quotations are entirely new to me. My notions of Thomas Paine have been derived solely from the writings of the clergy, and the publications of the American Tract Society. Assuming that their representations of the man and his books were just, I took for granted that the latter were pernicious, and never read one of them. I now find myself confronted by two directly opposite statements respecting this mans sentiments, language and character. Which shall I believe, until I have time to examine for myself?
There remains to me only this means of discrimination between the two, the trustworthiness of the different reporters.
I have never known of Mr. Conway anything but was manly, honest and honorable. Every selfishly personal consideration would have urged him to avoid, by silence, the calumnious reproach which is sure to heaped upon him for such a statement, even if every particular of it is true. On the other hand, I can conceive of no reason for his saying such things unless he verily knows them to be true.
As to the Tract Society, and the religious newspapers (falsely so called)-whose representations I received with such implicit confidence while I was under their tuition-a long experience in subsequent years, with a careful sifting of many details of evidence, has given me conclusive proof that they are mendacious and malignant; and that their testimony respecting any person theologically varying from themselves is not for a moment to be credited, how ever made plausible by the (declared) quotation of his own words. They contrive to deceive by what they quote, as well as by their abstract, summery or paraphrase, of what they refrain from quoting. They are Jesuits under Protestantism.
Knowing that these men have lied, and still lie, about persons so pure, noble and excellent as William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Adin Ballou, Parker Pillsbury and Theodore Parker, why should I suppose them just and true in their statements respecting Thomas Paine? It is better to wait for further evidence; and Mr. Conway says this is truly and faithfully given in the record of Paines life by Mr. Vale; of which I knew not even the existence.-C.K.W.
Those who do not already posses Judge Strouds valuableSketch of the Laws relating to Slavery are referred to Messrs. John P. Jewett & Cos advertisement of it in this paper. This book tells us how vast an amount of the wickedness and cruelty of slavery is directly allowed by law. When we know, in addition to this, that the laws are so framed for the convenience of slaveholders that a little precaution on their part will enable them to perpetrate any additional wickedness or cruelty with impunity, we shall be prepared to form some faint idea of the atrocity of that system which the Democrats are trying to extend, and which the Republicans are not ashamed to perfect where already established, in spite of the outrages it has committed on their Sumner, their Hyatt, and their Sanborn, and its proscription of themselves generally throughout the slave region. Read Stroud, and then join the abolitionists in a war of extermination against slavery.-C.K.W
Echoes of Harpers Ferry. By James Redpath. Boston: Thayer and Eldridge, 114 and 116 Washington street. 12mo., pp. 513.
Of this valuable contribution to the history of our time there is room here to say only that it records some of the memorable words that have been spoken of captain John Brown, and that the proceeds of its sale are to aid the families of his deceased associates. Buy it for their sakes, and read it for your own.-C.K.W.
THE NEW TRACTS. Packages of these Tracts, especially ofThe New Reign of Terror in the Slaveholding States, were sent out last week to the following places, and we shall be glad to learn that they reached their destination safely:-To Lydia Mott, Albany; Samuel J. May, Syracuse; Susan B. Anthony, Rochester; Alonzo J. Grover, Earlville, Ill.; J. B. Chapbell, Clinton, Iowa; T. Chandler, Adrian, Michigan; William Crow, Grinnell, Iowa; Rev. N.T. Johnson, Topsham, Vt.; Rev. John E. Palmer, Lowe Waterford, Vt. Larger packages were previously sent to New York City, Philadelphia, and Salem, Ohio. Friends, wanting these publications, will please address SAMUEL MAY, Jr., 221 Washington street, Boston.
The Christian Examiner for May is at hand, and contains the following articles:-1, 
The Apocalypse Analyzed and Explained; 2, Worcesters Dictionary; 3.T. Starr Kings White Hills; 4, Arminius and Arminianism; 5, The Franklin Search and its Results; 6, Darwinss Origin of Species; 7, Review of Current Literature. Also, a list of New Publications and the Index to Vol. VI. The Examiner is one of the ablest of our religious Magazines, and the subjects treated in its pages are sure to find a vigorous pen, refined scholarship, and a liberal, Christian spirit.
DUBIOUS, IF NOT DOUBTFUL. The Atlas and Bee, in a notice of Mrs. Childs admirable tract,The Right Way the Safe Way, informs its readers that this work is written from the stand-point of the radical Abolitionists; and it adds, that the doctrine that immediate emancipation would not be dangerous to the general welfareis attempted to be proved by examples from the West Indies, and announces its conviction that Mrs. Childs logic is unanswerableif the premises be absolutely correct, and the conditions the same in the United States to-day as in the West Indies at the time of emancipation.
Not even a clergyman could have guarded himself more carefully against the suspicion of radicalism. One would think there was no great danger in the concession that justice and humanity would work well in practice, both for the giver and the receiver. But some people are cautious, alike by constitution and education; and we read of a man who pulled off his hat to the statue of Jupiter, and begged him to remember, if any change should restore him to power, that he was civil to him in his adversity.
The same paper, in a notice of the meeting of theChurch Anti-Slavery Society in New York, reports Dr. Cheever as having said thathe could see no reason why they should be attacked by the church and the press for doing battle against slavery. Dr. Cheever must have been incorrectly reported. Surely the cause of the churchs dislike of anti-slavery can be seen without spectacles. She would lose half her Doctors of Divinity, if slavery and caste should be adjudged anti-christian.-C.K.W.
A Democratic orator, addressing a meeting of his party in Philadelphia lately, exclaimed,-If any one dares to come into my neighborhood and preach such treason as that of G.W. Curtis and Wendell Phillips, by the everliving God he shall never leave the place alive! Such is the spirit, such the love of free speech, which animates the great mass of the slavery-extending party.
<c02>
MRS. DALLS BOOK.
The Boston correspondent of the Chicago Press and Tribune thus speaks respecting a work which, we are happy to learn, is receiving more and more of that public attention which it merits:-
While I am speaking of women of genius who have done faithful work in art, let me allude to a womans book which is attracting a good deal of attention in New England-a book which is a work of art at the same time that it is severe and faithful, dealing with hard facts, I mean Caroline H. Dalls Womans Right to Labor, or Low Wages and Hard Work. Mrs. Dall is not a fanatic for furious reform-an ignorant enthusiast-such as disgrace the cause which she advocates and disgust the community. She is a woman of the best social position and the highest culture, and she brings her unequalled powers, not to the composition of essays which would not to be tolerated from a man, but to the laborious collection of facts, to faithful induction of principles from facts, and to clear and brave admonitions, encouragement and instruction in the light of well grounded principles. In the quality of her work she stands pre-eminent. George W. Curtis and Wendell Phillips alone approach her out of the throng of reformers who profess to advocate womans rights. She has delivered a large number of lectures in and about Boston, many of which will undoubtedly be published. An English committee, including the most distinguished radical members of Parliament, has recently published one of these-a lecture on the Formation of Public Opinion in Regard to Woman, for gratuitious distribution throughout England. This is to be issued here at once. Mrs. Dall does only faithful work, and anything which she publishes is worth know how women reading. Any one who would know how women must, and can and may work, should get the book on Womans Right to Labor. It tells the whole, briefly and clearly, and with convincing force.

RETURN TRIP OF THE S.R. SPAULDING FROM CHARLESTON 
Discovery of a Fugitive Slave on board the Vessel-The Fugitive put on board the Ben Deford, bound for Baltimore.
[The steamship S.R. Spaulding arrived at this port at 2 1-2 o'clock this morning. The letter of our special correspondent is received but we are able to give only so much as relates to the return of a fugitive slave, and the abrupt commencement of the following may thereby be accounted for.]
AT SEA, Sunday 12 M., May 6. I expressed above somewhat of a lament at the probable, almost certain, want of incident on your return trip. All such lamentation must now, of course, disappear. This morning has witnessed a most exciting and unusual episode-the rendition of a fugitive slave. The particulars which I now give you are from an eye witness of the whole affair, and may re relied upon. It is a common fear with masters sailing to and from Southern ports, that slaves may secrete themselves between decks and lay now, until such time as it may be safe to show themselves Capt. Howes is not an exception to the rule, and your correspondent now readily calls to mind a conversation had in the wheelhouse on the outward passage, wherein the captain told him that he should deem it his bounden duty to return, under any and all circumstances, a fugitive discovered aboard a vessel under his command. 
He should consider it a duty he owed to his employers, whose interests were immediately at stake, and all considerations of private feelings or prejudice should have no practical weight while he thus represented the rights and trusts of others. It was conseqently the constant care of Capt. Howes at Charleston that no person owing service at the South should surreptitiously secure accommodations aboard the Spaulding, and a watch was kept at the gangway both night and day to prevent the occurrence of an event so greatly feared. Yet the precaution appears to have been fruitless, if that term can properly be used in such a connection. The development of to-day tell the whole story. At 3 o'clock this Sunday morning the firemen found in the coal bunks a negro of whose presence no one on board had before been aware; and knowing at once the character of the case so suddenly thrust before him, he gave an account of the discovery to the chief engineer, who in turn transmitted the intelligence to the captain.
Here was trouble, and at an hour, too, when the entire ship's company, with all that it embraced, was firmly locked in the arms of Morpheus. But little time for thought or hesitation was necessary, however. The judge of the time and place saw one course only marked out for him; that course was, to return the fugitive at all hazards. The question next presenting itself was, as to whether the steamer's head should be turned toward Norfolk. Va., or whether she should intercept the Benjamin Deford, which left Boston for Baltimore at P.M., Saturday. The Spaulding was now (4A.M.) twenty-five miles South west of Nantucket South Shoals, and her course was immediately changed form northeast half east to west, the captain making a pretty close, and remarkably correct(as it subsequently proved) calculation that he could, before many hours passed, cut off the Deford.
This disagreeable necessity of returning to the South would thereby be prevented. At breakfast hour, when the passengers came from the retirement of their various state-rooms and assembled about the table, the intelligence was circulated. Many were the sly and knowing winks, however. One was not to be fooled, and another knew all about it. The idea that it was a joke generally prevailed, and gathered strength in the minds of some from the recollection that on the day before certain facetious gentlemen had proposed the manufacture of a little amusement by darkening the complexion of one of the waiters and accidentally finding him between decks. The most earnest assurances could not convince such, and there was even a general disinclination to visit the wheel- house, where the material change in the steamer's course might be noted, or the fire-room where the colored individual was partaking of a hearty and much-needed meal. All doubts were soon removed, however, by unmistakable facts. The Deford, according to the prediction of the captain, was soon made, and we bore down upon her. The negro said he came last from Paducah, in Kentucky, and asserted that the had never been a slave although he had no free papers about him. He had helped to carry the instrument of the band to the concert given at Charleston. In his pocket was found a free
<c03>
pass to the concert. He gave his name as William Blocker, and said that he came on board the vessel on Tuesday afternoon, and had not eaten anything since. Ha came out into eight because he was thirsty and weak. 
It will be noticed that Blocker states that he was obliged to show himself on account of hanger. This was the reverse of truth. He was concealed in the forward coal bunk, and would have remained undiscovered until reaching Boston if the fireman had continued to take his supply from the after bunk, and had not gone to the other Sunday morning. But upon changing the place of supply, he saw the body of a person, whom he supposed to be dead. He had placed his hand upon the shirt-bosom, at first thinking it to be a piece of cloth, but found that it was part and parcel of a human form, and called to his assistant for aid. Upon that, Blocker came out into the light, and entreating strongly that he might not be exposed, offered the sum of twenty-five cents to each of the men if they would keep his secret. He told them he had not suffered from hunger, but that he had derived excellent nourishment from some crackers that he had brought with him.
Having changed course, and made the Deford, Capt. Hallett, as stated, at 8 o'clock we found ourselves within hailing distance of the sister steamer. The colors were hoisted at half-mast, with Union down, and guns were fired as signals that we were in trouble. An understanding having thus been secured, with vessels, after a short run, and when within about three hundred yards of each other, hove to, and preparations were at once made for transferring the fugitive. A boat, manned by two of the crew, and under command of the first officer, Mr. Atkins was lowered from the Spaulding, and Blocker having been brought on deck and given a seat therein, was rowed to the Deford. Before being pushed off. and while alongside, one of our passengers asked,-'How do you feel, Blocker?' Very well, sir,' was the smiling response.
When reaching the vessel that was to return him to his home, the fugitive turned toward us, and waving his hat, bade us good-bye. He appeared very cheerful, and made no complaints to those conveying him from us. The scene was one of considerable excitement, the decks of both steamers being alive with passengers. Upon the deck of the Deford were several ladies, who waved their handkerchiefs in response to our friendly greetings. Take good care of him,' sang out Capt. Howes from the upper deck. That we'll do,' was the ready and emphatic response. Mr. Atkins when returning, stated that the negro had been assured the best of treatment, and a just and fair presentation of his case before the properly constituted authorities at Baltimore. Capt. Hallett had at first thought the Spaulding was an English steamer bound for New York; but said that when we were recognized he readily guessed our trouble.- Boston Post, May 7.

From the Atlas and Bee, 9th inst. 
ESCAPE OF A FUGITIVE SLAVE ON THE STEAMER S. R. SPAULDING. 
There was no little commotion in our city yesterday, and the more especially among the colored population, at the announcement that a fugitive slave had arrived in the city. This was made still livelier when it became known that he came from the distinguished but now quiet city of Charleston, and in the noted steamer S. R. Spaulding. Such is the fact. He was the fellow passenger of the Massachusetts delegation to the great Democratic National Convention, though we cannot say he was in good standing among them. He was nevertheless a passenger, is a colored man, and was a slave up to the time of the steamer sailing from the sunny region of the Carolines. 
The name of the escaped slave is Norris. He is about 35 years old, is decidedly African, and belongs to the estate of Thomas Dixon, Ga., of Mason & Dixon's line fame. He was second engineer on a tow-boat running between Savannah and the river Tiber, S. C. He was regarded as a good hand, reliable, safe and all that, and had performed a great amount of hard labor for his masters. Norris looks as though he could do much service yet, even in a Northern atmosphere, where he proposes to spend a few years or more, having taken his liberty in his own hands. 
We shall not quite relate how he got on board the good steamer S. R. Spaulding with the Massachusetts delegation of Democrats, for we don't choose to go into certain details. It is fair to infer, however, that he exercised some little capacity and sagacity, which our Democratic friends are not apt to award to colored men. The low-boat, it seems, had extended somewhat its regular trip and visited Charleston, in the harbor of which city it remained for a while. Whether or not it brought or pulled any Southern delegates to Charleston, we are not informed; nor does it, we suppose, make any great difference. It was in the harbor, and Norris, no doubt, had the freedom of the city, after a fashion. 
It is pretty certain that he went on board several times; that as a boatman he was a sort of boon companion with the crew and hands for the time; that he concluded to take passage; and finally that he did take passage. We give the suppositions first, and the facts next. It seems that he got a good position on board, (in the fore part,) that he was not discovered, and that he arrived in Boston without putting the captain or anybody else either to the trouble or expense of stopping other vessels bound South or elsewhere. 
 Norris no doubt, felt much relieved when he turned his back upon the boat and proceeded up town to the West end. He reached the place arranged for him by friends who had been apprised of his arrival, and was made, we can easily believe, quite as comfortable as in his limited accommodations on board the steamer. 
The next and last act of this voyage from Charleston to the North, is a trip to Canada, the first part of which Norris will be making about the time many of our city and suburban readers are reading this paper at their breakfast-tables. We trust that he will have a pleasant and successful journey, and that he may find Canada, if not so sunny a land as the Carolinas, at least as pleasant, and that he will be among a people where color is no disgrace, and where no institution makes men machines and chattels. 
It seems that the S. R- Spaulding drove quite a business in kidnapping slaves. It would n't be surprising if it should turn out that they stole one for every delegate, which is rather more than we predicted they would do. We knew that such rank abolitionists as the majority of the Massachusetts delegation were would be up to stealing a few, and so said; but we did n't suppose they would go into the trade by wholesale. 

THE HORRORS OF THE COOLIE TRADE.
The London Times thus exposes the horrors of the Coolie Trade. If we are to credit the statement of the English news-mongers, American vessels are the chief instruments in this horrid commerce.
We have received by the last Overland China Chronicle some dreadful revelations as to the trade in Coolies. It appears that there is now organized in the southern ports of China a system of kidnapping to the full as bad as any ever practised by the native chiefs of Africa in the worst days of the slave trade. The information is brought before us in a strictly official form. The allied Commanders-in-Chief on the 12th of January of the present year, addressed a letter upon the subject to the Consular body at Canton. They enclosed the depositions of one hundred and five men, lately taken from certain Coolie receiving ships at Whampoa. Three of these ships were American; the fourth was an Oldenburg barque. The Coolies had been kidnapped, and a nominal consent to an eight years' engagement in Cuba was wrung from them by torture. The Commanders- in-Chief, tell the Consuls that they used every precaution to guard against deception in taking the depositions. Each witness was examined separately and apart from his companions.
The kidnapping process is carried on by the native Chinese, who pick up their unwary countrymen in the suburbs and outlying portions of the town, and then convey them on board Chinese boats, and so, in due course, on board the foreign ships. The Chinese agents decoy or force their victims on board their boats, and torture them until they wring from them a consent to become free emigrants.' The forms of torture employed are various. Their hands are tied together, and a wedge is hammered in between them. Their thumbs and great toes are tied together, their tails tied up, and they are thus hoisted off the deck and suspended in the air, while a lighted joss-stick is applied to their ancles. They are ducked in the river; they are togged in the most horrible manner; they are threatened with death; they are thrown into the river in baskets; and various other forms of torture are employed, until they consent to dip their finger in ink, and thus impress their mark upon the agreement.' The Mandarins, real or supposed, appear be the chief agents in these acts of cruelty. But it would be useless to examine into this part of the question at any length, for it is obviously a matter of indifference whether the foreign traders in human flesh executive these acts of cruelty by their own hands, or by the hands of their native agents. The idea that they can be ignorant of the coercion employed to force the wretched Coolies on board is too preposterous to admit of discussion.
A crazy slave in Columbia Co., Ga., a short time since murdered four fellow-slaves,(an old woman and three children.)The overseer was compelled to shoot the negro, and in that way to prevent the further destruction off property',
<c04>
ANOTHER TRIUMPH. A correspondent of the Anglo African, writing from New Bedford, says:-
The Supreme Court decision has been trampled under foot, as will be seen by the following from one of oar dailies:- 
DR. BAYNE ELECTED! We are informed that, instead of being beaten by seven rotes. Dr. Thomas Bayne is really elected a Councilman from Ward Four. The City Ordinances specify that at the election of any city officer, the name of the 'offiee for which he is a candidate must be stated on the ticket. But four of Mr. Robinson's tickets were thus incomplete, hence his election is void, and Dr. Bayne is the lucky man. We axe told that the Dr. intends to insist on his right, and claim the seat.'
Dr. Bayne is the well-known colored Dentist at No. 22 Cheapside street, at the sign of the Golden Tooth. He was supported by the Republican and Temperance parties. The Doctor has become quite prominent of late by having a large dental Alpine boulder extracted from his office, which was sent to the office of one of our weekly journals, (Administration, of course,) which resulted in a law suit, in which Robt. Morris, Esq., took a prominent part. I deeply sympathize with the loco-focos and Negrohaters who may be forced to sit with him in council'.
THE CHARLESTON CONVENTION.-On Thursday, the tenth day of its session, the Democratic National Convention adjoined to meet in Baltimore, June 18th, having failed to make a nomination. Fifty-five ballots were taken. Douglas started with 145 votes and closed with 151 1/2.On several ballots he received 152, which was just a majority, but as two-thirds of the whole number of the Convention (303) or 202 votes had been voted as the number necessary to nominate, no choice was effected. The confident declarations of Mr. Douglas's friends that he would have a majority on the first ballot, and two-thirds soon after, wholly failed of realization. Previous to voting, the Convention adopted the Cincinnati platform with the Dred Scott decision, and the denial of the right of Congress or Territorial Legislatures to prohibit slaveholders from carrying their chattels into the Territories. The leading candidate against Douglas was Guthrie of Kentucky. The delegates from the Cotton or Gulf States, who seceded, formed an organization but took no decisive action. The general impression of Douglas's friends is that he has been cheated and betrayed. 

MOBOCRACY IN BALTIMORE. A State Republican Convention assembled in Rechabite Hall, Baltimore, on the 29th ult., to appoint delegates to the National Republican Convention, to be held in Chicago on the 23d inst. Forty delegates were present, representing all the Congressional Districts, though not all the counties. Judge Blair, of Montgomery, presided. The Convention had been in session only an hour when it was broken up by a mob of desperate rowdies, set on. it is said, by prominent citizens of the city, who thought it little better than treason for such a body to assemble there. One of the Baltimore delegates, Mr. William Gunnison, had a narrow escape from bodily harm, if not from death. The mob ran after him in the street, hailing him as Old Osawatomie,' and crying, tar and feather him,' lynch him,' kill the scoundrel,' &c.; but the police finally rescued him. The Convention subsequently met in a more private place and completed its business. The press of Baltimore unites in condemning the outrage as disgraceful to the city, and calculated to advance the interests of the Republican party. 
HONOR TO WHOM HONOR,' &C. We were mistaken in saying, as we did a few weeks since, that Mr. Sedgwick was the only man who had ever made respectful mention of Garrison' on the floor of Congress. A friend has called our attention to a passage in the speech of Gerrit Smith on the Nebraska Bill, (see the volume of his speeches, p. 196.) in which he speaks of Garrison, Phillips, Goodell and Douglas,' in commendatory terms. We take pleasure in acknowledging our error, more especially as, in so doing, we have opportunity to honor the courage of Mr. Smith. It is true, however, that Mr. Sedgwick is the first man who, on the floor of Congress, has distinctly recognized Garrison's heroic relation to the Anti-Slavery Movement as its founder and pioneer.-A. S. Standard. 

FREE SPEECH TRIUMPHANT. We congratulate the friends of Free Speech every where upon the re-election of Mr. Henry as Mayor of Philadelphia. His course last winter, in defending the right of Abolitionists to utter their sentiments, chagrined and maddenned the deluded servitors of the Slave Power, who bent all their energies to the work of defeating him in the election held on Tuesday. The issue was directly between Freedom of Speech on the one hand, and the rule of the mob on the other; and gloriously has the right triumphed. Let us nope that the day of pro-slavery mobs is forever passed in Philadelphia.- A. S. Standard. 

AN OLD WOMAN. A writer in The Friends' Intelligencer furnishes an account of the death, on the first day of April, of Rachel Connor, a colored woman, of Bensalem township, Pa., at a very advanced age The correspondent says: She was formerly a slave in the State of Maryland. I examined her freedom papers, and, although somewhat mouse-eaten, I could decipher that she was manumitted on the 13th of January, 1804,' and, after giving her size, color and marks, it states, that she will be 56 years old in January next.' If, then, she was 56 years old in the 1st month. 1805, she must have been fully one hundred and eleven years and two months old at the time of her death, which occurred, as above stated, without much apparent suffering. She seemed desirous of endeavoring honestly to support herself, ever, since the commencement of her second century accustomed to farm work, she gave that the preference, and only a few years ago she was seen husking com' in quite cold weather. For the last three or four yean she was so nearly blind as to be unable to get about much; but she persevered in her habits of industry, and took in carpet rags to sew, at a small compensation, and she was dependent upon her neighbors, or passing children, to thread her needles. She seemed to have an abiding care to avoid talebearing, remarking, I never carries nothin' bout but my own color.' In many respects she was a good example to those who occupied a more conspicuous position in life. 
A SLAVE ESCAPING IN A CROCKERY CRATE. Among the freight of a certain steamer, which arrived at this port night before last, was a crate, which the captain innocently supposed to be filled with queen's-ware, but which in reality contained a live negro. The shipment was made at a town on the Cumberland river, and none of the officers ever suspected the contents to be other than were represented in the bill of lading till yesterday, when one of the firemen of the boat made a revelation of the fact to the astonished captain. It was then top late to remedy the matter, for the crate had been delivered to the consignee, and the adventurous negro, who had pursued freedom under difficulties, was safely under the roof of out who believed in that portion of the Mosaic dispensation which says,-'Thou shalt not return unto the master the servant which is escaped from his master/ &c.- Cincinnati Enquirer

GENEROUS GIFT TO REV. DR. WALKER. The sum of twenty thousand dollars has been presented within a few days past to Rev. Dr. Walker, the retiring President of Harvard University, by a few gentle-men of Boston, who desire by this addition to his resources to relieve his mind altogether from caret which might perhaps in some degree prevent him from spending the remainder of his life in such pursuits for the benefit of his fellow-men, rather than o advantage to himself, as are most congenial to his character. The gift certainly was well deserved, and the quiet and easy manner in which it was bestowed Bays the Advertiser, is creditable to the civilisation a the age. It was simply proposed to raise a subscription of $ 10,00$, but in a few hours the paper was, filled to the amount we have stated, and the thing was accomplished without exertion.-Bottom Traveller.

Tree Negroes in Charleston.-A recent letter from Charleston to the Spirit of the Times says: The most notable feature in the list of taxpayers of Charleston is the tax on property paid by free persons of color, The number of colored persons taxed is 355, and of these, 304 are owners of real estate, while 226 of then own real estate to the amount of $1000 or more-some of them nearly $50,000 worth the entire amount owned by the 226 above referred to amounts to $717,- 495! In addition to this I may as well inform you that the 355 personas of color who are free own 277 slaves.' 
Theodore Parker was to leave Rome for Switzerland on the 20th of April. He expects to be a at home in September. Mr. Parker does not speak very highly of living in Rome. The style of food is not such as to give vigor to an exhausted constitution, 
The New York Democrat states that the recent speech of Owen Lovejoy in the House of Representatives, has been translated into German. It calls it the most important speech that has been delivered Congress the present session. 
The intrinsic worth of woman is fully appreciated in Richmond, Va. From the report of a late auction sale, we learn that black women were valued and sold as follows:- Girls, 13 to 14 years old, Ml, U to $1,200; Women, $1,200 to $1,300.

PENNSYLVANIA YEARLY MEETING 
OF 
PROGRESSIVE FRIENDS. 
The eighth Yearly Meeting of Progressive Friends will convene at Longwood, Chester County, Pennsylvania, on First Day, the 3d of the Sixth month, [June,] 1860. 
This is a Religious Society, bound together by no ecclesiastical ligatures, but by a common tie of brotherhood and a common love of Truth, Purity, and Progress. It embraces men and women differing widely in theological opinion, but agreeing in the one great central doctrine and practice of true religion, which is love to God exhibited in love to man. It imposes on its members no farther test of membership than a desire to lead a life of greater personal purity, of more wide-spread practical beneficence, and of more ennobling and comforting religious aspirations. It seeks to inculcate a religion that shall prove its Divine character by bringing illumination to the mind, and inspiring it with a confident and cheering hope of a future life, and that shall, at the same time, prove its fitness for the regulation of human conduct by giving to men an enlarged idea of the dignity of human nature, of the sacredness of liberty, and of the right of every human being to a free and unhindered growth toward the pure pattern and ideal of Jesus of Nazareth. Its annual assemblies are for the purpose of mutual quickening and culture of a religious life, for the enjoyment and profit of social intercourse, and for the furtherance of all moral reforms whose object is the promotion of Truth, Purity, and Freedom. It accordingly gives a cordial and hearty invitation, in view of its coming re-union, to all persons, of whatever sect or creed, of whatever color or condition, who may feel attracted to such a meeting for such a purpose.

IT IS NOT A DYE. 
MRS.S.A.ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER.
The only preparation that has a EUROPEAN REPUTATION Warranted not to contain deleterious substances.
This pleasant and valuable preparation has been used for many years by hundreds of the most distinguished and wealthy persons, who have previously tried all the nostrums of the day without success, some even injuring their hair and health. This is entirely different from all others.

IS THERE ANY VIRTUE IN Mrs. S.A. Allen's Hair Restorative?'
We can answer this question by saying that we have already seen persons who have derived benefit from it.
'Persons personally known to us have come voluntarily, and told us to good results to either themselves or friends, who have used it before it became known in St.Louis.' St.Louis Presbyterian.
MRS. S.A. ALLEN'S HAIR RESTORATIVE has given universal satisfaction, wherever it has been used, It can be used with perfect safety, and its perfect freeness form all soiling, renders it a very desirable article for the toilet.'
Ch'n Witness and Ch. Advocate, Boston, Mass.
'MRS. S.A ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER is worthy of confidence.'
Philadelphia Christian Chronicle.
'Incomparably the best preparation we have ever used. 'N.Y. Evangelist.
All are compelled to acknowledge MRS.S.A.ALLEN'S as the Hair Restorer.' N.Y. Independent.
'MRS.S.A.ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER has taken its place at the head of all articles of the kind.' Michigan Christian Herald.
Dispel all doubts as to its efficacy.'
Knoxville Presbyterian Witness.
'There never has been a prescription or remedy for improving the hair, published in the Advocate, which was so fully endorsed by men of unquestioned standing, as in that of Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S
Buffalo Christian Advocate
Another objection to dyes is the unlife-like coler and appearance they cause the hair to assume, and the only way to have grey hair assume its 
NATURAL YOUTHFUL COLOR, is to use that which will be effectual and yet not a dye-Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER will do this.' U. S. Journal.
In these times, when every cosmetic is warranted as the greatest discovery of the present day, it is refreshing to come across that which is what it PRETENDS to be. A really excellent article is Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER. A as assistant to nature, it is of great service; and a man by using it often prevents a serous and unnecessary loss of hair.

Saturday Evening Gazette, Boston,
Those of our readers whose hair is turning grey or losing its color, and who are opposed to using a dye, will find in Mrs. S.A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER a preparation that will speedily change the hair to its natural color, and at the same time render it soft. It is superior to any heretofore produced for restoring and beautifying the hair, POSSESSING NONE OF THE BURNING QUALITIES OF A DYE.'
Philadelphia Mercury.
There is no Hair preparation, we believe, that has acquired more popularity than Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER. Why is this? Simply because it is a preparation of real merit, and has never failed, in a single instance, to produce the good effects ascribed to it on the part of its propertietor. Its sales are constant and most extensive, and we begin to think that it is denominated most appropriately the World's Hair Restorer,' Newark Register.
We have reason to be assured that Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER' is among the best articles of its kind ever discovered; indeed the wide circulation and immense sales it has achieved, fully demonstrate that its efficacy is generally appreciated.' Rahway Register.
Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLDS'S HAIR RESTORER. The most successful remedy of the day. We know of instances where its good effects  have been remarkable.' Weekly Visitor, Franklin N.Y.
'From individual cases that have come under our own observation, we are satisfied that Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER" performs all that it promises, and that instead (as is the case with other restoratives extensively used and highly recommended) of being a useless waste of time and money, it is just what it is represented to be, and will perform all its proprietor engages it to perform. We therefore most cordially commend it to the notice and use of those of our readers who need a remedical agent of this character.' St. Louis Ledger.
"Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER. -As we were travelling in Massachusetts a short time since, we met a lady whose appearance indicated that she had attained the age of sixty. So we inferred, and but for her beautiful hair, we should have added several years. After some conversation she spoke of her hair, informing us that two years ago, at least one half of it was grey, and that the had feared that before then the whole would have turned or fallen off. But our friend read the papers, and acquainted herself with the various remedies for decaying hair and at length determined to obtain Mrs. Allen's Restorer. She did so, and applied it according to directions, and before a year had passed, she assured us that she had as luxurious, even and beautiful head of hair, as when she was but sixteen years old. Her statement was confirmed by other members of the family, while we were informed that in the same neighborhood there were other instances where the same happy and signal effect had been produced by applying Mrs. S. A. Allen's World's Hair Restorer.'
Providence Daily Tribune.
'Among the very few preparations that we deem deserving of mention, we are by no means inclined to omit Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER.' It has been thoroughly tested, and found to be all its inventor claims for it; and to deny its excellence would be to deny assertions made in its favor by scores and hundreds of the most respectable persons.' Rahway Advocate and Register. 
Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER is the best preparation extant for the various incident to the hair and scalp, and is warranted to restore the hair and whiskers, however grey, to their natural color. It having been before the public for many years, and its efficacy in restoring, invigorating, and beautifying the hair fully established, by hosts of persons throughout the country, has led to the manufacture of many worthless imitations, which have been successfully palmed off in numerous instances, upon the public as genuine.' 
Brooklyn Morning Journal. 
' This preparation is superior to any heretofore produced for restoring and beautifying the hair. It possesses none of the burning, cauterizing powers of the old dyes, but gives the hair a healthy. glossy appearance almost instantaneously. The Restorer is easily applied, and will not stain the finest linen. The effect is sure in every instance, if applied according to the directions.' Mercury. Philadelphia.

POETRY.
For the Liberator.
WE ARE SLAVES.
BY REV. J. T. POWERS.
We are slaves! poor slaves!
No spangled banner waves
Above our heads; we are not free;
For us are chains-not liberty!
We are slaves! our toil-worn hands
Are forced to labor for the lands
Of our oppressors; whilst lash and rod,
Wielded by tyrants in the place of God,
Bid streams of gore to flow from out our veins;
Such is the heritage of those in chains!
We are slaves! bought and sold
For shining ore called gold!
Sold in the shambles, like beasts of the field,
Unto the highest bidder; what we yield
Is his, all his-our master;-
There is no course, nay, no disaster
Like unto ours-us men call slaves;
For us no spangled banner waves!
We are slaves! O God! how long
Shall we be LAWFUL prey unto the strong?
Dost Thou not hear our cries, nor count our tears?
Dost Thou not watch us struggling with our fears?
Make haste, great God! to succor and to save,
And rid our land from every wretched slave!
Carlisle, Mass.

A DROP OF GIN.
Gin! Gin! a drop of Gin!
What Magnified monsters circle therein!
Ragged, and stained with filth and mud,
Some plague-spotted, and some with blood!
Shapes of misery, shame, and sin!
Figures that make us loathe and tremble;
Creatures scarce human, that more resemble
Broods of diabolical kin,
Ghoul and vampyre, demon and Gin!
Gin! Gin! a drop of Gin!
The dram of Satan! the liquor of Sin!
Distilled from the fell
Alembics of hell,
By Guilt and Death, his brother and twin!
That man might fall
Still lower than all
The meanest creatures with scale and fin.
But, hold-we are neither Barebones nor Prynne,
Who lashed with such rage
The sins of the age;
Then, instead of making too much of a din,
Let Anger be mute,
And sweet Mercy dilute,
With a drop of Pity, the drop of Gin!
Gin! Gin! a drop of Gin!
When, darkly, Adversity's days set in,
And the friends and peers
Of earlier years
Prove warm without, but cold within,
And cannot retrace
A familiar face
That's steeped in poverty up to the chin:
But snub, neglect, cold shoulder, and cut
The ragged pauper, misfortune's butt;
Hardly acknowledged by kith and kin,
Because, poor rat!
He has no cravat,
A seedy coat, and a hole in that!-
No sole to his shoes, and no brim to his hat!
Nor a change of linen-except his skin;
No gloves, no vest,
Either second or best;
And, what is worse than all the rest,
No light heart, though his trousers are thin-
While time elopes
With all golden hopes,
And even with those of pewter and tin;
The brightest dreams,
And the best of schemes,
All knocked down, like a wicket by Mynn.
Each castle in air
Seized by giant Despair,
No prospect in life worth a minnikin pin;
No credit, no cash,
No cold mutton to hash,
No bread-not even potatoes to mash;
No coal in the cellar, no wine in the bin-
Smashed, broken to bits,
With judgments and writs;
Bonds, bills, and cognovits distracting the wits,
In the webs that the spiders of Chancery spin-
Till, weary of life, its worry and strife,
Black visions are rife of a razor or knife;
Of poison-a rope-'louping over a linn.'
Gin! Gin! a drop of Gin!
Oh! then its tremendous temptations begin,
To take, alas!
To the fatal glass;-
And happy the wretch that does not win
To change the black hue
Of his ruin to 'blue'-
While angels sorrow, and demons grin-
And lose the rheumatic
Chill of his attic.
By plunging into the palace of Gin! HOOD.

BETHLEHEM AND GOLGOTHA.
O, march we not in martial band,
But with the Spirit's flag unfurled!
Let US subdue the Holy Land,
As Christ himself subdued the world.
Let beams of light on every side
Fly, like Apostles, far and wide,
Till all men catch the beams that play
O'er Bethlehem and Golgotha.
With pilgrim staff and scallop-shell
Through Eastern crimes I sought to roam;
This counsel have I found to tell,
Brought from my travels to my home;-
With staff and scallop do not crave
To see Christ's cradle and his grave;
Turn inward! there in clearest day
View Bethlehem and Golgotha.
O heart! what helps it, that the knee
Upon His natal spot is bended?
What helps it, reverently to see
The grave from which he soon ascended?
Let him within thee find his birth;
And do thou die to things of earth,
And live Him,-let this be for aye
Thy Bethlehem and Golgotha.
-Rueckert, translated by Dr. Frothingham.

O'CONNELL'S ORATORY.
[From Sir Edward Littleton's new poem.
'Once to my sight the giant thus was given.
Walled by wide air, and roofed by boundless heaven;
Beneath his feet the human ocean lay,
And wave on wave flowed into space away.
Methought no clarion could have sent its sound
Even to the centre of the hosts around;
And as I thought rose the sonorous swell,
As from some church tower swings the silver bell,
Aleft and clear, from airy tide to tide
It glided, easy as a bird may glide;
Te the last verge of that vast audience sent,
It played with each wild passion as it went:
Now stirred the uproar, now the murmur stilled,
And sobs or laughter answered as it willed.
Then did I know what spell of infinite choice,
To rouse or lull, has the human voice:
Then did I seem to seize the sudden clue
To the grand troublous Life Antique-to view
Under the reek stand of Demosthenes,
Mutable Athens heave her noisy seas.'

THE LIBERATOR.
PUBLIC OPINION.
A Lecture delivered in the City of New York,
BY KARL HEINSEN.
Translated for the Liberator from the German by MARY L.BOOTH.
The world is not usually so scrupulous in respect to the currency of the intellectual as of the commercial market. A coin without a fixed stamp, or an obliterated bank note, is refused by every one; but in the intellectual market, those coins often have the greatest circulation and the highest value, whose stamp or worth no one can perceive or define. We have a considerable number of such coins among us; for example, I need only to remind you of the words,' Spirit of the Times,' the People,' 'Virtue,' etc. But none circulates more readily, and is at the same time more indistinct and undefinable in its value, than that which is called Public Opinion. Every man, though he may never have had an opinion of his own, knows how to speak of Public Opinion;-every man, though he may refuse to tolerate any other opinion than his own, has yet respect for that which is called public opinion; and this public opinion is so confident of nothing as that it is the greatest of all existing powers. And yet, who knows this mysterious power? who can define, who analyze it? Is it a spirit, a phantom, a demon, a law, a caprice, a realty, a fancy?
It is certainly worth while to make it an object of special investigation, for since every one has a share in it, every one, through its criticism, criticises himself. In fact, such an investigation would be a criticism upon society at large, as well as its history; but we who are confined to the limits of a short essay can only glance briefly at the principal points.
It is characteristic that the greatest power which men acknowledge is' Opinion.' We do not speak of public comprehension or conviction-this would be too presuming; we content ourselves with public opinion. An opinion is not even a view, it is only a timid insinuation of a belief, a bashful or shrinking obliquity, as it were, of the mind, which cannot establish a certain judgment, but can only encourage and justify an attempt at a judgment. The people of Opinion are those who have invented the might be and could be, and who are always ready the next minute to mean something different from what they had meant the minute before. And shall these people form the power to rule the mind? On the Rhine there is s proverb that says, 'Who means, lies.'
But, independently of the question, what value opinion has to truth, it must next be asked how many men themselves possess the feeble mental endowment which we call a personal opinion. If there is a public opinion, then this can only be considered as the sum of the personal opinions of the individuals who constitute society. But among these millions of individuals, there are proportionally but very few who have a personal opinion, or who dare to follow it, and therefore the opinion of the majority is only the echo of that which has proceeded from those few. Thus, on the whole, we cannot speak of public opinion. In this view, the expression 'public echo' would be much more suitable. If ten millions blindly accept and repeat the expression of a single individual, is their opinion any thing else than that of this single individual? Real thinking is a task which single individuals must always perform for the millions; among these, there are again a number who think over what has before been thought, and really appropriate it to themselves; but the majority only catch at its passing sound, if it happens to flatter or impose upon their ear; and in mechanically repeating what they have heard, they express what is called 'public opinion.' Was a single one of the Germans, who help to form the Democratic party, of the opinion upon his disembarkation on these shores that the sale of men could be a republican institution? But after they have learned here that the trade in negro flesh is truly democratic, they all became of the public opinion, that a German betrays the republic if he does not join in the cry that negroes are not men! But if we take into further consideration, that even what is repeated by the opinionless is in truth only brought to public expression by the very few-that only upon extraordinary occasions, such, for example, as revolutionary outbreaks, the people, the mass, are in the habit of expressing what they feel and mean upon certain questions, it becomes the more doubtful whether by public opinion a general opinion of the word-leaders of the first or second rank is not to be understood. In this case, even 'public echo' would appear a daring expression. Only from the fact, that very few men have an individual opinion, can we explain why things of the most universal interest so often and so long leave the great mass indifferent. He who really has an individual opinion cannot look on quietly, and see it actively opposed. In respect to lager beer, for instance, all Bavarians have an individual, yes, even a decided public opinion; therefore they rebel when the price of beer exceeds this opinion. Had a republic been so clearly within the range of their comprehension, they would long since have rid themselves of the monarchy. The so-called material interests of the masses would move them just as little as the mere mental or moral interest, if they approximated as little to their opinion, if they did not go hand in hand with the common necessities of their opinion, and if this opinion did not bring every thing in contact; whilst, on the other side, nobler or better educated men are determined chiefly by mental or moral interests, because their opinion' was preoccupied with them. There are, notwithstanding, interests upon which all men have an individual and unanimous opinion; but these interests are almost exclusively those of animal nature, and those lower spheres of life which are closely connected with it. Nature has her fixed laws and necessities, which indirectly produce fixed and unanimous opinions. But with culture, whose eternal vocation it will be to discover nature in the unnatural, necessity in freedom, laws in general development, begins deviation, dependence, confusion of opinions; and the question whether public opinion, as a fixed law, has a definite universal meaning, can point out a safe mode of action, is always at least capable of being answered by public opinion itself.
How little public opinion it taken by competent judges for what it should be is unconsciously demonstrated by the fact of appeal to it where no publicity exists. To public opinion, two things certainly belong: first, opinion; and secondly, publicity.-Where in Europe, most of all in France-where does the one exist, and where the other? Do we not daily bear the tyrant in Paris himself appealing to public opinion? Where has it its organ in France? Perhaps on the Bourse. Where has this hypocrite heard it, who permits no other opinion to be spoken than that of his creatures, and suffers no other publicity than that of servility? He, like all oppressors and deceivers of the people, ascribes to the mass an opinion, in order to cause his oppression and deception to be apparently sanctioned by those who have the most to suffer from it; and in the course of time, it often really comes to pass that the opinionless masses believe in the opinion thus forced upon them. Were not this the case, a universal burst of derisive laughter would be heard in the countries of secret government, and universal muteness as often as these governments appealed to public opinion.
But the most effectual means by which to inspire the masses with a holy respect for the opinion thus dictated to them consists in the original invention of putting into their mouth the 'voice of God,' Vox populi, vox Dei, we bear in countries where a free exchange of opinions exists. From thoughtlessness as well as from deception, each day is repeated the sanctification of every humbug, and the glorification of every phenomenon which proves its success by the so-
<C03>
called public. It should, on the contrary, be said, vox Dei, vox populi, for the voice of the people is that of their deceivers, who persuade them of every absurdity and cruelty, and then, in order that they may not be terrified at the sound of their own voice, make of this voice the echo of supernatural authority. If we consider all the terrible things that the 'voice of God' has heretofore said, commanded and called good, neither can it then be thought possible if we leave it no other support and authority than that of the voice of the people. Even the most opinionless people will not endure the misusage, in their own name, which they are willing to endure in the name of God. At no time have the people more cause to look out for themselves than when their good friends assure them that their voice is God's voice, as we look to our pockets in the presence of certain people when we hear them extol our honesty and morality. When the devil has to make use of public opinion, he dates it from God, and calls it the voice of the people.
If we would sum up in one word everything that is unreliable, capricious, desirous of change, and foolish, we may use the expression, Public Opinion. What is Fashion? She is the child of Public Opinion, and charactises her mother better than any other manifestation. Is there anything more tyrannical, and at the same time more servile?-anything more enigmatical, and at the same time more stupid?-anything more obstinate, and at the same time more changeful than Fashion? Who dictates and changes this law, which, without giving or listening to reasons, prescribes to us our external appearance, domestic arrangements, etc.? Does it proceed from the acknowledgment, the consent, or the will of those who obey it? Any person or any place of influence gives to longing humanity a fashion, and in a few weeks a whole world of dress and other necessities is condemned, and another arises in its place. 'It is not fashionable' means the same as 'It is wrong, it is illegal, it is forbidden.' It never occurs to any person to dress according to his own idea, taste, or needs. He must dress as the public opinion of coats, boots, hats and hoops prescribes. And this public opinion is just as despotic as it is capricious. To-day, long coats are fashionable, to-morrow, short ones; to-day, loose trowsers, to-morrow, tight ones; to-day, boots with heels, to-morrow, boots without them; to-day, peaked hats, to-morrow, round ones; to-day, modern furniture, to-morrow, archaic And wherefore all this? Because a courtier and a tailor, a queen and a manufacturer of Paris or some other place, have set the example or given the signal. When it comes to pass that every man can arrange his dress and surroundings in accordance with his individual tastes and needs, it will be a token that the world of mind and matter has undergone a complete revolution. But, at present, men are. generally speaking, as well in their views as in their dress, the slaves of fashion.
The surest of all tests by which to try the efficiency and value of so-called Public Opinion is the indisputable fact, not only that truth always proceeds from individuals, and in the beginning is represented by the minority, but also that its representatives have been hated and persecuted by the mass, or by Public Opinion. What can be more suitable, more justifiable, more legitimate, or more desirable subjects of Public Opinion than universal principles and truths which no human reason dares to deny, and which true universal interests put into words? And yet is it not always against such principles and truths that Public Opinion, that is, the majority of opinions, rebels? And is not the mental and moral 'twice one are two' a stumbling-block and offence to the masses? Are they not precisely the representatives of such principles without which mankind must go to destruction, and no moral world could exist? Are not these precisely the men who are excommunicated, and held o dious by mankind in general, whilst the representatives of falsehood are glorified and chosen as its leaders? Is there an expression which is more generally acknowledged by Public Opinion than the old Latin proverb, 'Mundus vult decipi'-the world wishes to be deceived? Does not Public Opinion, through this acknowledgment, condemn itself to nothingness, as the servant of falsehood? Does not the universal recognition of this proverb say, in other words, The voice of the people is the voice of God, and the voice of God is the voice of falsehood? Wherefore, then, appeal to Public Opinion, if experience proves that the right to such an appeal generally conveys a suspicion instead of a recommendation? He who discovers and speaks the truth, or aspires to true greatness of humanity, may, as a general rule, certify to himself the truth of his position by saying: 'I am right, for public opinion is against me.' The mere fact that an idea or a person is popular, that is, acceptable to the so-called public opinion, must almost render a thinking spectator distrustful; for that which can bear criticism is seldom popular. The mass knows no criticism. Kotzebue was more popular than Goethe, and Douglas is more popular than Sumner. There was a time when Public Opinion permitted the sun to revolve around the earth. The earth revolved upon its own axis contrary to this Public Opinion, and has continued to do so unto this very day; yet, at that time, Public Opinion, together with the priests, enjoyed the satisfaction of persecuting an old man who could not believe in the revolution of the sun, because he saw the contrary with his clearer eye. And, what is more significant, is that, although everyone knows now that it is not the sun, but the earth that moves, the 'voice of the people' still suffers the sun daily to rise and to set, as though by way of consolation to this poor Public Opinion, which seeks to honor the memory of a long-buried error by the continuance at least of its expression. Since Public Opinion always contains a mixture of old truth and new error, or of new truth and old error, it will seldom bear the whole truth, and wishes at least that it should be clad in the garb of falsehood.
What would enlightenment, development, in short, progress, have to hope, for if it were to respect public opinion, and be guided by the wise proverb, Vox populi, vox Dei? Has this voice ever explained to the subjects of a king the advantages of a republic? Has it ever acknowledged the equal rights of men and women? Has it ever prevented the introduction of slavery? Has it, as a general rule, ever sought to prevent absurdity and wrong, or left the truth and right which opposed these free from insult? The world would have therefore eternally stood still, absurdity and wrong would have held eternal possession of its once usurped government, if public opinion had been the competent judge of progress, and if the proverb, Vox populi, vox Dei, had had a decisive value. Public opinion was always the tyrant of truth, and right when victorious; and only when conquered by them, it became their servant.
Public opinion has, in all ages wherein it most needed the flame of truth, sought to stifle this beneath another flame which merely burned without giving light, namely, the flame of the stake, as well for men as for books. Wagner says in Faust:
'But the world! the human heart and mind.
Would that all men knew how to comprehend them!'
To which Faust answers-
'Yes, what is called to comprehend!
But who dares call the child by its right name?
The few that comprehended something of it,
And, foolish, guarded not their swelling heart,
But to the mob revealed their feelings, visions,
Have ever been proscribed and crucified.'
The public opinion of hating contemporaries condemns the living to the stake, and the public opinion of their compassionate successors from the ashes of this stake afterwards erects a pillar in honor of the dead. It must be very elevating to be roasted by the present generation, in order to be glorified by the coming! Why does not this logic of future unanimity rule all conditions? How consoling would it be if this extended even to love, so that the bride and bridegroom should live during life in constant hos-
<c04>
tility, and the nuptial kiss should burn upon dying lips alone! But this has ever been the course of progress and the success of truth. Every representative of truth and promoter of enlightenment would therefore be sure of the consent, approval, even love of the world, if he but understood the art of prolonging his life indefinitely: wherefore it would be advisable before all things else for him to study the macrobiotic science. How happy was Kepler in being an astronomer! For as such, he will now at least be able to look down from the stars upon the monument erected by those who left him here without bread.
From this we may deduce the law that public opinion is wrong in respect to the truths of the present, and only occasionally does justice to the truths of the past. For this assertion, there are conclusive proofs in plenty. I will only remind you of the wellknown fact, that the public opinion of the whole world acknowledges Brutus as a great man, and William Tell as a liberator; yet the successors of these in modern times are only protected from public insult, even in America, by a comparatively small number of partisans.
But we have chiefly to ask of what this public opinion consists, what its value may be, and how this mysterious thing may be analysed? In the analysis of this, two elements are first of all to be considered, namely, the contested questions of the present, and the settled questions of the past. While public opinion absorbs the latter, it receives a solid basis and a lasting value. In respect to that which experience and knowledge really secure to it, it has a right to appear as authority. It is in this respect the whole foundation of further developments, the universal intellectual depot or storehouse from which progress continually takes its material and its weapons. That the sun stands still and the earth moves, no one will henceforth call in question, since it is now universally acknowledged by public opinion. In the like manner, there are a thousand other results of investigation which are ceded without dispute by the critical judgment to public opinion, not because they are approved by this public opinion, but because they have stood, and still stand, the test of examination. The credit of public opinion is becoming more doubtful in relation to such truths of the past as have not been discovered through positive science, but through socalled wisdom and moral reflection. These relate mostly to man himself, who, though he has progressed so far in the investigation of nature, still remains the greatest mystery of all, since progressing culture continually brings him into new relations, and calls forth his activity to solve new problems. How suspiciously, too, the wisdom of public opinion, in respect to the treasures bequeathed to it by past ages, is to be regarded, is best proved by the proverbs, by those dogmatical sentences of popular life-experience accredited through the voice of the people, the 'voice of God,' and the testimonies of centuries. Many a one has done good service to the public by collecting these proverbs, but he would have done a greater one by criticising them, and this would be a fit theme for a special lecture; for the greater part of these proverbs, bequeathed by public opinion from one generation to another, and quoted as infallible truths, consist of superficial assertions and untenable falsehoods which continually do great harm as vehicles of ignorance and pillows of stupidity.
The mystical idea which is generally connected with the words 'public opinion,' is in no point more exaggerated than in relation to the 'power' which is said to be exercised by public opinion. Without doubt, this power exists wherever the narrowness and fanaticism of the mass pursue and proscribe a single individual; for public opinion is despotism towards the weak, and servility towards the strong. We perceive its power, too, upon every occasion in which a general outbreak of passion or wild frenzy of rashness accomplishes a so-called act of the people-a Presidential election, for example, for which no one has to atone more deeply than the people themselves. But public opinion is always more powerful in playing stupid tricks than in repairing them in season, and has often pushed the car so deeply in the mud in a single day, that ten years have not sufficed to drag it out again. But what influence has public opinion in its very progress, in vanquishing its obstacles, in destroying its enemies? For this influence only can be meant when we speak of the power of public opinion. From the ideas that prevail in respect to this power, one would think that an enemy of freedom, of public morality, and of the public welfare, would only need to show himself to be struck down at once by the voice of public opinion; and yet we see every where the enemies of the public welfare, who have been called to power by public opinion, but whom public opinion is unable to remove from it again. Had not all the tyrants of Europe, from the one in Rome to the one in Paris, the majority of opinions with them in the beginning? But now, when these would undoubtedly be turned against them, could they be openly expressed, does public opinion threaten to overthrow them? Is it possible to put public opinion to a more shameful test, or to glut it more fully, than has been done by the vile acts of the French monster and his colleagues? And how and with what does public opinion meet all these? So long as their soldiers remain trusty, their police vigilant, and their subjects pay their taxes, there is nothing from which they have so little to fear as from public opinion. That they are indifferent to it comes from the fact that they do not hear it. Confused by the anguish of their evil consciences, they also labor under the mystical idea that public opinion is what it always should be, namely, a unanimously destructive condemner of the bad, and a unanimously ruling upholder of the good. They also confound the future, wherein public opinion will condemn them, with the present, wherein it bows to them. We have before remarked that the public opinion of the future is always in the right, in contrast with the wrong of the present; but will it afflict the tyrants of the present, that the public opinion of the future will triumph over their graves? And what avails this future triumph of an unborn generation to the people of the present time who must suffer under tyranny? Herein lies the greatest evil, that public opinion is not prompt in its justice, that its justice comes too late, that its voice falters when it should prove its power, and that it only first discovers its strength when mated at last with despair. Only in revolution, wherein the dim impulse of oppressed mankind finds relief in a passionate outbreak, and public opinion becomes not merely a voice but a hand, does it become a real power. But for how long? We have lived to see. To-day it rises to overthrow tyranny, and to-morrow it turns and helps again to establish the tyrants. Because the passionately impulsive opinion of the masses has no lasting judgment on its side, no thoroughly cultured intellect for its foundation, and no consistent will for its executive power, they build up to-day what they destroyed yesterday, and will destroy to-morrow what they have built up to-day. Were public opinion in truth what it is generally declared to be, revolutions would not be necessary, still less could their effect ever come to nought.
But, it will be objected, this whole theory will do indeed for Europe, where Public Opinion can pass through no school, but it will not do for America, where Public Opinion sits in judgment daily, and has its trusty organs. Well, let us speak then of America. (Conclusion next week.)
Several slaves belonging to Mr. Craig, residing bark of Covington, Kentucky, recently made their escape. They walked all the way to Cleveland, following the railway track. One of them thought it was a hard road to travel, and when about half way to Cleveland, proposed to go back; but his companions were in good courage, and persuaded him to keep on with them, which he did. They took the steamer at Cleveland for Detroit, and from that city crossed into the Queen's dominions.

From the New York Independent.
STEPHENS AND HAZLETT.
Of Hazlett, but little has been made known to the public-not even his true name, which is not Hazlett, but Harrison. He was one of the youngest of Captain Brown's companions, and remarked, while in prison, that on the day of his execution, March 16th, his age would be exactly 22 years, 22 weeks, and 22 days, he had a serious and thoughtful mind, yet was fond of adventure, and, ten exhibited much personal courage. Of his views and purposes against slavery, be wrote in a letter, the day before his death, these honorable words:-'I am willing to die in the cause of Liberty. If I had ten thousand lives, I would willingly lay them all down for the same cause. My death, will do more good than if I had lived.'
Aaron Dwight Stephens was a more remarkable man. He was regarded by Captain Brown as his most reliable lieutenant. He seems to have inherited his revolutionary principles from his great-grand-father, who once presided at a public meeting in Pomfret, Connecticut, in furtherance of the American war of Independence, and who sent a personal gift of 20 sterling to General Washington at Valley Forge. What could have been expected of a young man in whose family had been transmitted, through four successive generations, so signal an example of sedition?
Stephens was born and bred a Yankee boy, in Norwich, Connecticut; lost his mother, and left home, at an early age; earned by his industry an honest living and a good name; took up arms in Kansas in defence of her freedom, and took up arms against Virginia to liberate her slaves. On the day before his execution, he reached his twenty-ninth year. His personal appearance was in no small degree prepossessing. A recent photograph, taken in his cell, represents a face remarkable for an intelligent, amiable, and benevolent expression. He had large blue eyes, and auburn hair and beard. He was noted among his friends for the animation, and oftentimes brilliancy of his conversational powers. He was a favorite in social companies as a singer. His father, Mr. Aaron Stephens, of Norwich, (choir leader in the Rev. Mr. Arms's Congregational church,) says of him: 'My son had one of the finest bass voices I ever beard.' He was of a kind and sympathetic nature, which led him always to take lie side of the innocent and wronged. Any specially kind act from friend or stranger would move him to tears. Writing from prison to a person who had befriended him daring his sufferings, he said: 'I believe I shall be killed with kindness sooner than in any other way.'
His sister, Mrs. Pierce, of Norwich, (a lady who, though considerably younger, bears a striking resemblance, both in face and figure, to the wife of Capt. Brown,) visited the prisoner at Charlestown, and held repeated interviews with him daring the last eight days preceding the execution. The jailer, Capt. Avis, allowed her every facility of access, without being compelled by military orders (as in he case of Mrs. Brown) to search her person for hidden weapons or poisons. Indeed, there seems to have been no foundation even for a suspicion that either of the prisoners desired to make so poor a choice of deaths as to take suicide in preference to the scaffold.
On her arrival at Charlestown, before her first entrance into the cell, Capt. Avis considerately removed the chains from the prisoner's feet, that she might not be unnecessarily reminded of the discomfort of his confinement. Stephens, in speaking afterwards to his sister of this act, said of Capt. Avis: 'He is the finest man in Virginia, there is not another like him.' A photograph which we have seen of Capt. Avis shows a face of unmistakable decision, courage, and kindness.
'I asked my brother,' said Mrs. Pierce, 'what was his intention in going to Harper's Ferry.'
'It was for good,' he replied, 'it was to help my fellow-men out of bondage. You know nothing of slavery; I know a great deal. It is the crime of crimes. I hate it more and more the longer I live. Even since I have been lying in this cell, I have beard the cryings of slave children torn from their parents.'
He then narrated, in detail, that, during his imprisonment, a woman had been sold in the jail, and separated from her husband and three children. He stated, also, that in the family of the jailer was a slave girl, who had ran away from a severe mistress on account of unkind treatment, and who fled for refuge to Mrs. Avis, by whom her time was bought, and by whom she will eventually be set free.
During one of Mrs. Pierce's visits, a Virginian called to see the prisoners, in order to tell them that the slaves at the South were in a better condition than the poor people of the North.
'I am poor myself,' replied Stephens, 'but I never yet saw the day, in all my life, when I would have exchanged liberty for riches.'
On another occasion, his sister asked if he had been roused to a bitter or revengeful spirit under his imprisonment; to which he replied-
'No; for I believe I can truly say that I love every man, woman, and child on earth; I can forgive the men who hang me. When we went to Harper's Ferry, we had no intention to injure a single human being; our design was to free the slaves without bloodshed, just as we had done in Missouri; we carried rifles and pikes only for self-defence, and to inspire, by the appearance of military force, a fear of resisting us in our project. I think no man was killed by any of our party until after I was shot down while bearing a flag of trace. Some of the Virginians were killed by their own party by mistake. As for myself, I did not shed a single drop of blood, except from my own wounds.'
Stephens was pierced in different parts of his body by six bullets, two of which he carried, lodged in his neck, to the grave.
'I am glad,' he said, after a reference by his sister to the great pain which he had suffered, 'I am glad that I did not die of my wounds; for I believe that my execution upon the gallows will be a better testimony for truth and liberty.'
His sister sang with him several hymns, among which his favorites were the following:
'Joyfully, joyfully, onward we move'-
'To-day the Savior calls '-
'We're travelling home to heaven above.'
He was so greatly comforted and cheered by his sister's companionship, that on one occasion, he said to her-'I may ask you to go on the scaffold with me; and if I do, I want you to go.' This he said playfully.
His moral courage under his trial, and in view of death, is clearly manifest in his numerous letters written in prison. The following extracts are equal to the best sayings of Capt. Brown:-
Dec. 17th.-'I wish you a long life and a happy one, and in your last days the thought of having helped the world forward instead of back.'
'The bouquet you sent me is very beautiful. I have hung it up south of the window, over the little table I have to write upon. It always has a smile of love and kindness '
Jan. 31st.-'My trial comes on to-morrow. I shall soon know my destiny. I have not much hope of any thing but the better land'.
Feb. 5th.-'I hope your soul is so strong that sorrow cannot find a lodging there. I am cheerful and happy, patiently awaiting the fate of man-death.
Feb. 19th.-'I could bear all the sorrow of the world, if I had it on my shoulders.'
March 13th-'It makes ay soul overflow with sorrow to see men with great talents use them in defending what is both a <illegible> to themselves and to all mankind.'
'I have had a glorious time with my sister here: she is each a bundle of nerves, that I am almost ashamed of myself when compared with her. There is no greater joy on earth, for me, than to see a noble woman; for in her I see more of God than in any thing else.'
'I hope you will always, as yon love man, as you love God, work with hands, head and heart, for the happiness of all mankind.'
On the afternoon before the fatal day, a new visitor was admitted as a favored and welcome guest into the cell-Miss Jennie Dunbar, an intelligent and amiable young woman from Ashtabuls county, Ohio-who had just been to Richmond on a fruitless errand to plead for the prisoner's life. Her coming was not unexpected by Stephens, for frequent letters had passed between them, of such character as had served to strengthen a friendship, which, though it was not-as stated in the newspapers-an affianced love, was only made stronger by separation and misfortune. The prisoner regretted that she should have lost so much of the last remaining precious time to go on a useless journey to fall on her knees before as unpitying Governor of to unpitying State. She says that she had buoyed herself up with the hope of obtaining a pardon until the moment of her entering the Governor's of-

<c06>
fice in the Capital; 'but,' said she, ' he moment I looked into his eye, I saw that there was nothing in him to which I could make an appeal.' It is sufficient to say that she was coldly received and dismissed by the Governor, who had already taken the pains to say that he could not save the prisoner's life, and that he would not if he could.
On Friday morning, the two prisoners, in company with the two ladies and a brother of Hazlett, newly arrived, took breakfast, at one table, in the passage-way of the prison, before a final separation. Mrs. Pierce, on entering the cell, was so overcome by the sudden realization of her final visit, that she hastily retired until she could return with more composed feelings. Miss Dunbar burst into tears, but was soon calmed by her friend's cheerfulness of sprits. At an hour which he himself had previously appointed, a carriage was driven to the jail to convey the visitors away from the town, before the preparations for the execution were begun.

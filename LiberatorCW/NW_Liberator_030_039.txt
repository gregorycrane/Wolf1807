REFUGE OF OPPRESSION.
From the Journal of Commerce.
MRS. L.MARIA CHILD AGAIN.
The New York Journal of Commerce has recently published the same statement which we copied last winter, regarding the false philanthropy of Mrs. L. Maria Child, copied from a correspondent of the New Orleans picayune, to the effect that this lady has a suffering daughter at the South to whom she pays no bead, leaving her dependent upon the charity of strangers. While we do not admire Mrs. C., and have been taught to regard her opinions and her action touching the great modern martyr of crime at Harper's Ferry, as the most utter and pernicious ' twaddle' still we were willing to, and did, make amends for having been innocently misled by the statement in the Picayune, which proves to want any foundation.-<illegible>(Vt.)Sentinel.
In a note to the Editor of the Sentinel, Mrs. Child states that she always has been childless,-or rather, has been, up to the date of the note,- thus refuting the charge above referred to.-Journal of Commerce.
The main facts in the article in the Picayune are substantially correct, except that the lady referred to is not a daughter of Mrs. L. Maria Child. But she is young lady from Massachusetts, and spells her name Child instead of Child.
I am acquainted with the facts of the case, having myself taught school in the Leigh family (not Lee, as printed in the Journal of Commerce) previous to the employment of Miss Childs. I have lived in the vicinity ever since. Such acts of kindness as shown by the Leigh family to Miss Childs are acts of true benevolence, true philanthropy. It is not that misguided, morbid philanthropy exhibited by L. Maria Child when she hastened to the prison of John Brown, who was clearly proved to be guilty of murder,. bloodshed and treason, actuated, it may be, by the same morbid philanthropy that sent Mrs. Child to his prison. Abolition philanthropy is all morbid and false, though I do not doubt that Mrs. Child and thousands like her are Since in their acts. But could not Mrs. Child have found some objects of benevolence nearer home, even in Massachusetts, really needing assistance, who never had raised their hands to shed human bird, and were guilty of no crime, but were reduced to suffering and want by misfortune or the providence of God? I have seen many such cases in Massachusetts, where I formerly lived and received my education. But all such cases are overlooked by Abolition philanthropy. 'Distance lends enchantment to the view,' Charity with them never begins at home, but it must be lavished upon the negro of the South, who has more enjoyment and happiness than his master.
The worst enemy of the slave is the Abolitionist, such as Mrs. Child, Garrison, Giddings, Phillips, and other alike fanatical and misguided. They have done more to 'tighten the chains of the slave' than all the 'pro-slavery' men of the North. Before they commenced their privileges and liberty than now. There was an opportunity to teach them than mind write. But their incendiary publications scattered over the land, inciting the slave to bloodshed, murder and rebellion, closed the door to instructions in this way. What instructions they get now in morals and religion, is verbal.
In my younger and more ignorant days, I was a reader of Garrison's paper, the Liberator. Ignorant days. Yes, I say ignorant, though I had received a collegiate education. I was as truly ignorant of the system of slavery, socially and morally, as if I had been born and educated in Japan. The more I read such papers as the Liberator, the more really ignorant I became. I relied upon a blind, or false guide, or false guide, and found myself in the ditch. Yet this paper was not them near as ultra and seditious as now; not more so than many Republican papers of the present day. Garrisonism is the advanced guard of Republicanism; certainly as such Republicanism as is represented by Summer, Wilson, and Lovejoy. Conservative Republicans will halt when they once see where their advanced guard are leading them. But I did not take my pen to write on politics; I am no politican. I only wished to state that the Miss Childs above referred to was not the daughter of L. Maria Child. C.

From the New York Journal of Commerce.
To THE EDITORS:- The life of Abolitionism lies in this: that thousands of honest men do not see the reason why negroes should be legally held to labor of service, and therefore assume that no reason exists, and war against the Constitution and the law for upholding the rights of masters. We shall never have peace on the subject till be reason is pointed out. This I have briefly done in the following article; and I beg you to print it. No man can understand what I have written without admitting that our slave laws have a basis of justice, even though a had use may sometimes be made of them, even as bad land-owners can use their power for the oppression of the poor.
Negro slavery is not the only slavery, nor the worst. Every act of human government is necessarily, so far as it is operative, an abridgement of individual liberty, to be justified only on the score of public necessary, or the lack of wisdom and honesty on the part of individuals to practise self-government; i.e., to do what is wisest and best for themselves and for society without external force. The more 'liberty' the wicked and external force, the more slavery the inflict and suffer. Base natures suffer far more from too much liberty than from too little.
These are truisms, but the insanity of the age calls for their frequent utterance. False notions of liberty threaten the destruction of all liberty. We are already much more free than honest. If the abolitionists would but abolish Dishonestly, not only negro slavery but all slavery would abolish itself, and the Millenium would follow. H.

'SOUTHERN AGGRESSION.'
The Southern States of this confederacy have amount 4,000,000 negroes, African savages or their descendants, to deal with. To leave these negroes free to follow their own inclinations would be a virtual annexation of the Southern States to Hayti or to Congo; for it would establish the same state of thing there that exists in congo- free polygamy, free laziness, free staling from the nearest sheepfold or hen-roost, and free seizures of the most docile be the most savage, to be held as slaves. To save those states from such anarchy and barbarism, the civilized whites, by legal enactments, have sought to repress the liberty of idleness. They do not pursuit their savages to live as savages or as vagabonds, but encourage white men to take them into their fields, and set them at work. To overcome the constitutional laziness of the negro is no easy matter. To make a negro of the negro enough to pay for his housing and keeping from infancy to old age, is no easy matter. No white man can be expected to od it for nothing. To induce white men to do it, and to do it well, the law allows them a permanent property in every savage whom they redeem from
<c02>
barbarism and vagabondage, by teaching him to work at any honest or useful calling. The law, while requiring the white man to use his barbarians kindly, and to provide them with all the necessaries of life, gives him full power to direct the industry he may rescue from vagabondage, and to dispose of the rice and cotton that, but for him, would have never existed. Such were the laws and usages of every American colony and community, when the Declaration of Independence was written, and of every State South of Massachusetts for fifty years afterwards. Acting according to the laws and policy thus indicated by necessity, thousands of white men became voluntary teachers and guardians of beastly savages, whom they redeemed from all the worst evils of barbarism, and whose industrial energies, from being a waste or a curse, they converted into a mighty source of private and national wealth. The cotton and other products thus educed from barbarism have always been a chief, if not the sole support of our export trade, and thus an essential prop to our banking system, our domestic trade, and our whole system of commerce. Let this prop be withdrawn, and we should be at once precipitated into such a financial and commercial revulsion as we I have never yet known. One-half of our Territory would become an African jungle, where free laziness for negroes would result in free stealing for everybody, and civilization and industry would alike perish; while the other half would flounder in bankruptcy and anarchy for a life time, if not for ever.
The Southern States have uniformly resisted all attempts to demoralize and to run off their reclaimed savages, whether by Abolition Societies and negrostealers, or by demagogues and incendiaries; and it is their resistance to such attempts that constitutes the main staple of what their assailants term 'Southern Aggression.' If they have committed any other aggressions upon us, what are they? When have they, filled the mails with incendiary cuts and placards calculated to array Northern poverty and labor against Northern capitalists? When have they violated the Constitution by passing ' Personal Liberty Bills'? When have they sent fire-brands into our Northern factories, or got up John Brown expeditions to organize our social male contents into banditti? When did they forward strychnine to Northern servants, that they might poison their convinced masters? Let Seward, Weed and Greeley answer.
One point more. When we seek to make the slight necessity for special legislation in regard to negroes that is felt in States where the whites are to the negroes as 100 to 1, the rule whereby Southern legislators shall govern their action, do we not commit an 'aggression' upon the Southern States? Where a single negro is thrown among a hundred white men, there are many chances that the industrial momentum of the hundred may so far overcome the inertia of the one, as to make him earn his support without giving him a special guardian and master by law. There are many chances that some one of the hundred may learn him some useful employment out of charity, or from a hope of profiting by the teachings given to the negro, when the negro shall have learnt to work. And even should the negro grow up a mere vagrant and parasite, there are so many industrious white men around, for him to prey upon, that his pickings and stealings will not tall ruinously hard upon any one. But the case is very different in those States where negroes are found by the thousand. There is no alternative there, between discipline and barbarism. The industrial education of a negro multitude cannot be managed without fixed and responsible masters, endowed with all necessary authority by law, and stimulated by some surer reward than the chance wages to be derived from negro conscientiousness and negro gratitude. No man would house, and clothe, and feed a family of negroes from birth to maturity for such amount of work as they might please to give him alter they were grown up; yet the whole tendency of Abolitionism is, to require the Southern land-holders to do this, and to strip the negroes born at the South of all civilized protection and guidance, save such as the few white capitalists amongst whom they are scattered, may be able and willing to give them for nothing! Men at the North, who rarely allow a poor white family to live in one of their tenant houses a single month without paying a whacking rent, (often in advance,) demand that the Southern planters should harbor whole households of negroes all their life for nothing; for, whatever the professions or even the intentions of Northern meddlers may be, that would be the practical result of their measures. Why do men call such aggression as this, ' Southern Aggression '? J. H. H. 

SELECTIONS.
MASSACHUSETTS AND VIRGINIA.
THE MAY-FLOWER AT PLYMOUTH, AND THE FIRST SLAVE SHIP AT JAMESTOWN.
Extract from a speech delivered by Hon. CHARLES SUMNER, at a Republican Mass Meeting held at Myricks, on the 19th instant:-
As citizens of Massachusetts, our duties are identical, but reinforced by circumstances in her history: so that if, as men or as citizens of the United States, we might hesitate, yet, as citizens of Massachusetts, we are not allowed to hesitate. By the example of our fathers, who laid the foundations of our Commonwealth in knowledge and in justice-who built schools and set their faces against slavery -we are urged to special efforts. As their children, we must strive to develop and extend those principles, which they had so much at heart, and which constitute their true glory.
In the recent conflicts of party, it is common to heap insults upon Massachusetts. Hard words are often employed. Some of her own children turn against her. But it is in vain. From the past, learn the future. See how from the beginning she has led the way. This has been her office. She led in the long battle of argument, which ended in the war of Independence; so that European historians have called our Revolutionary Fathers simply ' the insurgents of Boston,' and have announced the object of the war as simply 'justice to Boston.' And she has led also in all enterprises of human improvement, especially in the establishment of public schools and the abolition of slavery. We are told that a little leaven shall leaven the whole lump, and it is the Massachusetts leaven which is now stirring the whole country. Wherever education is organized at the public expense, or human right are respected, there is seen the influence of Massachusetts, who has been not only school-master, but chain-breaker. Such are her titles. Men may rail but they cannot rail these away. Look at them in her history.
In the winter of 1620, the May-Flower landed its precious cargo at Plymouth Rock. This small band, cheered by the valedictory prayers of the Partisan pastor, John Robinson, braved sea and wilderness, for the sake of liberty. In this inspiration our Commonwealth began. That game year, another cargo, of another character, was landed at James town in Virginia. It was nineteen slaves-the first that ever touched and darkened our soil. Never in 
<c03>
history was greater contrast. There was the MayFlower, filled with men, intelligent, conscientious, prayerful-all braced to hardy industry-who before landing united in a written compact, by which they constituted themselves a 'civil body politic,' hound ' to frame just and equal laws.' And there was the slave ship, with its fetters, its chains, its bludgeons and its whips-with its wretched victims, forerunners of the long agony of the slave-trade, and with its wretched tyrants, rude, ignorant, profane,
Who had learned their only prayers From curses, and who carried in their hold that barbarous slavery, whose single object is to compel labor without wages, which no just and equal laws can sanction. Thus in the same year began two mighty influences; and these two influences still prevail for and wide throughout the country. But they have met at last in final grapple, and you and I are partakers in the holy conflict. The question is simply between the May-Flower and the slave-ship; which of the two to choose?
True to her origin, Massachusetts begin at once that noble system of Public Schools, which continues her ' peculiar institution.' 'After God,' said one of her early preachers in most affecting words, 'had carried us safe to New England, and we had builded our houses, provided necessaries for our livelihood, reared convenient places for God's worship, and settled the civil government, one of the first things we longed for and looked after was to advance learning and perpetuate it to 'posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches, when our present ministry shall lie in the dust.' In this spirit, it was ordered by the General Court as early as 1642, 'That in every town, the chosen men appointed for managing the prudential affairs of the same shall have power to take account of all parents and masters of their children, especially of their ability to read and understand the principles of religion and the capital laws of this country.' This was followed only a few years later, in 1647, by that famous law. which ordered every town with fifty households to have a common school' to teach all such children as shall resort to it to write and read,' and every town with one hundred households ' to set up a grammar school, the master thereof being able to instruct youth so far as they may be fitted for the university;' and this law in its preamble assigned as its object, to counteract ' one chief project of the old deluder Satan, to keep men from the knowledge of the Scriptures,' and also ' that learning may not be buried in the graves of our fathers, in the Church and Commonwealth.' To nothing in her history can Massachusetts look with more pride than to this commanding example, which, whenever followed, must open wide the gates of human improvement.
Nor is this all. Mindful that the press is the indispensable minister of good learning, one was established without delay. This was at Cambridge, as early as 1639, and the first thing printed was 'The Freeman's Oath.'
Meanwhile, the slave-ship had continued its voyages and discharged its baleful cargoes. Virginia' became a slave State, and the natural consequences of slavery ensued. Of course, the common school was unknown; for where slavery gives the law, the school-master is shut out. One of her Governors, Sir William Berkely, said, in 1671, ' I thank God there are no free schools, nor printing, and I hope we shall not have these hundred years, for learning has brought disobedience and heresy and seets into the world, and printing has divulged them and libels against the best government. God keep us' from both.' These remarkable words, which embodied the political philosophy of slavery, were addressed in an official reply to interrogatories propounded by the Privy Council in England.
Thus early was the contrast manifest, which has been increasing ever since. The evidence is unimpeachable, whether we consult the faithful historian who tells us that at the beginning of the last century, Boston alone contained five printing offices and many booksellers, while there was not a single bookseller in Virginia, Maryland or Carolina; or whether we consult the various statistics of the census in our day, where figures speak with most persuasive power for the May-Flower against the slave ship.
But while Massachusetts thus founded the School and the Printing Press, what was her course on Slavery? Alas! not all that we could wish; but still enough to make her an example. Unhappily slavery, although in a much mitigated form, came to be recognized here. But it never flourished, and it was from the beginning surrounded with impediments to its increase. To our glory, let it be known, that no person could be born a slave on our soil. This odious yoke was not transmissible in the blood. It ended with life, and did not visit itself upon the children of the slave-mother. It appears also that the slave could take and hold property,-which no American slave can now do. He could also testify in courts of justice, like a white man, which no American slave, nor colored person in a slave State, can now do. A slave, called ' Andrew,' Mr. Oliver Wendell's negro,' also 'Cato, a negro,' were witnesses on the great State Trial of the British soldiers in 1770, for what is known as the Boston Massacre. And still further, there were times when the negro, whether bond or free, was enlisted in the militia, and ' enjoined to attend trainings as well as the English.' Indeed, as early as 1643, on the musterroll of Plymouth is the name of ' Abraham Pease, the blackamore.' Thus, though slavery had a certain recognition, it did not give its unjust law to the body politic and to the social life of Massachusetts.
It was natural, therefore, that her General Court should bear witness against ' Man-stealing.' This it did as far back as 1646 in formal act, worthy of perpetual memory. A Boston ship had brought home two negroes kidnapped on the coast of Guinea, Thus spoke the Massachusetts of that day:-
'The General Court, conceiving themselves bound by the first opportunity to bear witness against the heinous and crying gin of man-stealing, also to prescribe such timely redress for what is past, and much law for the future as may sufficiently deter all those belonging to us to have to do in such vile and most odious conduct, justly abhorred of all good and that men, do order that the negro interpreter, with others unlawfully taken, be, by the first opportunity, at the charge of the country, for the present, sent to his native country of Guinea, and a letter with him of the indignation of the Court thereabout and justice thereof.'
Mark the energy of this language! Here is an example, more than a century before Clarkson or Wilberforce, which blasts with just indignation the horrid crime which now skulks beneath our national flag. The government that could issue this decree was inconsistent with itself when it allowed a single person bearing the upright form of man, to be held as a slave even for life anywhere within its jurisdiction.
But slavery flees before the school-master. As early as 1701, its injustice was formally declared by the' Town of Boston, whose records contain the following vote, proper for adoption at this day:
<c04>
'That the Representatives are desired to promote the bringing of white servants, and to put a period to negroes being slaves.' By this official corporate act, first of the kind in history, Boston stands foremost in the warfare with shivery. Let her be proud of this post. Her wealth may depart, her ware-houses may crumble, her ships may cease to cleave the seas with their keels, and her authors, too, may lose their charm; but this early record in behalf of justice and humanity will endure in never failing brightness.
Other official acts followed. In 1705, a heavy duty was imposed upon every negro imported into Massachusetts. In 1712, the importation of Indians as servants or slaves was strictly forbidden. But the small number of slaves and the mildness with which their condition was tempered, or, perhaps, a still immature public opinion, postponed definitive action on this great question until our own controversy with the mother country, when the rights of the blacks were blended by all true patriots with the rights of the whites. James Otis, in pleading for the colonies, denounced slavery of all kinds, while Samuel Adams said to his wife, who had brought into his house a slave for a servant, that whoever entered his house from that time for ward ceased to be a slave. Sparing all unnecessary details, suffice it to say, that, as early as 1769, one of the courts of Massachusetts, anticipating the renowned judgment in Somersett's case, established the principle of emancipation, and, under its touch of benign power, changed a slave into a freeman. In the same spirit voluntary manumissions took place, as by Jonathan Jackson, of Nawburyport, who, in a deed, which may be found in the Probate Records of the County of Suffolk, declared that it was ' in consideration of the impropriety, long felt in beholding any person in constant bondage, more especially at a time when his country is so warmly contending for the liberty every man ought to enjoy.' At last, in 1780, even before the triumph of Yorktown had assured that peace which set its seal upon our National Independence, Massachusetts, enlightened by her common schools, filled by the sentiment of freedom, and guided by her revolutionary patriots, placed in front of her bill of rights the emphatic words ' all men are born free and equal,' and by this solemn declaration, afterwards enforced by her courts, made slavery impossible within her borders. From that time it ceased to exist, so that the first census after the adoption of the Federal Constitution, in the enumeration of slaves, contains a blank against the name of Massachusetts; and this is the only State which has this honor. Thus, of old, did Massachusetts lead the way.
If all this he good for Massachusetts; if she has wisely rejected slavery, then is it her duty to do for others within the reach of her influence what she has done for herself. And here her sons have not always been remiss. Follow her history, and you shall find that, on the national field, they have stood forth for the good cause. In 1785, one of her representatives in the Continental Congress, the eminent Rufus King, at the time a citizen of the District of Maine, then a part of Massachusetts, moved the prohibition of slavery in the Territories of the United States; and in 1789, Nathan Dane, another of her representatives, reported the ordinance for the government of the Northwest Territory, containing this same prohibition. And, at a later day, when the Missouri Compromise was under discussion, that same son of Massachusetts, Rufus King, whose home was now transferred to New York, showed himself inflexible against all compromise with slavery, and in the Senate of the United States, with all his weight of years, character, and ability led the effort to restrict it. John Quincy Adams, another son of Massachusetts, was at the time Secretary of State, and he, too, enrolled himself on the same side. Afterwards, when the discussion of slavery was renewed in Congress, this same champion, then a representative from Massachusetts, entered the list for freedom, and in his old age, after having been President, achieved a second fame. Slavery, which was now exalted by its partisans as beneficent and just, he exposed in its enormity; the knot of slave-masters who had domineered over the country, he denounced with withering scorn, while ho vindicated the right of partition, which slave-masters as sailed, and upheld the primal truths of the Declaration of Independence, which slave-masters had audaciously denied. Thus constantly spoke Massachusetts, and in her voice was the voice of the May Flower against the slave ship.
Nor is this all. There is a common bond between the charities, so that one draws others in its train. And the grand charity for which we to-day bless our Commonwealth is only one of many for which she is now illustrious. Goodness grows by activity, and the moral and intellectual character which inspired Massachusetts to do what she has done for freedom, has made her active wherever the suffering are to be relieved, wherever the ignorant are to be taught, or wherever the lowly are to be elevated, and has enabled her, though small in extent and churlish in soil, to exert a wide-spread power. It is this character which has given her that name on the earth, which is a source of pride to her children. Strike out from her life all that is due to this influence, and how barren her history would seem! I do not say that her children would disown her; but they would hardly rise up and call her blessed, as they now do.
It belongs to us to keep Massachusetts in her present leading position; true to herself in all respects; true to that Spirit of Liberty in which she had her origin; true to the 'just and equal laws promised in the May-Flower; true, to her early and long-continued efforts against slavery; true to the declaration in her own Bill of Rights, by which slavery was abolished within her borders; true to the examples of her illustrious representatives, Rufus King, Nathan Dane and John Quincy Adam; and lastly, true to that moral and intellectual character, which has made her the home of generous charities, the nurse of true learning and the land of churches. This is our duty.

COLORED PEOPLE'S ADDRESS. 
Below will be found the correspondence that has taken place between Mr. Jones, a gentleman color, and the Governor General, touching presentation of an address from the colored population to the Prince of Wales. The documents will speak for themselves:-
LONDON, C. W., Aug. 24th, 1860. SIR.SIR,-Her Majesty's subjects of African decent, residing in the western portion of Canada, desire to present an address to His Royal Highness, the, Prince of Wales, on the occasion of his approaching visit to London.
Having been deputed by a committee to communicate with you, I have the honor to transmit to you a copy of the address which it is proposed to present, and respectfully request that you will form me whether we may consider that wo have permission of His Royal Highness to present this address, and at what time it is likely His Royal Highness will be in London, so as so afford us the opportunity. I may be allowed to add, that we have felt un-
<c05>
willing to occupy the time or attention of His Royal Highness by the presentation of a separate address, but we feel that there are circumstances connected with our position in Canada, which must render such an opportunity peculiarly acceptable to us. I have the honor to be, sir,
Your obedient humble servant,
(Signed.) A. T. JONES.
R. T. Pennefather, Esq., Civil Secretary, Quebec.
TO HIS HIGHNEESS, THE PRINCE OF WALES.
May it please His Royal Highness:
Her Majesty's subjects of African descent, residing in the Western portion of Canada, desire to welcome the arrival of your Royal Highness in this Province.
For ourselves and brethren of the same origin, we rejoice to have an opportunity to assure Her Majesty through your Royal Highness, of our devoted loyalty to the British Crown, and our admiration of the British Crown, and our admiration of the Christian and social virtues which so eminently adorn the personal character of our Gracious Sovereign.
The large majority of us were once slaves in another land, the victims of a cruel oppression, which proclaimed to us that, owing to our color, who had no claim to the ordinary rights of men, and were doome I to hopeless bondage.
But, blessed be God, there still remains a country on the North American continent, where the poor outcast slave can find a refuge from persecution, and claim the equal protection of laws which repudiate distinctions among men for the sake of color, and recognize the Divine announcement that God has made of one blood all nations to dwell on the face of the earth.
That country is now our home; many of us have sought it through great perils, and we rejoice to be permitted to account ourselves subjects of our beloved Queen, within the vast dominions which hail her beneficent sway.
 May God bless our Gracious Queen and Your Royal Highness!
OTTAWA, Sept. 1, 1860.
SIR,-I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th August, enclosing a copy of an address proposed to be presented to the Prince of Wales by that people of African descent residing in Western Canada.
 I am to inform you that His Royal Highness learns with much pleasure the assurances of loyalty continued in the address, bus that the address itself cannot be received. His Royal Highness desires to look at British subjects residing in Western Canada in one point of view, as owing the same allegiance to the British Crown, and enjoying the same privileges accruing from such allegiance. He declines, therefore, to recognize any attempt, which, by placing the body you represent in an isolated position, would present them in separate and distinct light from the present population.
I have the honor to be,
Your obedient servant,
R. T. PENNEFATHER, Gov. Sec.
A. T. Jones, Esq.

THE PRINCE AND THE COLORED PEOPLE'S ADDRESS.
The London Prototype appears to be much mistaken in the position he has taken in relation to the Address of the Colored People of that city to the Prince of Wales. And the pro-slavery press, both in the Province and in the United States, (for we fear that there are some of that stripe,) will fall into the sama error, even in this land. But we speak advisedly when we say, they are greatly mistaken; and for the very best reason that we can possibly give-viz. so far from placing as in any unfavorable position, we have to rejoice to find that all the proscription that the colored man meets with, on British soil, is from a succumbing spirit to the Slave Power of the neighboring republic. We give the reply of His Hon. the Governor's Secretary, which will be found in another column, but we give those who chuckle over it a nut to crack. 'His Royal Highness desires to look at all British subjects, raiding in Canada, in one point of view, as owing the same allegiance to the British Crown, and enjoying the same privileges accruing from such allegiance.' We dissatisfied at that Heaven-born declaration! As well the day be dissatisfied at the rising sun, as for any person to imagine that such a British sentiment as that could offend us! We offended at the very principles we have ever contended are the only true features of a free government! We ask no more. We hail it with rapture, proceeding from our future Sovereign. Let it be known in the streets of every town and village in the land, and let every school trustee, in every village and school-ward where the proscription of a man on account of color exists, proclaim that His Royal Highness declares  'British subjects in Canada, without respect to color, enjoy the same privileges as any others, and declines to recognize any attempt which would place the body in an isolated position from the rest of the population.' Wonder if His Highness will be allowed to stop in some places, after committing such an outrage on the tender feelings of sagacious officials whom we know of?- Windsor True Royalist.

LETTER OF GERRIT SMITH.
To the President of the Liberty Party Contention, to be held in Syracuse, August 29th, 1860.
Since the Autumn of 1858, I have not gone from home to attend a public meeting. All this time, until recently, my health has been poor. It is now vigorous. Nevertheless, my friends, and probably most other persons, would think it too soon after my entire prostration of both body and brain for me to be taking part in exciting public occasions.
What I have said will excuse me for not being at our Convention. Be assured that my absence from it is owing to no indifference to it. Yours is a Convention in behalf of realizing the just idea of civil government. Therefore am I deeply interested in it. Among all my conceptions of earthly good, civil government and the Christian church stand pre-eminent. As the church is the union of all, for the welfare of each, so also is the government. It is true that whilst the 'church is to look after the entire welfare of all within its care, the government is to do no more for its subjects than to protect their person and property. Nevertheless, it is to occupy its narrow range as faithfully and thoroughly as is the church its wide and limitless one. At the great heart of the church is to be ever concerned for the entire interests of all, so is the great power of government to be ever exerted to defend the person and property of all. I need not add, that such a church and such a government are yet to be seen. Hitherto, both church and government have been oppressors, instead of protectors. Hitherto, false religions, and, consequently, false politics have prevailed in all the earth. The day of superstitions and despotisms has not yet ended. That of the religion of reason and of Jesus Christ-that of the true church and the true government-has nots yet

begun. Or, if begun, it is but in the earliest morning twilight. Members of the church that now is, vote for slave-catching and dram-shop candidates. It is true that some of them do it with reluctance; and that some of them would not do it at all, were they not driven to it by party frenzy. Nevertheless, they do it; and that, too, in the face of their high pretensions of regard for temperance and freedom. Every church in the large denominations will so vote, at the coming election. Even Dr. Cheever's will. He will not himself, for he has in a good degree outgrown his religion. But the members of his church will, for they still make more account of the doctrinal than the practical. They still judge men more by their doctrines than their practices. Ho does not, and God bless him that he does not. As to the government, no more need be said indicate its character, than that it licenses dram-shops, and is the slaveholder's hound.
I trust that your Convention will make a national ticket, and also a New York State ticket. Not that I suppose either will get many votes; but that I warmly desire that the handful who wish to vote in accordance with the claims of absolute rectitude, of justice and mercy, may have the needed facilities for doing so. A man is made better and stronger by voting in the way his pure conscience bids him vote; find happy is the influence of his example on those who see him so vote.
Long ago did I become convinced that the American people have not virtue enough to impel them to vote against slavery and the dram-shop. The ballot-box, if used to that end, would speedily bring slavery to a peaceful death. But the ballot-box must be left to serve slavery, and slavery must be left to go out in blood. So, too, could the dram-shop be quickly voted to an end. Nevertheless, it will be left to manufacture paupers and madmen and blasphemers, to fill the land with peril to person and property; to take bread from the mouth of children and to break mothers' hearts.
As I view things, the Convention will do well not to call for any great outlay of time and money to increase the vote for its tickets. I have, from first to last, spent much time, and tens of thousands of dollars, in endeavors to increase our abolition and temperance vote. A little done in that way would have been well. But I did much more than was called for. The time and money were at least half waited. Two years ago, I was simple enough to hope that, by great effort, we could carry our abolition and temperance vote in this State up to thirty or forty, or even fifty thousand. I expended between four and five thousand dollars in hiring halls, and in paying printers and lecturers, &c.; and I went to fifty-four meetings, and begged, as on my knees, for votes. But, instead of getting so many as would encourage as to try the ballot-box again, we got so few (but five to six thousand) as to leave us but little hope of soon, if indeed of ever, getting more. I would go into a county, and not be able to find a single man to vote our ticket. I was everywhere met by old fellow-laborers in the cause of freedom and temperance, who, instead of giving me their co-operation, told me that I was ruining the Republican party. It seemed not to have occurred to them that the Republican party had ruined them. Nor did it seem to have occurred to them that freedom and temperance were better worth saving than the Republican party.
We do not need to employ presses and lecturers to convince the people that slavery and the dram-shop are among the greatest crimes and abominations. The people are already saturated with this conviction. But we do need to employ them to teach the people the true religion-the simple religion of reason, common sense, and Jesus Christ. Had they this religion, they would be drawn to rational and righteous voting, as naturally and necessarily as the needle is drawn to the pole.
You will need a fund of one or two hundred dollars to defray the expense of printing tickets, and getting them into the hands of suitable depositaries in different parts of the country, who, in their turn, will give them out to the half-dozen in this county and the dozen in that, who refuse to vote the tickets of any party which is so atheistic as to go but for white men, or so merciless as to recognize the lawfulness of slave-hunts, or sunk so low in its views of human dignity and human decency as to see in the dram-shop a human want. The enclosed draft for fifty dollars is my contribution to this end.
Think not that I shall be sorry to find your Convention refusing to partake of my tone of discouragement. I shall rejoice if it can see encouragement to undertake to obtain a considerable vote at the approaching election; and if it can feel itself warranted to entertain the hope of a speedy overthrow of slavery and the dram-shop by the force of political action, I stand ready to work with your Convention even against hope. To work with those who are endeavoring by peaceful means to rid the world of oppression and intemperance would do me good, and; them good, and the world good, even if the direct object of our work should remain entirely unaccomplished. Your friend,
GERRIT SMITH.
Peterboro', August 27, 1860.
 William Goodell, editor of The Principia, in a sharp review of Gerrit Smith's letter, says;-
We are not pleased with the idea of going into battle under the leadership of a General who tells his army, before hand, that he has little or no hope of ultimate success in the undertaking. That there is, indeed, no prospect of a successful issue of the great struggle between Despotism and Freedom, or even of making what worldly politicians would regard a respectable commencement of that struggle, during the pending Presidential contest, no one needs be told. But, in a world wherein the most glorious and enduring achievements in behalf of human progress, whether moral, religious or political, are almost uniformly connected with the feeblest and most derided beginnings, a world in which the most glorious and enduring achievement ever witnessed was by a leader with but twelve followers, all of whom, in the hour of peril, forsook him and fled-in such a world, in prosecution of the same enterprise, and under the same patronage and guidance, we can by no means consent to listen to the desponding tones of the leader selected for the present campaign. Nor. on the supposition that so desponding a leader was wisely selected, and that his proclamation of despondency was considerately and wisely emblazoned upon his banner, can we perceive the wisdom of selecting any leader, or of going into the battle at all. We are not certain that 'a man is made better and stronger' by a struggle of desperation, without faith or hope, or that 'a happy influence' is exerted by ' his example'-'on thaw who see him s thus struggling. Precisely the opposite effects we think we witness, daily, both upon those who thus labor, and upon those who witness such labors.
We hold to the sentiment of the old Roman, as paraphrased by Addison, that
Fear, admitted into public counsels, betrays. like treasons
We hold, on (to us) a far higher authority, that there are no moral victories for ' the fearful and un-

 NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
The United States Constitution is a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell.'
The free States are the guardians and essential supports of slavery. We are the jailers and constables of the institution.... There it some excuse for communities, when, under a generous impulse, they espouse the cause of the oppressed in other States, and by force restore their rights; but they are without excuse in aiding other States in binding on men an unrighteous yoke. On this subject, OUR FATHERS, IN FRAMING THE CONSTITUTOION, SWERVED FROM THE RIGHT. We their children, at the end of half a century, see the path of duty more clearly than they, and must walk in it. To this point the public mind has long been tending, and the time has come for looking at it fully. dispassionately, and with manly and Christian resolution.... No blessing of the Union can be a compensation for taking part in the enslaving of our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to be perpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that it can only continue through our participation in wrong doing. To this conviction the free States are tending,' - WILLIAM ELLERY CHAMMING.

believing'-shut up, as they are, to the alternation of turning aside in to crooked ways.
What cause, like discouragement, has paralyzed and thinned the ranks of radical abolitionists, for fifteen years past, and sent them running through the swampy thickets of expediency, after such will-o-wisps as Van Buren. Hale, and Fremont,(not to add Lincoln,) while notes of despondency and of semi-endorsements of such politicians have been continually sounding in their ears? Considering that those notes and semi-endorsements have come from their chief standard-bearer, after whose name they are commonly called, is it not almost a miracle that any of them still remain firm? Has the experiment of 'working against hope� proved a benefit, either to the worker, or to the lookers on? So long as the leader predicts defeat, is it creditable that a victory will be achieved? Was it thus that Joshua. Gideon, Jepthae, Sampson, Alexander, Caesar and Napoleon did exploits? Was it thus that Paul and Luther and Granville Sharpe triumphed?
The maxims of Christian heroism, �What ought to be done can be done�- �Expect great things, attempt great things'-have been pulled down, at Syracuse, and the watch-word, �Expect nothing, attempt little,' has been run up in their stead. Can men be blamed, if, with such a banner before them, they fail to enlist? Or that, if enlisted, they should obey marching orders,-and by attempting little, accomplish nothing? 
Excuse us, brethren. We have witnessed such experiments long enough, and too long, already. We cannot fight our battles under that banner. We had rather go �on our own hook.� We impugn the motives of no one. We censure no one. We withdraw friendship from no one. The brethren at Syracuse have done what they thought best. And so must we.
We cannot help to carry on a struggle at the ballot-box, with the understanding that it is to be a hopeless one, and that the bayonet of local resistance and bloodshed is, after all, to be the only hope for the slave or the country. We have no belief that a people, with the power of the ballot in their hands, and without faith, hope, courage and fidelity, to wield it wisely, will ever have the courage, skill, and love of freedom, to preserve or to regain their liberties by fighting for them. Taking the proceedings of the Syracuse Convention, as a whole, its resolutions and the letter of its Presidential candidate,-however the documents may have been intended,-we cannot read them into anything more hopeful than this. So far, at least, as the support of the Presidential candidate is concerned, we can see no better destiny in prospect, by his own showing. �To the sound of such a trumpet, who shall prepare himself for the battle, or for anything but ignominious flight? We want a Joshua and a Caleb, in whose sight the hosts of Israel, as compared with their enemies, are not �as grasshoppers,� but who will say to the people, �Let us go up at once, and possess the land, for we are well able to overcome it.�
Of Dr. Cheever himself, the letter says:-
�He will not, himself, vote for dram-shops and slave-catchers, for he has, in a good degree, outgrown his religion.�
Without stopping to inquire on what authority this distinction is made between the Church of the Puritans and Dr. Cheever, it is more directly to our purpose to ask what religion of Dr. Cheever it is, that he has in a good degree outgrown? Is it the religion of Justice and Mercy? Mr. Smith will not admit that this was his meaning. Was it any pro-slavery or anti-temperance religion that he formerly cherished? No. He never had any such religion. He has not changed his religion. He was early taught the religion of the Bible, in the orthodox exposition of it, and espoused it as the vital element and rule of his life. When the temperance enterprise began, be espoused the temperance cause. When the anti-slavery enterprise began, he espoused the abolition cause, (as George Thompson lately bore testimony in London,) about the time that Gerrit Smith has admitted that he did�because he believed the orthodox doctrine of regeneration, a change of heart, immediate and unconditional repentance, a doctrine derived from the Bible and from the orthodox exposition of it, a doctrine that, like all the other doctrines of Bible orthodoxy, is of the most vital practical bearing, a doctrine that cannot be heartily embraced and obeyed without producing the fruits of practical godliness, a doctrine congruous and in harmony with no intelligible system of religious instruction on earth, except the orthodox, one of the very shibboleths of the orthodox creed, as total abstinence is with the teetotalers-as immediate and unconditional emancipation is with abolitionists. By perseverance in this orthodox doctrine, and especially by a more vigorous and distinct application of it, to the great sin of our country, and invigorated by all the kindred orthodox doctrines, Dr. Cheever is now dealing death-blows upon the monster, not giving way to discouragement, and predicting that nothing can be accomplished.
The following is the first of three Letters(all of which we shall publish) from ERNEST NOEL. Esq., son of the Hon. and Rev. Baptist Noel, of England, respecting the Labor Question in the West Indies. They have been printed in tract form by the Ladies� Negro�s Friend Society at Birmingham, having first made their appearance in the Leeds Mercury. They were written after a recent visit to the island of Jamaica, and contain much interesting information respecting the true state of things in the British West Indies, and the results of the abolition of slavery.
LABOR IN THE WEST INDIES.
No. I.
To the Editors of the Leeds Mercury:
GENTLEMEN,-The subject of free labor in our West India colonies has lately received considerable attention, and as there appears to be some misapprehension in many quarters as to the real state both of the negroes and the plantations, I venture to lay before the public a few facts.
It is commonly asserted that free negroes will not work; that the price of sugar will not repay the cost of production in most of our West India colonies; and that free labor cannot compete with slave labor in these possessions without a large immigration from India or China.
I propose to consider these three statements as regards Jamaica, which, being the largest and at the same time least flourishing of the West India islands, deserves our attentive consideration.
During a visit to Jamaica last autumn, I sought with great care for the causes which have reduced this fine island to its present condition; and although I do not pretend to have discovered all, and indeed should hardly feel at liberty to mention some of the defects of government which may have tended to lessen its prosperity, yet I think a sufficient number can be shown to explain the melancholy position of its proprietors, and to remove the idea that the emancipation of the slaves has been the one fertile source of all its disasters. 
We will first investigate the charge that the free negroes will not work. It might be said, as a writer in the Times has suggested, that this would be nothing very strange, for where the inducements to a life of ease and idleness are so great, and the requirements of nature so easily supplied, it would be natural that a half civilized population should decline the labors of the sugar field. But natural as this might have been, it is not the fact. It may fairly be said that the negro has not the energy of the European, but it is far from true that he is the idle, indolent being some would have led us to believe. Abundant proof can be afforded of this. I would point at once to several thriving plantations in Jamaica as a convincing refutation. How is it, then, so many estates which under slavery were sending handsome returns to their proprietors in England, are now uncultivated, the owners perhaps ruined, and the population gone? It may be summed up in a few words, by saying that absenteeism, heavy mortgages, want of capital, bad management, unjust treatment of laborers, unpunctuality in paying wages, immoral conduct of overseers, want of cottages, and want of labor, have each contributed to bring the island into its present condition.
The subject of absenteeism has been so thoroughly discussed in relation to Ireland, that it is needless to say more than that its injurious effects are as plainly marked and as deeply felt in the West Indies as in our sister island.
Some estates have been abandoned-and I could name several-owing to the proprietor receiving nothing from his property, the whole profits being swallowed up by a heavy mortgage, and the mortgagee not being willing to invest more money or carry on the cultivation at his own risk. Such estates were not thrown out of cultivation from� want of labor.� Others were worked entirely by borrowed 
<c02> 
capital, paying high rates of interest; a single failure in the sugar crop would almost hopelessly involve the estate in debt.
Many more have been rained by gross mismanagement. Expensive machinery has been sent out from England, in some cases totally unfit for the purpose to which it was to be applied; in others the local managers were ignorant of its use, or refused to adopt w hat they considered worthless innovations. Such properties, bringing in but small and uncertain returns to their owners, have been in several cases abandoned.
On some estates there has been a real want of labor, but this in no way arising from either a want of population or the idleness of the negroes, but produced by the unjust and cruel treatment of the overseers, either during the time of apprenticeship or in the years immediately succeeding. This is a most important fact, and as most of the agents who were then employed have since died, and the properties have very generally changed hands, it is now forgotten, and nothing is thought of but the present melancholy result, that the fields are untilled, the population departed, and what was once a scene of busy life is now sinking back into an unpeopled wilderness. During the �apprenticeship,� not a few of the unprincipled managers of property, provoked and irritated at the thought that those whom they had so long regarded as mere property, cattle to do their work, were soon to be as free as themselves, instead of relaxing the treatment of their partially emancipated slaves, showed the most brutal severity, and felt towards their wretched victims, what one of them had the courage to express. When a miserable Christian negro by the order of a Christian magistrate was about to receive fifty lashes, he exclaimed, �I have got you for two years yet, and your life shall not be worth a farthing by that time.� Can it be wondered at that slaves thus used, having at length acquired their freedom, should refuse any longer to work for such masters? It is an ungrateful task to recall such scenes, but they must be remembered, or we shall not fairly estimate the causes which have contributed to the ruin of so many unfortunate holders of West Indian property. Another evident cause which led to this want of labor was the unwillingness of the masters at first to pay regularly and justly the wages due to their now free laborers.
On one property in Hanover, no negro received any payment in money for ten months, when a general defection took place; the laborers refusing any longer to work for the benefit of others, sought employment for themselves on land easily to be obtained among the hills.
On another property in St. James�s, six weeks and two months often elapsed without the payment of wages; and at the time of settlement, the negro�s knowledge of arithmetic being extremely limited, he constantly thought himself defrauded of his due, which produced such discontent, that, whole families emigrating to the hills, the property had to be thrown out of cultivation for� want of labor.� Nor are these isolated cases.
On other properties, where a similar complaint of �want of labor� was adduced as the cause of their present abandoned condition, I found that an attempt had been made to coerce the people, by mixing up rent and wages, charging arbitrary and exorbitant rents for cottages, if any in the family refused to work.
In conversation with some exceedingly intelligent negroes, I was informed that the gross immoralities of the overseers and bookkeepers prevented many negroes, who had become Christians, from permitting their children to work on such estates, saying it was better they should be somewhat poorer in circumstances than degraded and corrupted, ruined for this life and the next.
The want of suitable cottages near the cane-fields have in some places aided in diminishing the available labor, as the negroes refused to walk five and six miles to their work.
The length of this letter precludes my entering on the other branches of this subject, as I have already trespassed too long on your valuable space; but I hope to be permitted at some future time to continue this investigation. 
I remain, Gentlemen, yours obediently, 
ERNEST NO�L.

WM. S. BAILEY-CASSIUS M. CLAY.
To the Editor of the New York Tribune:
SIR,-Some time since you published a card from C. M. Clay, recalling his letters of commendation to myself. To correct wrong impressions where any might exist, permit me to state in reply that he requested me last Fall to abandon my(our) Kentucky Free-State Platform, stating that he(they of Madison County) had adopted simply the Philadelphia Republican Platform of 1856. So I republished said platform, for the sake of unity, as we expected to vote with the Republican party in 1860, acknowledging Mr. Clay as our leader, but did not abandon our Kentucky State Platform, as he requested, for I still thought that the citizens of Kentucky should take some State action for the final abolition of slavery among us, which, I thought, would be as consistent as it was for other States that had done so, and that are now free. I think so still.
At the Republican Convention held in Covington on the 26th of April, 1860, Mr. Clay professed the same friendship he had for many years previous, and parted with me in like manner at the close of the Convention. I never once dreamed that he held, inwardly, an unkind feeling toward me. But still it seems he went immediately home, and wrote the card referred to.
For us Kentuckians to raise our voice against the �extension� of slavery, and yet have nothing to say against the evil of it in our own midst, would be, I think, ridiculous before the world, and inconsistent with ourselves.
I have no apology to make to Mr. Clay for my course, and if he has none to make to me for his, I bid him farewell. His letter, I think, will do me but little harm. May it do as little to him. I wish him no ill. I have always been true to principle, and trust ever to remain so. But, I must say, his letter is a cold and unnatural thrust without causes. I have been his shield and helper, and now in a crushed condition and needy, he seeks my ruin.
Friends writing to me will please address Box No. 10, Covington, Ky., instead of Newport. Respectfully yours, 
WM. S. BAILEY.

THE WAY NORTHERN BUSINESS MEN ARE WELCOMED IN THE SOUTH.
The Utica Herald of the 21st has an account of the reception which Mr. John H. Keating, of that city, received recently at Savannah. Mr. Keating went to Georgia to canvass the State with a patent spring bed. He was a good Douglas Democrat, but he is now a Republican. The circumstances which caused him to change his politics are thus set forth in the Herald:-
�He sailed from New York on the 7th for Savannah, as has been stated. On the voyage a canvass of the passengers was taken to learn their political predilections, as is common in these days. Mr. Keating announced himself for Douglas; one of the passengers, a slaveholder, voted for Lincoln, and the rest were for Breckinridge and Bell. Arrived at Savannah, and having located himself at his hotel, Mr. Keating and several persons from New York were sent for by the authorities, and questioned as to their business, their residence, and their destination. They were acquitted of any suspicion of being abolition emissaries or distributors of incendiary documents. But they were notified that they must leave by the return of the steamer which brought them thither. No pedlers or sellers of patent rights from the North would be permitted at present to go through the State in the pursuit of their calling. This despotic command was rendered the more rigorous by facts which came to the ears of Mr. Keating and his companions. A Northern man at Aiken had been caught reading the New York Tribune, and was tarred and feathered. An old resident of Savannah who refused to join a club to supervise the opinions and conduct of citizens and strangers, and was therefore suspected of lacking zeal for the punishment of offenders against slavery, was compelled to abandon his business and migrate, to escape personal indignity and violence.
�So warned and commanded, Mr. Keating found it necessary to leave the State to which his business had called him. Rather than return home, he determined to go on to Louisiana, and had taken passage for New Orleans, when the captain of the vessel on which he was to sail warned him that he would find no less obstacles there in his way. It only remained for him to return to a State where men from whatever part of this or any other country may go where they list, and pursue an honest calling unshackled and free from such despotic surveillance.�

The Liberator.
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
BOSTON, SEPTEMBER 28, 1860.
THE TERRITORIAL ISSUE�THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, &c. 
We promised, last week, to examine the remaining postulates contained in the  �Address of the Free Constitutionalists to the People of the United States,� recently published in this city by Thayer & Eldridge. Here is what is said in regard to the Territorial issue with the Slave Power:-
�Whether a man, who is confessedly to be held as property, shall be so held in one place, rather than in another? in a State, rather than in a Territory? is a frivolous and impertinent question, in which the man himself can have no interest, and which is unworthy of a moment�s consideration at this time, if not at all times. If he is to be a slave at all, the locality in which he is to be held is a matter of no importance to him, and of little or no importance to the nation at large, or any of its people.�
We must strongly dissent from this reasoning. It is true, it may be a matter of little consequence to the slave, whether he is held in one locality or another; but it is a matter of the gravest concern to the South, whether the Territories shall be consecrated to freedom or to slavery-whether her slave system shall be kept within its present limits, or be permitted to extend indefinitely. She has not been aroused, and inflamed to madness, by a shadowy abstraction, but by the consciousness that, if she lose the Territories, the days of her supremacy are numbered. Her instinct is sure. She knows her wants and her necessities, and acts accordingly. She is alive to the fact that her system of slave labor soon exhausts the most fertile soil, and requires new lands by constant acquisition to prevent its final extinction. The border ruffian invasion of Kansas was not a wanton and gratuitous outrage on her part, but deemed by her essential to her continued domination over the whole country. To limit is, in process of time, to destroy her �peculiar institution�; hence her desperation and fury in view of the purpose to prevent the extension of slavery beyond her present boundaries. True, within those boundaries she has much unoccupied, and therefore unexhausted land, upon which she may drive additional millions of slaves to unrequited toil; but her feverish desire for expansion reveals its importance to her safety and power, and proves the issue to be one of the gravest consequences. Every new territory she can absorb, subjugate or annex, especially where soil and climate are favorable to slave productions, is a new lease of life for her slave system, against which appeals to reason and conscience are powerless. By the acquisition of Texas, that terrible system was mightily strengthened, new blood infused into all its veins, the market price of every slave materially enhanced, and the domestic and foreign slave trade stimulated to the highest activity. The political struggle, therefore, now shaking the country like an earthquake, is not at all with reference to �a frivolous and impertinent question,� but is in the nature of things-a part of 'the irrepressible conflict� between justice and injustice, right and wrong, liberty and despotism the product of the general moral agitation for the total and eternal abolition of chattel slavery in every part of the South. Hence the outlawry of the Republican party in every �slave State.
Moreover, with the acquisition of new Territories out of which to carve additional slave States adlibitum, comes not only a vast augmentation of value in existing slave property, but an essential and indispensable increase of political power in the hands of the slave oligarchy, to be wielded in Congress against whatever relates to the interests of the North.
If, therefore, the Republican party shall succeed in getting the reins of government into its own hands, and preserving the Territories absolutely and beyond a peradventure from the designs of the Slave Power, it will do no slight service to the cause of freedom; and to that extent, and for that reason, it has our sympathies and best wishes as against its three antagonistical and thoroughly pro-slavery rivals.
If this is our view of the present political struggle, it may be asked why we do not espouse the Republican party, and urge abolitionists to vote for its candidates. Our answer is, that the greater includes the less, and the immediate abolition of slavery is a matter of incomparably greater concern than 'an effort simply to prevent its extension; that �an ounce of remedy is worth a pound of cure'; that the slaveholding guarantees of the Constitution are such as morally to vitiate that instrument, and no party can be justified on any pretence in swearing to uphold it; that the North ought to take disunion ground at once, in order to clear her skirts of blood-guiltiness, instead of remaining an accomplice in slaveholding where it now exists at the South; that the result of such disunion must inevitably and speedily be the extinction of the slave system universally; and that to make no compromise with oppressors is to do the highest service to all classes and all interests in the land. It is not necessary for us to elucidate these points in this connexion, as it is our constant aim to show that upon the Northern banner should be inscribed the motto. �NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS!� and the battle carried to the gate.
The next position laid down in the pamphlet under consideration is, that, of all the contending political parties, �the Republican is the most thoroughly senseless, baseless, aimless, inconsistent and insincere.� Certainly, we are not called upon to be the defender or apologist of the Republican party; but we do not hesitate to say that such an impeachment is lacking in discrimination and justice. Should it succeed, it will be in the power of the Republican party to secure every Territory to the service of free labor and free institutions, in accordance with its platform; so that, to this extent, it is neither aimless nor baseless, and we trust it is not insincere. That the party is inconsistent, and morally condemned out of its own mouth, in resisting the extension of slavery on the ground of its being a curse and crime, and then supporting it where it exists and as it exists by constitutional agreement, is what we are constantly affirming nevertheless, heterogeneous as it is in its materials, conflicting as are the utterances of its prominent supporters, it so speaks and so acts as to cause the slave-traffickers to gnash their teeth, and the entire body of Southern ruffians to desire to administer lynch law to all who are connected with it. Even its Presidential candidate is an outlaw at the South, and avows that he cannot safely visit the graves of his relatives in that section! What if Mr. Seward, Mr. Sumner, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Burlingame, Mr. Hale, or any other leading Republican, should presume to advocate Mr. Lincoln's election at Richmond, Savannah, Mobile, or New Orleans? In all probability, death would be the consequence! (1)
(1) The spirit of the whole South, in reference to the Republican party, is comprehensively evinced in the following paragraph from the New Orleans Commercial Bulletin:-
�The first object of the Constitutional Union men of the South is to defeat Lincoln. This is the object of all of them, without a single exception; and it is so, because they know the dangers that would attend his election; they know that his election would be a great national calamity, to be deplored and dreaded by every lover of his country. Hence, their intention is to defeat him. They will leave no stone unturned to accomplish that object; and-what is more, they expect to succeed in their patriotic work �Where they can better accomplish their object of defeating Lincoln by fusing with other parties opposed to him, they will fuse; and where they can best do it by not fusing, they will refuse to fuse. But they intend to defeat Lincoln, for they know that his election would be a curse, an unmitigated curse to the country. And they will do it. That is the logic of the whole discussion in a nutshell.
<c04>
It is too palpable for denial, that the Republican party embraces almost every man at the North who is anxious to prevent the further extension of slavery; whereas all the other parties are made up of those who are eager and venomous for the suppression of the anti-slavery agitation in all its phases. Hence, we cannot agree with the fourth proposition in this Address, that �the great object should be to procure the defeat of the Republicans, and let either of the other parties win the victory! For it is not the object of the abolition movement to put up or to put down any political party as such; but, holding the scales of justice impartially, it is to create such a moral and religions sentiment against slavery as shall mould all parties and sects to effect its overthrow.
Finally, the Address recommends that a new party should be organized on the basis of the unconstitutionality of slavery wherever it exists. We deem it a waste of time and effort to do this-an historical absurdity, and an unwarrantable assumption. We are not only willing to concede, but entertain no doubt whatever, that the American people have intelligently understood, correctly interpreted, and consistently applied their own Constitution, ever since its adoption till now, in its relation to slavery; and therefore we shall not try to convict them of ignorance or delusion in this matter, but, taking them at their word, and pointing to their pro-slavery deeds, shall continue to show them their guilt, and call upon them to repent, by annulling their �covenant with death,� and instituting a new government based upon universal liberty.

This indomitable, true-hearted, untiring friend of impartial freedom is now in this city, hoping to receive such �material aid' as will enable him to resume the publication of his fearless and well-conducted paper, �The Free South,� in Newport, Kentucky. Again and again has his printing-office been destroyed by the mob  the lives of himself and family put in imminent peril-and every device of, satanic, pro-slavery malignity resorted to, in order to suppress his paper, and drive him from the State. But he has maintained his ground with heroic courage, martyr-like endurance, and noble self-sacrifice; and he will still keep at his post, provided he can obtain new printing materials for those the mob threw into the Ohio river. These he ought to have without delay. Help him generously, friends of humanity!

RICH DEVELOPMENT-THE CASE OF CHARILES WAGGONER. Attention is directed to the card from Dr. J. Q. A. Foster, of Newport, Ky., under the head of �Personal,� in our advertising columns. It appertains to certain matters interesting to himself, to Sheriff Helm of Campbell county, and to the public. Dr. Foster tells who shared with him the �blood-money� which was realized in the sale of the kidnapped negro, Charles Waggoner. The card requires no comment. It is sworn to, and it speaks for itself:
A CARD.
NEWPORT, Ky., July 29, 1860.
My apology for giving publicity to the following facts concerning some of the acts of H. D. Helm is, that I consider the manner in which he has treated me has absolved me from any obligation longer to shield him or his doings from the public view. I made a verbal statement of some of these matters, a few days since, to some of my friends, and I should not now have published them, had I not heard that he has, when I was not present, denied the truth of some of my statements.
I have, as is well known, been a firm supporter of him for office ever since he first ran for one, and now, because I was unwilling to go around endorsing his action in betraying his constituents at Charleston and Baltimore, he makes, as he declares, a personal matter of it.
Some two years since, this H. D. Helm originated a secret organization, to be composed of several influential Democrats in each precinct, who were bound by a written compact to abide the will of a majority of the members in all cases; and it was their business to see that the conventions in the county were packed so as to insure the nomination of the persons previously agreed on, and they were pledged to stand by each other, and keep one another in office. This clique is still in existence, nearly all the members are now in office, and all, except perhaps two, are supporting the same candidates for office at the coming election.
Any one desirous of seeing who were members of this body will find the compact in possession of Helm, in his own hand-writing, and his is the first signature to it, unless he has very recently disposed of it.
Again, every one in this community knows that I purchased the colored boy known as Charles Waggoner, who was sold by the Sheriff about the first of June last; but it has not been known until now, that the Sheriff was in partnership with me in that purchase; yet such was the fact, and we were to share equally the profits of the transaction. This will account for some things that before were not understood by the public.
J. Q. A. FOSTER.
STATE OF KENTUKY, CAMPBELL CO. ss. Sworn to before me, by J. Q. A. Foster, this 29th day of July, 1860.
I. B. PAYNE, J. P. C. C.
We learn from the Free South of August 20th, published by Wm. Shreve Bailey, at Newport, Ky., that this J. Q. A. Foster, Postmaster at Newport, was one of the leading men in mobbing Mr. Bailey�s office, and advertised in some of the Cincinnati papers as one of �the respectable citizens of Newport.�' And we learn from the same paper that Sheriff Helm, whom Postmaster Foster exposes, above, absented himself from the mobbing of Mr. Bailey's office, that Foster and other respectable citizens might accomplish the destruction of the Free South without official hindrance.
The following is an extract from Sheriff Helm's reply to Postmaster Foster:-
NEWPORT, Ky., July 30.
To the Editor of the Commercial:
J. Q. A. Foster, Postmaster at this place, in a card dated on yesterday, and published by you to-day, makes certain charges against me which it becomes necessary I should notice, only because his statement may be read by persons who do not know that individual, and might construe my silence into an admission of his false charges.
J. Q. A. Foster prefaces his statement by an apology which could have been better made for him by those who have witnessed the gradual self-destruction of that once gentleman, but now almost demented inebriate, in the fact that he is not responsible for his statement.
If the testimony of these men is worth anything against each other, they are both bad characters. If then word is of no account, they are unworthy of notice.
Again: Mr. J. R. Hallam (not Helm) was the chosen leader of the mob, and directed the attack upon Mr. B's office, and consequent destruction. After this chivalrous fete of Mr. Hallam, the Governor of Kentucky appointed him Magistrate to fill a vacancy in Newport. When the Free South was revived, on the appearance of the first issue, this Mr. Hallam caused the arrest of Mr. Bailey, charging him with issuing an incendiary paper, and, sitting as one of the two Justices of the examining Court, held him in the sum of $1000, to appear at the next November term of the Circuit Court.
On the same day of the arrest, before the trial, 'Squire Hallam expressed an opinion against the right to suffer the publication of the Free South, and in favor of prosecuting Mr. B. Upon this ground, together with his being the leader of the mob as above named, Mr. Bailey made oath that he did not believe Mr. Hallam would or could do him justice: but, in the face of this, he persisted in sitting to try the case, and of course decided that Mr. Bailey was guilty of publishing an incendiary paper.
Again, says the Free South, �Let it be remembered that the Bank charter granted by the Legislature last winter to certain parties in Newport, was on condition that the Free South newspaper be destroyed. Hence it has the name of the �Mob Law Charter
<c05>
Bank.�� One of its conductors, (J. A. Piner,) says Mr. Bailey, was a leading man in the mob. He was published by Mr. Bailey, some years ago as a swindler and man of bad character, for which he sued Mr. B., setting his damages at $20,000; but when the case was tried in the Covington Circuit Court, the jury decided his character not to be worth one cent.
Such is the character of some of those who denounce Mr. Bailey, and then, to injure him abroad, get themselves published as the �respectable citizens of Newport.�

DECEIT OF THE APOLOGISTS FOR SLAVERY.
Slavery is carried on by force. The defence of slaveholding is carried on by fraud.
The force which keeps men enslaved is not necessarily accompanied by noise, open conflict, or tumult. Its operation, like that of the steam-engine in the mint, is likely to be quiet and noiseless when most effective. The perfect success of tyranny in Warsaw was established at the moment when �order� was said to reign there. The show plantations at the South-those to which visitors like person Adams are invited to see the �patriarchal� character of slavery, and its adaptation to the best interest of the slave-are those in which resistance or escape is felt to be hopeless for the present, and the slave has no alternative except to die under the lash or put on the appearance of acquiescence in his condition, and say �yes� to all the villanous leading questions by which his master�s visitors extract their evidence of his �perfect contentment� 
The statements made in justification of slavery consist mainly of direct and enormous falsehood, though a little truth is generally mixed in, like hair with mortar, to give it coherence. The fraud is most enormous, and most unblushing, in the pious defences of slavery, and in the statements, generally, respecting it, made by the organs of piety. Such is the article from the Journal of Commerce headed �Southern Aggression,� which will be found on our first page in the �Refuge of Oppression.�
The preface to this article assumes the slave�s privation of liberty to be the same in kind with the concessions made by every man in society, of some fractional parts of his individual liberty and convenience for the common good. The apprentice or journeyman in a carpenter�s shop is not allowed to throw his lighted cigar among the shavings. The truckman, in a city, is required to keep on the right side of the street, and forbidden to keep on the left. Their natural liberty is, to this extent, abridged. But their consent to this abridgment is shown by their remaining in the particular society in question, when they are perfectly free to go into some other, or into solitude. When the slave shall have perfect freedom of removal, with his father and mother, his wife and children, we shall be able to judge of his �contentment.� Until then, a classification of his bondage with the limitations inherent in free society is one of the most monstrous of cheats.
The body of this article proceeds to assume, as not only true but obvious, the following utterly false positions:-
That a removal of the restraints of slavery would leave the slaves absolutely without restraint:-
That the motive for holding the slave in bondage is a virtuous horror of indolence felt by the master:-
That the negro has a �constitutional laziness� entirely different from the indisposition of the white man to work at unprofitable labor:-
That Abolitionism demands of Southern landholders a gratuitous housing, clothing and feeding of negroes, from birth to maturity-a harboring of them all their lives for nothing:-
That the provisions of the slave-code are designed, primarily, for the benefit of the slave:-
That they are really suited to promote the welfare of the slave:-
That these arrangements are a voluntary beneficence on the part of slaveholders:-
That they are also an imperative social necessity, the only remedy against worse evils:-
That the slave-code requires kind usage of the slave:-
That the master actually bestows upon him kind usage:-
That civilization and industry in the South require the continuance of slavery:-
That bankruptcy and anarchy would be insured, for a life-time, to the whites, and free laziness and free stealing, for a like period, to the blacks, by the abolition of slavery:-
That the negro is �reclaimed� by slavery, �demoralized� by freedom:-
That the helping of the negro to what he seeks as an improved condition is Northern aggression and that the intimation, in speech, writing or printing, of his right to seek for himself an improved condition, is also Northern aggression:-
That the forbearance of the South to circulate �incendiary cuts and placards,� inciting the Northern laborer against his employer, is a benevolent and beneficent forbearance:-
That help sent from the South to Northern laborers who need help, or suggestions to them of methods whereby their condition could be improved, would be an injury to Northern employers, and would be resented and opposed as such:-finally-
That the existing system of slavery is fairly called �an industrial education� of the negro race: that it is meant for education, in the ordinary meaning of that word! that it promotes industry, in the ordinary meaning of that word! that its jurisdiction includes only negroes! and that the laziness of �free� white men is harmless, working no such evils, and needing no such interference, as that of the slaves, including those who-as numerous advertisements in the Southern papers tell us-�try to pass themselves off for white.-C.K.W.

THE FRATERNITY LECTURES.
The series of Lectures established by �The Fraternity� of the 28th Congregational Society of Boston has for two years past been far the best, as well as the cheapest, which has been offered to the Boston public; and their audiences, filling the Tremont Temple at an early hour, have given the highest proof of their attractiveness. 
The programme for the present season(which has heretofore appeared in the Liberator) is not inferior in excellence, or in variety, to either of its predecessors. It comprises thirteen lectures, the first to be given by Charles Sumner on the first Monday in October. The tickets were actively called for as soon as they were announced, and probably all are already taken up. 
�The Fraternity�(an Association for recreation, social culture, and development in manly and womanly excellence of every kind, composed of such members of the 28th Congregational Society as wish to join it,) is one of many monuments of the high and noble influence exercised by Theodore Parker upon those around him. It was formed, not at his request, but by the spontaneous action of those who had been accustomed to hear him preach, and to feel the force of his oft repeated declaration that the business of the human being in this world was to use, develop and improve all parts of the nature which God has given him. With the increased numbers of this Society has come a widening of the sphere of their operations, and this series of Lectures, the richest in noble and suggestive thoughts ever given to the people of Boston, is only one of the methods by which their cooperation is made a blessing to the community.
The last weekly meeting of the Fraternity was made even more than usually attractive by the presentation of some tokens of their regard to Mr. John R. Manley, a gentleman whose active and constant services, gratuitously given, have been most helpful towards the prosperity and usefulness of that Association, and also of the 28th Congregational Society, from the com-
<c06>
mencement of each. These gifts, which were made a surprise as well as a pleasure to the recipient, consisted of beautiful pictures, valuable books, (one of them Ripley and Dana�s New Cyclopedia, now in course of publication, of which but ten volumes, about a third part of the whole, have yet appeared,)and a most elegant and commodious chair, capable of various convenient modifications, and suited to promote the comfort of Mr. Manley�s invalid wife so well as his own. After the presentation(and the appropriate acknowledgement) of these articles at the Fraternity meeting, they were carried in procession to the house of Mr. Manley, where the busters of them were invited to another festive meeting, of most agreeable character,-C.K.W.

SOUTHERN LITERATURE.
The Journal of Commerce, seeming to think that Southern Literature needs to be �cracked up,� gives an article enumerating its recent and prospective triumphs, commencing with the declaration-�The Southern mind is prolific of books.�
Since we have often to notice deficiencies and imperfections in the South, it is but candid to make mention of those departments in which she is distinguished and preeminent. We therefore print, below, the entire catalogue of works actually published �within the year,� and set forth under the distinctive title of 'Southern Literature' by the Journal of Commerce. Our space does not suffice for the adjectives with which the writer profusely besprinkles the books and their authors.
The books in question are all novels, with the following titles, namely:�
Beulah,
Rutledge,
The Actress in High Life,
The Household of Bouvene,
Nemesis.
All these, the exultant writer remarks, supporting his fact with a note of admiration-are from the pens of Southern women!�
�And,� he proceeds, �the chronicle does not end here.� We should hope not, after such a blowing of trumpets at the beginning. In fact, he mentions the titles of several other books. But as none of them are yet before the public, the writer claiming only that some are in press, some about to be published, and others about to be written, we postpone the remainder of the catalogue to another opportunity.-C. K. W.

COOL AS A CUCUMBER.
Readers of the Liberator may remember that at the Annual Meeting of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions a year ago, in the city of Philadelphia, the efforts of Dr. Cheever to cause some modification in the pro-slavery policy of that body were opposed, not only by the accustomed directors of that policy, but by an English clergyman, Rev. Dr. Waddington of London, who chanced then to be in our country. On his return to England, he was called to account for this treachery to religion and humanity He replied by gross calumnies against the abolitionists, both in London newspapers and in the Observer and Independent in this country, but was put to open shame by the exposure of his fraternization with the most thorough clerical defenders of slavery(for pecuniary purposes) during the whole of his American tour.
The visit of Dr. Cheever to England has compelled the clerical opposers of anti-slavery, there as well as here, to adopt new tactics; since their calumnies against the friends of the American Anti-Slavery Society would be as destitute of plausibility as of truth if applied to Dr. Cheever, and they must therefore confine themselves to countermining, instead of directly opposing him. The Independent has for some time been diligent in this work, and its efforts are now aided by a letter from the very Dr. Waddington above referred to, who is called by that paper(20th inst.) �an English emancipationist.�
In this letter, Dr. Waddington represents the reception of Dr. Cheever by the Congregational leaders in London as a �cautious� one. He says-�They were evidently unprepared to fraternize with the Garrisonian school, though ready to welcome the<illegible> of America�-and he names Rev. Dr. Campbell, Rev. George Smith, and Rev. John Stoughton, as those who particularly displayed the cautiousness referred to.
Dr. Waddington's letter, however, is especially noteworthy for the refreshing coolness with which he classes himself among 'earnest friends of emancipation�-laments the apathy of the British public upon the question of slavery-fears that Dr. Cheever will find himself greatly disappointed in the standing and influence of English abolitionists-finds it unaccountable that a cause so sacred and so inspiring should have been �left to its present leaders�-does not remember(!) an anti-slavery meeting of any importance there within the last ten years-complains of the little maneuvers to excite public notice, and the frivolous acts of annoyance to religious societies,(by which he probably means the exposure of false pretenders like himself, and Dr. Pomroy, and Dr. Barstow, and Dr. Murray)--and finally admits, with deceitful mock-humility, �You are ahead of us there immeasurably. 'Even your negroes surpass us the eloquence with which they assert their own rights, and in them those of our common humanity.�
One great advantage of Dr. Cheever�s visit to England will be the necessity that will thereby be imposed upon time-servers like Dr. Waddington, of getting into line with the anti-slavery movement. At present they throw in its way what obstruction they can, but when the tide turns, those very persons will make themselves conspicuous in moving with it.-C. K. W.
NEW TRACTS. Two other valuable tracts have just been published by the American Anti-Slavery Society, in connection with the series already given to the public. These are-
1.'Testimonies of Capt. John Brown at Harper�s Ferry, with his Address to the Court. He, being dead, yet speaketh.� These Testimonies have been selected from various Letters written by Capt. Brown, while lying under sentence of death for his brave and disinterested efforts in behalf of the imbruted slaves in Virginia. They make a tract of 16 pages, and deserve to be read and pondered by the whole American people.
2.'The Patriarchal Institution, as described by Members of its own Family. Compiled by L. Maria Child. This makes a tract of 55 pages, and furnishes a compendious and admirable text-book for all such as are actively engaged in the Anti-Slavery struggle. The first chapter is entitled �Southern Prophecies contained in the warning language of Jefferson, William Pinckney, Patrick Henry, Luther Martin, &c, respecting the dangerous and destructive tenderness of slavery. The second chapter presents the Southern fulfilment of those prophecies. Chapter third-�Southern statements of the happiness of slaves.� Chapter fourth-�Southern proofs that slaves are contented and happy.� Chapter fifth-�Southern proofs of the chivalrous and high-minded character produced by slavery,� Chapter sixth-�Southern proofs that slavery is a parental relation.�  Chapter seventh-�Southern proofs that the moral condition of slaves is better than that of Northern laborers.� Chapter eighth-�Southern prospects for Northern laborers and mechanics.� Chapter ninth-�Southern testimony concerning the effects of slavery on States. Chapter tenth-�Southern opinions concerning the extension of slavery.� Chapter eleventh-�Southern and Northern Democrats now leagued for the extension of slavery�-with concluding remarks by Mrs. Child.
The admirable paper upon THEODORE PARKER which we have copied from the October number of the Atlantic Monthly, and which may be found on our fourth page, is from the pen of T. W. Higginson.

PROPOSITIONS RESECTING SLAVERY AND THE CONSTITUTION.
1st GENERAL.
(a) The  the primal object, of all constitutional law, is natural justice. To secure this is the universally admitted object of all human government.
(b) All legislators and jurists acknowledge themselves bound, both in making, interpreting and applying constitutions and statutes, to conform to the admitted principles of natural justice, and, as far as possible, to prevent their violation.
(c) All great social wrongs spring up gradually, and continue to exist, in opposition to natural justice; most of them by sufferance, in opposition to the acknowledged principles of natural justice where they do exist. Not a few are suffered to be continued, and even protected, while both the moral sense of the community and the enacted constitutional law are opposed to them. Such was the case with slavery under the British government in England, until the Somerset decision by Lord Mansfield; and subsequently in the American Colonies, subject to the same constitutional English law. Such was also the case with slavery in Massachusetts, from the adoption of its Constitution until it was officially pronounced unconstitutional, and so abolished in the State.
(d) History, as well as common sense, teaches that great social wrongs are never voluntarily abandoned or abolished, while the people are ignorant that they are wrongs; that when they are  to be such, however clearly, they are seldom and with much difficulty abolished, while the fundamental law of the  is supposed to favor them; but, when both natural  and the constitutional law are seen to be opposed to them, they are usually very easily and readily abolished. Moral conviction is a great power opposed to social wrong; but moral and legal conviction combined against: any social wrong is a power doubly great-irresistable
24 SPECIAL
(a) From its first introduction to the present time, there has not been enacted the first syllable of law for the establishment of slavery in this country, either in the Colonies or in the States. This proposition is make on the assertion of Senator Mason of Virginia, Hon.Mr Gurney of Alabama, and other able advocates of slavery, as well as that of many others opposed to it.
(b) The Common Law decision of Lord Mansfield in the Somerset case, declaring that slavery is an institution so odious that nothing, except positive law, can make its existence legal, applied as legitimately to slavery in the British Colonies of America as to slavery on the British islands of Europe, and made slavery illegal here as well as there.
(c) The Declaration of Independence was virtually a proclamation of liberty to every slave in the  It was, in fact, the fundamental  constitutional law of the Confederated Colonies during the revolution and, therefore, made slavery illegal, no matter what its previous condition. No matter what the people who adopted it meant by it, its language is sufficiently clear, and its legal force is unavoidable. So the Constitution of Massachusetts, adopting the same language in its preamble, was subsequently applied to the abolition of slavery in the State, without any sort of inquiry as to what the slaveholding or  portion of the community intended or thought when they adopted it. When jurists and the courts are honest, and when great human rights are at stake, and the language of the statute is clear enough, they never ask'what the framers intended.
(d) Nobody contends that the plain, unequivocal letter of the Constitution recognizes slavery as a legally existing institution, or that it was the intention either of the framers, or of the people who adopted it, to make a legal recognition of slavery in such a sense as to establish slavery legally where it previously had no legal existence. But if the Constitution makes any legal recognition of slavery in any of the States, then it there establishes slavery, because slavery had there previously no legal existence. Nor has it since been established by any law in any of the States. Hence,proposition 
(e) The Constitution cannot recognize slavery to be a legally existing institution, except in itself, thereby establishing its legality, and therefore establishing slavery itself.
(f) The just and acknowledged rules of interpretation of all statute law require that, if possible, if the language be irresistibly clear, and unsusceptible of any other construction, does not demand it, no self-evident truth, no natural right shall be violated; and, consequently, that no such requirement can be found within any statute by any aid foreign to the letter itself.' There is not a word in the Constitution of the United States apparently bearing upon the condition of slavery, nor is there a provision but would be susceptible of practical execution, if there was not a slave in the land.'-[John Quincy Adams.]
3d. The history of the Constitution-its powers- its adoption-the people-what they thought of it, and intended by it-the practice of the government, &c., &c.,.-these things have no legitimate bearing upon the legal meaning we are justly and legally bound to accept from the language of the Constitution itself, as it was manifestly the purpose of all to express their final intention and meaning in the unambiguous words of the instrument, and at once and forever exclude all such outside influence, preserving their then expressed intention through all time. If a few of the framers intended to use ambiguous or circuitous language-and we know they did so intend-for the sake of shielding a great and at the time almost universally admitted wrong-be it remembered to their shame-we have no right to bring a worse shame upon ourselves by supposing that all the people who adopted the Constitution so intended, and by violating all acknowledged principles of just legal interpretation in construing that ambiguous language to favor the great wrong, and so  it in our day, when it has become tenfold greater.
But a few propositions as to the framers:-
(a) Some of them' thought it wrong to admit into the Constitution the idea that there could be property in man.'
(b) In the famous importation clause, the word  was unanimously objected to by vote of the Convention.
(c) In another clause,'the word" servitude" was struck out, and"service" unanimously inserted-the  being thought to express the condition of slaves, and the latter the obligation of free persons.'
(d) Of the famous fugitive clause,'the term"legally" was struck out, and the words, under the laws thereof, inserted after the word"State," in compliance with the wish of some who thought the term legal equivocal, and favoring the idea that slavery was legal in a moral view.'
In the Virginia Convention for its ratification, Mr. George Mason said-' There is no clause in the Constitution that will prevent the Northern and Eastern States from meddling with our whole property of that kind. There ought to be clause in the Constitution to secure us that property. There is no clause in the Constitution to secure it.'
Mr. Henry, in the same Convention, said:-
'Among ten thousand implied powers which they (Congress) may assume, they may, if we be engaged in war, liberate every one of your slaves, if they please; and this must and will be done by men, a majority of whom have not a common interest with you.. thing will contribute to bring this event about:-slavery is detested-we feel its fatal effects- we deplore it, with all the pity of humanity. Let all these considerations, at some future period, press with full force on the minds of Congress; let the urbanity, which I trust will distinguish America, and the necessity national defence. let all these things operate on their minds, they will search that paper, and see if they have the power of manumission. And have they not, sir? Have they not power to provide for the general defence and welfare? May
<c02>
they not think that these call for the abolition of slavery May they not pronounce all  free, and will they not be warranted in that power? There is no ambiguous implication or  The paper speaks to the point. THEY HAVE THE POWER, IN CLEAR, UNEQUIVOCAL TERMS, and will clearly and certainly exercise it.'
This opinion as to the Constitution, and the power of the Federal Government to abolish slavery under it, thus expressed at the time by slaveholders themselves, proves the utter falsity and nonsense of the often repeated assumption that, at the time of its adoption, nobody thought it gave Congress power to abolish slavery in the States.
Mr. Spooner himself does not go beyond this assertion of Patrick Henry of Virginia; and were Patrick Henry and George Mason the only persons who held these views of the  No! we could name many more. But, we repeat, all these outside expressions of opinions and intentions have no sort of legitimate bearing upon the meaning of the instrument itself. That is strictly, a legal instrument, and we are bound to construe it agreeably to the just rules of legal interpretation, which require us to save liberty and all natural right, if the expressed terms do not necessarily forbid.

CAPE COD CONVENTION.
The Cape Cod Anti-Slavery Convention assembled in Exchange Hall, Harwich, on Saturday, Sept, 22d, at 2 o'clock, P. M. Capt. Gilbert Smith was chosen Chairman, and Francis Hinckly and Edwin Coombs Secretaries.
Mr. Charles C. Burleigh was the first speaker. He made one of his very ablest, most logical and splendid efforts, to show that our movement is founded  alone, and by the power of justice and truth must succeed.
The following persons were chosen a Business Committee:- C. C. Burleigh, E. H. Heywood, and Z. H. Small.
Financial Committee-J. H. Robbins, Alice Thacher, Nancy L. Howes, Nathaniel Robbins, and Watson B. Kelley.
Mr. Heywood, from the Business Committee, presented the following resolutions:-
1. Resolved, That since our first duty in relation to a sin against God, and a crime against man, is the immediate repentance and abandonment of it; and since the incidents of a social evil can be removed only by a removal of the evil itself; the issue of the American Anti-Slavery Society is still, as heretofore, not with the extension of slavery, the Dred Scott decision, the Fugitive Slave Bill, or the domestic or foreign slave trade, but with the natural and exhaustless source of all these abominations as established and sustained by State law, and in trenched within the Constitution, the slave system-of which it demands the immediate and unconditional abolition as the duty of the master, the right of the slave, and the only relief from those out crying evils which vex and convulse our nation, and whose continued existence is the utter subversion alike of liberty, 
2. Resolved, That the American Union, being a confederacy between slave and free States, in which the latter are implicated in all the guilt of slaveholding, and bound under oath to recapture the slaves if they escape, and crush them with the whole federal power if they revolt, every friend of impartial liberty should promptly repudiate it as a bold and impious conspiracy against justice and humanity, and raise the war-cry of the Abolitionists,' No union 'with slaveholders!'
3. Resolved, That while we regard the Republican party as the outgrowth of the anti-slavery movement, the spoils of this'thirty years' war' upon slavery-its treacherous and unholy alliance with slaveholders, slave-traders and slave-breeders, its advocacy and support of Abraham Lincoln for President, who endorses all the pro-slavery compromises of the Constitution as expounded by Clay and Webster, and the infamous black laws of his own State; and its cruel and remorseless pledge to allow and compel four million slaves to perish in their chains, make it necessarily and inevitably the foe of impartial freedom, and require that it should be shunned by every Northern voter who would save his own soul from blood-guiltiness, or lift the yoke of oppression from the bondmen of the South.
4. Resolved, That the continuance of slave-hunting upon the soil of Massachusetts should be as revolting to the moral sense of the people as it is disgraceful to the high religious character and matchless heroism of our ancestry, and is recreant to every sentiment of justice, humanity and freedom; and we pledge our untiring exertion to secure a law for its immediate and eternal prohibition.
5. Resolved, That if the Church of Christ is the pillar and ground of truth, the light of the world, and the salt of the earth, then the great mass of the religious organizations of this country, claiming to be Christian churches, are unworthy of the name, much as they give, some directly and some indirectly, efficient support to that system of falsehood, darknesss and corruption, American Slavery.
Met in the evening, at 7 o'clock.
C. L. Remond and E. H. Hey wood occupied the time in the evening, holding the audience by thrilling speeches to a late hour.
Adjourned to meet at 10 o'clock on Sunday morning.

SUNDAY MORNING. On the assembling of the Convention, Ezekiel chosen Chairman.
The resolutions were read again, and a lively discussion at once sprung up on the phraseology of the 4th of the series, participated in by C. L. Remond, C. C. Burleigh,- Doane and E.  discussion was animated and interesting.
Mr. Heywood then made a speech upon the Disunion doctrine, which was keen, lucid, eloquent, and very  to the audience.
At the close of Mr. Heywood's speech, the question of finance came up, and was briefly but pertinently spoken to by C. L. Remond, while the Committee circulated through the hall, and took the freewill offerings of the people, which amounted to $56.71.
Adjourned to 2 o'clock, P. M. 
The afternoon meeting was opened by a song from the friends of the slave, as were the previous sessions 
Mr. Burleigh then brought forward the fifth resolution of the series, and proceeded to make a powerful speech upon the fourth, demonstrating beyond a peradventure the importance of the resolution, and the duty of us all to work for the proposed law-ending with a most thrilling appeal against the terrible plague of Southern slavery.
The Convention during the day was crowded to overflowing.
In the evening, a large and attentive audience assembled, and listened through another long session to addresses from Mr. Remond, Mr. Heywood, Mrs. Bertha Chase, and Sylvanus Jagger.
After inserting in the fourth resolution the words should be,' for' is,' at the suggestion of Mr. Heywood, to meet the objection raised by Mr. Remond in the morning, the whole series were unanimously adopted.
The Convention was a decided success and fully up to the many previous ones which have made old Barnstable the Banner County of the Adjourned sine die.
EZEKIEL THACHER, Chairman. FRANCIS HINCKLEY, Secretary.

THE POLITICAL ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION AT WORCESTER 
WORCESTER, Sept. 22,1860.
 MR. GARRISON: The long and earnest effort of  friend S. S. Foster to organize a new political party on an anti-slavery basis culminated in a  in this city on Wednesday and Thursday of this week; which has come and gone, and the Foster party is organized, and will probably be in the field with its candidates for the various political offices, when it can discover in its ranks a sufficient number of men, or women, to nominate therefore.
Mr. Foster's movement and this Convention have proved something of a success, in the fact that a Convention was held, a platform adopted, and something slight 
But it has proved much more successful in demonstrating the wisdom and discriminating judgment of the members and friends of the American Anti-Slavery Society, in their non-acceptance of Mr. Foster's oft proffered resolutions affirming that' the time has fully come for the organization' of such a party, or that' the exigencies of our cause imperiously  such an organization, or that' a wise fidelity to the cause of the slave' makes it our duty to initiate such a party. These resolutions Mr. Foster has urged us to adopt, affirming that the day of talk was past- we want acts now; the people were converted, and only waited an opportunity to march in crowds to the organization of a party of action.
The Convention was held, and failed to attract the attention of large numbers of the converted and anxious people, or to show any great array of able or prominent men or women on its side. Mr. Pierpont, the President of a previous Convention, and whose name is appended to the call for this one, was not here; he was detained by business. Mr. Stephenson, Mr. Foster's right hand man and strong reliance, being detained by business, sent a letter, recommending the support of the Republican candidate for Governor, Mr. Andrew.
Of the eight advertised speakers, four only appeared; one of whom,-Frederick Douglass,-took Mr. Foster's view of the Constitution, and seemed to work very well with him, save that Mr. Douglass is a fighter and a voter, and Mr. Foster is neither. Another,-Mr. Higginson,-was in the Convention a short time, and said that he thought the argument for a pro-slavery construction of the Constitution was quite weak, and the argument for the anti-slavery construction nearly as weak; and, on the whole, he was glad of the excellence of the Republican nominations for President and Governor, and intended, for himself, to go for them. A third, -Dr. Cutter,- did not see in to believe the anti-slavery construction of the Constitution at all, but avowed his readiness to go for a party which should say that the Constitution was anti-slavery, and that they would have it so, any way, or for a party that should propose to amend the Constitution so  make it anti-slavery, or for a party that would take both positions! The fourth,- Lucy Stone,flatly repudiated the entire propositions of Mr. Foster, and, in a brief speech, gave her reasons for so doing.
Some others spoke, as Dr. Mann, J. T. Hutching, and T. Locke, in general sympathy with the movement; but the main talking was done by Mr. Foster and Mr. Douglass, who were the orators of the occasion. E. D. Draper of  and Joseph A. Rowland of this city, made brief criticisms upon the positions and avowals of the exponent speakers of the movement.
 The masses were very feebly represented, the attendance during the day sessions ranging from thirty to eighty in number, and in the evening numbering at most some two to three hundred. Few of these were from out; of town, and but a limited number appearing to sympathize fully with the movement; only some  certainly not more than twelve, appearing to vote on the adoption of the platform and resolutions. On account of the small number of friends present, no permanent organization of the meeting was made; but it existed comfortably with the aid of various temporary chairmen, sometimes with none at all, and with secretaries pro tem.
It made no nominations; but, on motion of Mr. Douglass, some half a dozen voted to ratify the Syracuse nominations of Smith and McFarland for the Presidency and Vice Presidency, and yet neglected to ratify Mr. Andrew's nomination for Governor of Massachusetts, in concurrence with Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Higginson.
 Resolutions were adopted, and a committee of correspondence chosen, looking to the formation of a'National Political Education Society,' for the purpose of preparing the people to join this' Union Democratic party.' By which, it would seem that there is not that entire preparation of the masses to rush into this organization that Mr. Foster has heretofore represented.
A large part of the business of this new party.- if indeed it will not be its first duty,-would appear, from the speeches of Mr. Foster, to be the abolition of the American Anti-Slavery Society, which he represented to be strangely but squarely in his way, and by its formidable opposition had hindered the movement heretofore, and kept the abolitionists away from the Convention. The manner of this opposition he described, on being questioned, to consist of the Society's unwillingness to discuss the questions with him at their meetings, the omission of the Standard and Liberator to publish the list of expected attractive speakers, and their further omission to speak a favorable word in behalf of the Convention-Mr. Garrison characterizing it as a farce in the Liberator, and Mr. Phillips calling it, at its spring meeting in Boston, a nuisance and farce that would tend to the demoralization of the public mind.
The unwillingness to discuss with him he seemed to take as a matter of considerable grief, especially as he had affirmed that he had an entirely new view of the question to argue in its behalf. But when it is recollected that Mr. Foster himself, during most of the time of the last few years of his connection with the American Society, declined to discuss this point, and when he did discuss it, used precisely the same arguments which would now be needed to meet his present position, and used them with unexampled potency, and to his own and others' conviction with entire success, and when it appears that his now' new' and original proposition consists of the affirmation that the courts have no right or power to construe the Constitution, which is so directly contrary to the letter of the Constitution which he now insists on upholding, that a mere statement of the position is its own entire refutation; the wisdom of this course of the friends of the Society is clearly apparent. The omission of the papers to publish his proffered list of names he admitted might have been in consequence of their non-reception of them, as he confessed he did not mail them till the last mail before their going to press, and a little delay of the post would explain the whole, which it was suggested to him was the more charitable conclusion, as both papers had unhesitatingly published his call in full, and kept its notice standing in the columns from the first.
But although he complained often of this omission, as affecting the numbers of the Convention, yet it would seem to have been a very providential occurrence; for had the people been attracted, by his advertised list of speakers, to the Convention, expecting they were all to support Mr. Foster's new party, they would have been sadly disappointed, if they had not felt imposed on, by finding only half the list of speakers present, and only one of there in sympathy with the movement.
Mr.  attempted to prove the charge of Mr. Garrison having called this meeting a farce, by asserting that the Liberator had called the meeting of the Gerrit Smith party, at Syracuse, a farce, and as this meeting was in sympathy with that, and auxiliary to it, the characterization applied to this, But
<c04>
when, by referring to the Liberator, it was found that Mr. Garrison had only characterized the action of the Syracuse Convention in nominating candidates for the Presidency, etc., in view of the smallness of its numbers, as extremely farcical; and when it was suggested that it had not appeared in any announcement or action of the movement previous to this statement that this was connected, by auxiliaryship or otherwise, with the  Smith movement, the charge seemed to be nothing more than a quibble.
Mr. Douglass seemed to come quite readily into the work of the annihilation of the American A.;S. Society, and in his various speeches took frequent occasion to misrepresent its character, and with his inimitable powers of sarcasm to caricature its positions and measures. At one time, in urging the support of this new movement, he said that it was the only organization that proposed the abolition of  suggested the incorrectness of this assertion. In reply, Mr. Douglass said, I know that our friend thinks that the object of the American Anti-Slavery Society is the abolition of slavery, but he is mistaken, for the object of that Society is the dissolution of the American Union. To be sure, they hold that the abolition of slavery will follow the dissolution of the Union, but that is a matter of opinion. In my opinion it would not 
When Mr. Douglass was through, Mr. Howland took the floor, and without attempting to make a full constitutional argument, confined himself to a brief review of some of the sophistries and falsifications of history whereon Mr. Douglass had based his constitutional argument, and took occasion to say, in sustaining the position and, character of the American Anti-Slavery Society, that when Mr. Douglass asserted that the abolition of slavery was not the object or purpose of that Society, he made a false assertion, and one that he knew to be false. Whereupon Mr. Foster called to order. The temporary Chairman told Mr. Howland that his remark was neither parliamentary nor pretty, and Mr. Douglass thought that he ought to take it back. But as Mr. Douglass showed no disposition to retract his audacious libel, Mr. Howland did not retract his characterization of it. Had Mr. Douglass simply said that, in his opinion, the position or action of the American Anti-Slavery Society could not result in the abolition of slavery, or even explained that this was what he meant in what he did say, it would have clearly appeared to be his right to hold and express this opinion, and Mr. Howland's remark would have been out of place as well as out of taste. But he did no such thing. And it is to be hoped that whenever he utters so atrocious a slander, some one will have the manliness to rebuke him with as plain Anglo-Saxon speech as Mr. How-land did on this occasion.
Mr. Foster's self-sacrificing devotion, his transparent sincerity and his untiring zeal are not at all matters of ridicule or of light esteem. Still, the enthusiasm of his earnestness sometimes leads him to make very strange assertions and to take very ridiculous positions; and when the mountain labors, and brings forth only a mouse, it is still a farce, however honest and sincere the mountain may be. So is this movement, as a political movement, which has no power but that of numbers; the few numbers which it attracts make it really a farce in its results. But it is otherwise in moral movements, for there one shall chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight.
This new project of Mr. Foster, in so far as it tends to furnish those who propose to continue active under a pro-slavery government with the shield of an avowed belief in an anti-slavery construction of the Constitution for an excuse, and in so far as it shall be a success that will tend to divide abolitionists where union is the great desideratum, and in so far as it shall tend to complicate and confuse anti-slavery measures and action, can prove to be nothing but a nuisance.
If Mr. Foster shall succeed to any extent in prevailing upon the masses to ignore the facts of history, to withstand their own reason and common sense, by calling the United States Constitution an anti-slavery instrument, and promising and swearing a faith to that, Constitution that they do not intend to keep, in so much will he demoralize and debauch the public conscience.

MEETINGS AT THE CAPE. We are extremely gratified to learn that the annual gathering of the friends of freedom at Harwich, on Saturday and Sunday last, was eminently successful both in reference to the numbers that attended, and the high-toned anti-slavery spirit that prevailed. If our absence caused any disappointment, let them all be assured that our regret, on being obliged to remain at home in consequence of illness and loss of voice, was very great; for no part of the Commonwealth do we ever visit with more pleasure than the Cape.

FUGITIVE SLAVE EXCITEMENT IN OHIO-SLAVE OFFICERS AND THE  Thursday last the U. S. Marshal, with two Deputies and eight or ten men, went to Iberia, Morgan county. In this State, to arrest three slaves, who ran away from Germantown, Ky., about four months since. One was captured by the Marshal, and after an examination by the Commissioner, was remanded to the custody of his former master 
 One of the Deputies in attempting to capture another negro was set upon by the crowd, who tore off his clothing and took away his warrant and money, and threatened to hang or shoot him, but after cropping his hair, they allowed him to depart without the negro. The other Deputy was fired upon while attempting to arrest a third negro, and returning the fire shot the fingers off the hand of one of the rioters, but was obliged to leave without the negro.

' Friend of humanity, wait not, O, wait not, I beseech you, until the opened heavens shall flood the land with rains that shall add sickness to poverty. For then what shall these poor people do? Delay not your work of mercy until drifting snows and driving sleet shall intensify suffering already too great to be borne. For the love of God, I pray you postpone not your philanthropy an hour. Believe me, there is no time to spare, Let not the wailing winds of March be the requiem of the dead who shall  perished for want of your timely aid.'

PORTRAIT OF GEORGE THOMPSON, ESQ.
The owner of incomparably the best portrait of GEORGE THOMPSON, Esq., (the eloquent British orator and champion of universal  extant in the United States, it being a highly finished Talbotype, taken in Philadelphia when he was last in this country, is desirous of finding for it an appreciative purchaser, in consequence of being reduced in his circumstances. It can be seen at the Anti-Slavery Office, 221 Washington Street, and the price ascertained on application to Mr. Wallcut. The possession of such a portrait should be a matter of emulation among the numerous friends and admirers of Mr. Thompson, whose services in the abolition of West India slavery, in behalf of the oppressed natives in India, in the repeal of the Corn Laws, in curtailing the despotic power of the British East India Company, in the extension of British suffrage, in the promotion of the cause of peace and other beneficent movements, and in co-operation with the friends of freedom here for the overthrow of American slavery, entitle him to stand high on the list of the benefactors of mankind.
 We endorse the accuracy of this likeness of Mr. Thompson as the best finished and the most satisfactory that we have yet seen of him. The Talbotype process makes it very enduring, though necessarily adding somewhat to its expense.-Ed. Lib.

STATE CONVENTION.
The Fourth Annual Meeting of the Vermont Anti-Slavery Convention will be held at BRADFORD, on Wednesday and Thursday, the 17th and 13th of October next.
The enslavement of four millions in our land, the indescribable wrongs done to the oppressed, the continued refusal of political parties and of many religious sects to demand the abolition of slavery, the increase of the slave trade, the strength and daring attempts of the Slave Power in the Federal Government, and the new reign of terror in the South, as well as the persecuting spirit manifested in the North, all call for a large and enthusiastic assemblage of the friends of freedom without distinction.
Seeking the emancipation of the enslaved, and the highest good of our common country, let the earnest friends of human rights, in obedience to the voice of God, of humanity and of patriotism, come together for a full and free discussion of the great questions now before the people.

Is there any virtue in
MRS. S. A.ALLENSS
WORLDS
HAIR RESTORER ?
 
READ THE FOLLOWING, AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.
TO THE ED'S My age is sixty. One year ago, my hair was very gray, and had been gradually falling, until, on the crown, it had become quite thin. About the 1st of March, of the present year, I commenced using Mrs. S. A. Allen's' Restorer,' No. 1, according to the directions, and  continued to apply a alight dressing of the same once in three or four weeks, on retiring to bed. My hair is now almost restored to its original color, and the hue appears to be permanent. I AM SATISFIED THAT THE PREPARATION IS NOTHING LIKE A  BUT OPERATES UPON THE SECRETIONS. My hair ceases to , which is certainly an advantage to one who was in danger of becoming bald.

Bridgewater, Oneida Co., N. Y., Nov.22,1855  
President J. L. EATON. I.L. D., Union University,
Murfreesboro', Tennessee.
' MADAM-I would state, that  time last spring I found MY HAIR FALLING OFF. I concluded to purchase a bottle of'Mrs. S. A. Allen1s World's Restorer,s &c., and give it a trial. I commenced using it. but very irregularly; but notwithstanding this irregularity, I found that its indene was distinctly visible, THE FALLING OFF OF HAIR CEASED, and my locks, which before were quite GRAY, WERE CHANGED TO BLACK. I do not consider that I have given it a fair trial, but, from what I have seen of its effects in my own case, I have reason to believe that it is capable of accomplishing what it purports to  PREVENT THE HAIR  FALLING OFF, and to RESTORE GRAY LOCKS TO THEIR COLOR
 Mrs. D. W. CLARK, wife of Rev. D. W. CLARK, Editor' Ladies' Repository,' incinnati, Ohio.
'I have been using Mrs.  A. Allen's Zylobalsamum with much satisfaction in dressing my own and children's hair. After trying various articles manufactured for the hair, I feel no hesitation in recommending yours as the but I have ever used. It gives the hair a soft, glossy appearance, and retains it in any position desired.'

'Your Hair Restorer and Zylobalsamum is the best I have ever known. It has restored my hair to its natural color &c 
 Rev. E. R.FAIRCHILD. D. D., Cor. Sec. American and Foreign Christian Union, N. Y. City.
'Mrs. S. A. Allen's Hair Restorer and Zylobulsamum have been used in my family with beneficial effects; and I take pleaure in recommending them to such as have occasion to use such preparations.'
Rev. A. WEBSTER, Editor' Christian Era,' Boston,Macs,
'Having used numerous specifics to little purpose, I discarded all, believing them to be of no value. So I regarded your World's Hair Restorer and Zylobalsamum, yet personal friends prevailed on me to use it. I have done so for several months past with good effect and entire satisfaction. I am  neither bald nor gray; my hair was dry and brittle, but has regained the softness of my earlier years.'

Mrs. S. A. Allen's World's Hair Restorer, found among our other advertisements, we insert from actual experiment. That it promotes the growth of the hair where baldness had commenced, we have now the evidence of our own eyes. We can testify to its good Rev. S. B. MORLEY, Pastor Congregational Church, Attleboro', 
'I have used Mrs. S. A. Allen's Word's Hair Restorer and Zylobalsamum. The effect of the Hair Restorer has been to change the' crown of glory' which belongs to old men to the original hue of youth. This was done by a single bottle used according to directions. Others of my acquaintance have used it with the same effect. The Zylobalsamum I regard as an invaluable dressing for the hair.'
Rev. DANIEL T. WOOD, Middletown, Orange Co., N. Y.
' My hair has greatly thickened upon my head, and put on a very lively, healthy appearance. The same is true of my daughter; HER HAIR HAD BECOME THIN, AND CAME OUT CONSTANTLY, UNTIL WE THOUGHT THE HEAD WOULD BE ALMOST BARE; HER HAIR HAS HANDSOMELY THICKENED UP, AND ALSO HAS A HEALTHY APPEARANCE. We are thankful to you, and feel that we have full value of our money.'
GREAT BRITAIN.
Rev. W. B. THORNELOE, Prescot, Lancashire, England.
' Your Hair Restorer is a perfect marvel. After having used it for six weeks, my extremely gray hair was restored to its natural color,-not the wig-like appearance produced by dyes, but to its own natural color, which satisfies my mind that it is not a dye. I can strongly recommend it, and shall feel happy in answering the queries of any you may refer to me.'

THE CHILDREN'S HOUR
BY HENRY W.LONGFELLOW.
Between the dark and the daylight,
When the night is beginning to lower
Comes a pause in the day's occupation,
That is known as the Childrens Hour
I hear in the chamber above me
The patter of little feet,
The sound of a door that is opened,
And voices soft and sweet.
From my study I see in the lamplight,
Descending the broad hall stair,
Grave Alice, and laughing Allegra,
And Edith with golden hair
A whisper, and then a silence:
Yet I know by their merry eyes
They are plotting and planning together
To take me by surprise
A sudden rush from the stairway,
A sudden raid from the hall!
By three doors left unguarded,
They enter my castle wall
They climb up into my turret,
Oer the arms and bark of my chair;
If I try to escape, they surround me;
They seem to be everywhere.
They almost devour me with kisses,
Their arms about me entwine,
Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen
In his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine!
Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti,
Because you have scaled the wall,
Such an old moustache as I am,
Is not a match for you all?
I have you fast in my fortress,
And will not let you depart,
But put you down into the dungeons
In the round-tower of my heart
And they will I keep you forever,
Yes, forever and a day,
Till the walls shall crumble to ruin,
And moulder <illegible> away

SONG OF FREEDOM.
Patriot, on, where duty leads!
Onward, for thy country bleeds!
Dare for her in noble deeds,-
Be not faithless now:
Hearts of true men beat for thee,
Thousands bend the prayerful knee,
Wait to shout when victory
Crowns thine ample brow.
'Freedom! be your battle-cry-
Let it flash from every eye
Lift your glorious banner high,
In the strength of God:
He who ope'd the roaring sea,
That his chosen ones might flee,
Will your mighty helper be:
Humbly take his rod.
Many hopes may sink and rise,
Many clouds o'erspread the skies,
Faithful hearts grow faint with sighs,
Ere the happy morn;
But a star bespeaks it near
See Oppression's coward fear!
Soon the bondman's joyful tear
Shall usher in the dawn!
For a day though tempests lower,
Virtue bleed, and vice devour,
Tyrants triumph for an hour,
Yet an end shall come;
Ruffians bruise the honored head,
Strew the plains with noble dead;
God will watch the martyr's bed
Till that day of doom!

TRUE MANHOOD.
I love the man whose honest heart
Will bravely bear and bravely do,
Who neer will act a coward's part,
But, strong in right, will right pursue
Whose knee, ne'er bending at the nod
Of titled pomp, or regal power,
But bows alone before his God,
With hope his crown, and love his bower:
Who dares to face a world of scorn,
And dares a brother's hand to span,
Though dark the skin and rough the form,
If yet that brother be a man:
Who strikes wherever wrong is found,
And brands a tyrant to his face;
Nor courts applausean empty sound
But firmly treads in virtues trace
Such are the men whove stemmed the tide,
And clove their way through giant wrong;
Whove fought triumphant, side by side,
Through perils deep and trials long:
Whose martyred forms are thickly strewn
On many ancient fields of crime;
But seeds of truth theyve widely sown,
To blossom rich in coming time
Amid that army of the dead
Whose legions pale and silent lie,
They have a passing fragrance shed
Their names, immortal, neer shall die

Seize your arms and count your numbers!
Nows the time for deeds of bravery!
Freedom grapples now with Slavery!

THE LIBERATOR
From the Atlantic Monthly for October
THEODORE PARKER
Sir Launcelot! ther thou lyest; thou were never matched of none earthly knights hands; thou were the truest freende to thy lover that ever bestrood horse; and thou were the kindest man that ever strooke with sword; and thou were the sternest knight to thy mortal foe that ever put spere in the rest.'-La Morte D Arthur.
In the year 1828, there was a young man of eighteen at work upon a farm at Lexington, performing bodily labor to the extent of twenty hours in a day, sometimes, and that for several days together, and at other times studying intensely when work was less pressing. Thirty years after, that same man sat in the richest private library in Boston, working habitually from twelve to seventeen hours a day in severer toil. The interval was crowded with labors, with acquisitions, with reproaches, with victories, with honors; and he who experienced all this died exhausted at the end of it, less than fifty years old, but looking seventy. That man was Theodore Parker.
The time is far distant when, out of a hundred different statements of contemporaries, some calm biographer will extract sufficient materials for a true picture of the man; and, meanwhile, all that each can do is to give fearlessly his own honest impressions, and so tempt others to give theirs. Of the multitude of different photographers, each perchance may catch some one trait, without which the whole portraiture would have remained incomplete; and the time to secure this is now, while his features are fresh in our minds. It is a daring effort, but it needs to be made.
Yet Theodore Parker was so strong and self-sufficing upon his own ground, he needed so little from any other, while giving so freely to all, that one would hardly venture to add anything to the autobiographies he has left, but for the high example he set of fearlessness in dealing with the dead. There may be some whose fame is so ill-established, that one shrinks from speaking of them precisely as one saw them; but this mans place is secure, and that friend best praises him who paints him just as he seemed. To depict him as he was must be the work of many men, and no single observer, however intimate, need attempt it The first thing that strikes an observer, in listening to the words of public and private feeling elicited by his departure, is the predominance in them all of the sentiment of love. His services, his speculations, his contests, his copious eloquence, his many languages, these come in as secondary things, but the predominant testimony is emotional. Men mourn the friend even more than the warrior. No fragile and lovely girl, fading untimely into heaven, was ever more passionately beloved than this white-haired and world-weary man. As he sat in his library, during his lifetime, he was not only the awakener of a thousand intellects, but the centre of a thousand hearts; he furnished the natural home for every foreign refugee, every hunted slave, every stray thinker, every vexed and sorrowing woman. And never, was there one of these who went away uncomforted, and from every part of this bread nation their scattered hands now fling roses upon his grave.
This immense debt of gratitude was not bought by any mere isolated acts of virtue; indeed, it never is so bought; love never is won but by a nobleness which pervades the life. In the midst of his greatest cares, there never was a moment when he was not all too generous of his time, his wisdom, and his money. Borne down by the accumulation of labors, grudging, as a student grudges, the precious hour that, once lost, can never be won back, he yet was always holding himself at the call of some poor criminal at the police office, or some sick girl in a suburban town, not of his recognized parish, perhaps, but longing for the ministry of the only preacher who had touched her soul. Not a mere wholesale reformer, he wore out his life by retailing its great influences to the poorest comer. Not generous in money only,-though the readiness of his beneficence in that direction had few equals,-he always hastened past that minor bestowal to ask if there were not some other added gift possible, some personal service or correspondence, some life-blood, in short, to be lavished in some other form, to eke out the already liberal donation of dollars.
There is an impression that he was unforgiving he certainly was; for he had no power: of forgetfulness, whether for good or evil. He had none of that convenient oblivion which in softer natures covers sin and saintliness with one common careless pall. So long as a man persisted in a wrong attitude before God or man, there was no day so laborious or exhausting, no night so long or drowsy, but Theodore Parkers unsleeping memory stood on guard, full-armed, ready to do battle at a moment's warning. This is generally known; but what may not be known so widely is, that, the moment the adversary lowered his spear, were it for only an inch or an instant, that moment Theodore Parkers weapons were down, and his arms open. Make but the slightest concession, give him but the least excuse to love you, and never was there seen such promptness in forgiving. His friends found it sometimes harder to justify his mildness, than his severity. I confess that I, with others, have often felt inclined to criticise a certain caustic tone of his, in private talk, when the name of an offender was alluded to; but I have also felt almost indignant at his lenient good-nature to that very person, let him once show the smallest symptom of contrition, or seek, even in the clumsiest way, or for the most selfish purpose, to disarm his generous antagonist. His forgiveness in such cases was more exuberant than his wrath had ever been.
It is inevitable, in describing him, to characterize his life first by its quantity. He belonged to the true race of the giants of learning; he took in knowldge at every pore, and his desires were insatiable. Not, perhaps, precocious in boyhood,-for it is not precocity to begin Latin at ten and Greek at eleven,to enter the Freshman class at twenty, and the professional school at twenty-three,-he was equalled by new students in the tremendous rate at which he pursued every study, when once begun. With strong body and great constitutional industry, always accuiring and never forgetting, he was doubtless, at the time of his death, the most variously learned of living Americans, as well as one of the most prolific of stators and writers.
Why did Theodore Parker die? He died prematurely, worn out through this enormous activity,-a warning as well as an example. To all appeals for modeation, during the latter years of his life, he had but line answer,that he had six generations of longlived farmers behind him, and had their strength to draw upon. All his physical habits, except in this respect, were unexceptionable: he was abstemious in <illegible> tied, but not ascetic, kept no unwholesome hours, tried no dangerous experiments, committed no excesses. expenses.But there is no man who can habitually study from twelve to seventeen hours a day, (his friend Mr. Clarke contracts it to from six to twelve, but I have Mr. Parkers own statement of the fact,) without ultimate self-destruction. Nor was this the practice during his period of health alone, but it was pushed to the last moment: he continued in the pulpit long after a withdrawal was peremptorily 
prescribed for him; and when forbidden to leave come for lecturing, during the winter of 1858, he <illegible> straight way prepared the most laborious literary works of his life, for delivery as lectures is in the Fraternity Course at Boston.
He worked thus, not from ambition, nor altogether from principle, but from an immense craving for <illegible> labor, which had become second nature to him. His great omniverous, hungry intellect must have constant food, new languages, new statistics, new <illegible> historical investigations, new scientific discoveries,
<c03>
new systems of Scriptural exegesis. He did not, for a day in the year, nor an hour in the day, make rest a matter of principle, nor did he ever indulge in it as a pleasure, for he knew no enjoyment so to great as labor. Wordsworths wise passiveness was utterly foreign to his nature. Had he been a mere student, this had been less destructive. But to take the standard of study of a German Professor, and superadd to that the separate exhaustions of a Sunday-preacher, a lyceum-lecturer, a radical leader, and a practical philanthropist, was simply to apply half a dozen distinct suicides to the abbreviation of a single life. And, as his younger companions long since assured him, the tendency of his career was not only to kill himself, but them; for each assumed that he must at least attempt what Theodore Parker accomplished.
It is very certain that his career was much shortened by these enormous labors, and it is not certain that its value was increased in a sufficient ratio to compensate for that evil. He justified his incessant winter-lecturing by the fact that the whole country was his parish, though this was not an adequate excuse. But what right had he to deprive himself even of the accustomed summer respite of ordinary preachers, and waste the golden July hours in studying Sclavonic dialects? No doubt his work in the world was greatly aided both by the fact and the fame of learning, and, as he himself somewhat disdainfully said, the knowledge of Greek and Hebrew was a convenience in theological discussions; but, after all, his popular power did not mainly depend on his mastery of twenty languages, but of one. Theodore Parkers learning was undoubtedly a valuable possession to the community, but it was not worth tie the price of Theodore Parkers life.
Strive constantly to concentrate yourself, said the laborious Goethe; never dissipate your powers; incessant activity, of whatever kind, leads finally to bankruptcy. But Theodore Parkers whole endeavor was to multiply his channels, and he exhausted his life in the effort to do all mens work. He was a hard man to relieve, to help, or to co-operate with. Thus the Massachusetts Quarterly Review began with quite a promising corps of contributors; but when it appeared that its editor, if left alone, would willingly undertake all the articles-science, history, literature everything,-of course the others yielded to inertia, and dropped away. So, some years later, when some of us met at his room to consult on a cheap series of popular theological works, he himself was so rich in his own private plans, that all the rest were impoverished; nothing could be named but he had been planning just that for years, and should by-and-by get leisure for it, and there really was not enough left to call out the energies of any one else. Not from any petty egotism, but simply from inordinate activity, he stood ready to take all the parts.
In the same way he distanced everybody; every companion-scholar found boon that it was impossible to keep pace with one who was always accumulating, and losing nothing. Most students find it necessary to be constantly forgetting some things to make room for later arrivals; but the peculiarity of his memory was that he let nothing go. I have more than once heard him give a minute analysis of the contents of some dull book read twenty years before, and have afterwards found the statement correct and exhaustive His great library,-the only private library I have ever seen which reminded one of the Astor,-although latterly collected more for public than personal uses, was one which no other man in the nation, probably, had sufficient bibliographical knowledge single-handed to select, and we have very few men capable of fully appreciating its scholarly value, as it stands. It seems as if its possessor, putting all his practical and popular side into his eloquence and action, had indemnified himself by investing all his scholarship in a library of which less than a quarter of the books were in the English language 
All unusual learning, however, brings with it the suspicion of superficiality; and in this country, where, as Mr. Parker himself said, every one gets a mouthful of education, but scarce one a full meal,-where every one who makes a Latin quotation is styled a ripe scholar, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the true from the counterfeit. It is, however, possible to apply some tests. I remember, for instance, that one of the few undoubted classical scholars, in the old-fashioned sense, whom New England has seen,the late 
John Glen King of Salem,-while speaking with very limited respect of the acquirements of Rufus Choate in this direction, and with utter contempt of those of Daniel Webster, always became enthusiastic on coming to Theodore Parker. He is the only man, said Mr. King more than once to the writer, with whom I can sit down, and seriously discuss a disputed reading, and find him familiar with all that has been written upon it. Yet Greek and Latin were only the preliminaries of Mr. Parkers scholarship.
I know, for one-and there are many who will bear the same testimony-that I never went to Mr. Parker to talk over a subject which I had just made a speciality, without finding that on that particular matter he happened to know, without any special investigation, more than I did. This extended beyond books, sometimes stretching into things where his questioners opportunities for knowledge had seemed considerably greater-as, for instance, in points connected with the habits of our native animals and the phenomena of out-door Nature. Such were his wonderful quickness and his infallible memory, that glimpses of these things did for him the work of years. But, of course, it was in the world of books that this wonderful superiority was chiefly seen, and the following example may serve as one of the most striking among many:-
It happened to me, some years since, in the course of some historical inquiries, to wish for fuller information in regard to the barbarous feudal codes of the Middle Ages,-as the Salic, Burgundian, and Ripuarian,-before the time of Charlemagne. The common historians, even Hallam, gave no very satisfactory information, and referred to no very available books; and supposing it to be a matter of which every well-read lawyer would at least know something, I asked help of the most scholarly member of that profession within my reach. He regretted his inability to give me any aid, but referred me to a friend of his, who was soon to visit him, a young man, who was already eminent for legal learning. The friend soon arrived, but owned, with some regret, that he had paid no attention to that particular subject, and did not even know what books to refer to; but he would at least ascertain what they were, and let me know, (N.B.I have never heard from him since.) Stimulated by ill-success, I aimed higher, and struck at the Supreme Bench of a certain State, breaking in on the mighty repose of his Honor with the name of Charlemagne? responded my is lord judge, rubbing his burleigh brow Charlemagne lived, I think, in the sixth century?' Dismayed, I retreated, with little further inquiry; and sure of one man, at least, to whom law meant also history and literature, I took refuge with Charles Sumner. That accomplished scholar, himself for once at fault, could only frankly advise me to do at last what I ought to have done at first,-to apply to Theodore Parker. I did so. Go, replied he instantly, to alcove twenty-four, shelf one hundred and thirteen, of the College Library at Cambridge, and you will find the information you seed in a thick quarto, bound in vellum, and lettered Potgiesser de Statu Servorum. I straightway went for Potgiesser, and found my fortune made. It was one of those patient old German treatises which cost the labor of one mans life to compile, and anothers to exhaust; and I had no reason to suppose that any reader had disturbed its repose until that unwearied industry had to explored the library.
Amid such multiplicity of details, he must some-times hare made mistakes, and with his great quickness of apprehension he sometimes formed hasty con
<c04>
clusions. But no one has any right to say that his great acquirements were bought by any habitual sacrifice of thoroughness. To say that they sometimes of impaired the quality of his thought would, undoubtedly, be more just; and this is a serious charge to bring. Learning is not accumulation, but assimilation; every mans real acquirements must pass into his its own organization, and undue or hasty nutrition does no good. The most priceless knowledge is not worth the smallest impairing of the quality of the thinking. The scholar cannot afford, any more than the farmer, to lavish his strength in clearing more land than the can cultivate; and Theodore Parker was compelled, by the natural limits of time and strength, to let vast tracts lie fallow, and to miss something of the natural resources of the soil. One sometimes wishes that he had studied less, and dreamed more-for less encyclopedic information, and more of his own rich brain.
But it was in popularizing thought and knowledge that his great and wonderful power lay. Not an original thinker, in the same sense with Emerson, he yet translated for tens of thousands that which Emerson spoke to hundreds only. No matter who had been heard on any subject, the great mass of intelligent, progressive New England thinkers waited to hear the thing summed up by Theodore Parker. This popular interest went far beyond the circle of his avowed sympathizers; he might be a heretic, but nobody could deny that he was a marksman. No matter how well others seemed to have hit the target, his shot was the triumphant one, at last Thinkers might find no new thought in the new discourse, leaders of action no new plan, yet, after all that had been said and done, his was the statement that told upon the community. He knew this power of his, and had analyzed some of the methods by which he attained it, though, after all, the best part was an unconscious and magnetic faculty. But he early learned, so he once told me, that the New England people dearly loved two things, a philosophical arrangement and a plenty of statistics. To these, therefore, he treated them thoroughly; in some of his Ten Sermons,' the demand made upon the systematizing power of his audience was really formidable; and I have always remembered a certain lecture of his on the Anglo-Saxons as the most wonderful instance that ever came within my knowledge of the adaptation of solid learning to the popular intellect. Nearly two hours of almost unadorned fact, for there was far lees than usual of relief and illustration,-and yet the lyceum-audience listened to it as if an angel sang to them. So perfect was his sense of purpose and of power, so clear and lucid was his delivery, with such wonderful composure did he lay out, section by section, his historical chart, that he grasped his hearers as absolutely as he grasped his subject: one was compelled to believe that he might read the people the Sanscrit Lexicon, and they would listen with ever fresh delight. Without grace or beauty or melody, his mere elocution was sufficient to produce effects which melody and grace and beauty might have sighed for in vain. And I always felt that he well described his own eloquence while describing Luthers, in one of the most admirably moulded sentences he ever achieved,-The homely force of Luther, who, in the language of the farm, the shop, the boat, the street or the nursery, told the high truths that reason or religion taught, and took possession of his audience; by a storm of speech, then poured upon them all the riches of his brave plebeian soul, baptizing every head anew ,-a man who with the people seemed more mob than they, and with kings the most imperial man.'
Another key to his strong hold upon the popular mind was to be found in his thorough Americanism of training and sympathy. Surcharged with European learning, he yet remained at heart the Lexington farmers-boy, and his whole atmosphere was indigenous, not exotic. Not haunted by any of the distrust and over-criticism which are apt to effeminate the American scholar, he plunged deep into the current of hearty national life around him, loved it, trusted it, believed in it; and the combination of this vital faith with such tremendous criticism of public and, private sins formed an irresistible power. He could condemn without crushing,-denounce mankind, yet save it from despair. Thus his pulpit became one of the great forces of the nation, like the New York Tribune. His printed volumes had but a limited circulation, owing to a defective system of publication, which his friends tried in vain to correct; but the circulation of his pamphlet-discourses was very great; he issued them faster and faster, latterly often in pairs, and they instantly spread far and wide. Accordingly he found his listeners everywhere; he could not go so far West but his abundant fame had preceded him; his lecture-room in the remotest places was crowded, and his hotel-chamber also, until late at night. Probably there was no private man in the nation, except, perhaps, Beecher and Greeley, whom personal strangers were so eager to see; while from a transatlantic direction he was sought by visitors to whom the two other names were utterly unknown. Learned men from the continent of Europe always found their way, first or last, to Exeter Place; and it is said that Thackeray, on his voyage to this country, declared that the thing in America which he most desired was to hear Theodore Parker talk.
Indeed, his conversational power was so wonderful that no one could go away from a first interview without astonishment and delight. There are those among us, it may be, more brilliant in anecdote or repartee, more eloquent, more profoundly suggestive; but for the outpouring of vast floods of various and delightful information, I believe that he could have had no Anglo-Saxon rival, except Macaulay. And in Mr. Parkers case, at least, there was no alloy of conversational arrogance or impatience of opposition. He monopolized, not because he was ever unwilling to hear others, but because they did not care to hear themselves when he was by. The subject made no difference; he could talk on anything. I was once with him in the society of an intelligent Quaker farmer, when the conversation fell on agriculture: the farmer held his own ably for a time; but long after he was drained dry, our wonderful companion still flowed on exhaustions, with accounts of Nova Scotia ploughing and Tennessee hoeing, and all things rural, ancient and modern, good and bad, till it seemed as if the one amusing and interesting theme in the universe were the farm. But it soon proved that this was only one among his thousand departments, and his hearers, felt, as was said of old Fuller, as if he had served his time at every trade in town.
But it must now be owned that these astonishing results were bought by some intellectual sacrifices which his nearer friends do not all recognize, but which posterity will mourn. Such a rate of speed is incompatible with the finest literary execution. A delicate literary ear he might have had, perhaps, but he very seldom stopped to cultivate or even indulge it. This neglect was not produced by his frequent habit of extemporaneous speech alone; for it is a singular fact, that Wendell Phillips, who rarely writes a line, yet contrives to give to his hastiest efforts the air of elaborate preparation, while Theodore Parkers most scholarly performances were still stump-speeches. Vigorous, rich, brilliant, copious, they yet seldom afford a sentence which falls in perfect cadence upon the ear; under a show of regular method, they are loose and diffuse, and often have the qualities which he himself attributed to the style of John Quincy Adams,-disorderly, ill-compacted, and homely to a fault.' He said of Dr. Channing- Diffuseness is the old Adam of the pulpit. There are always two ways of hitting the mark,-one with a single bullet, the other with a shower of small shot: Dr. Channing chose the latter, as most of our pulpit orators have done.' Theodore Parker chose it also.
Perhaps Nature and necessity chose it for him. If not his temperament, at least the circumstances of his
<c05>
position, cut him off from all high literary finish. He created the congregation at the Music Hall, and that congregation, in turn, moulded his whole life. For that great stage, his eloquence became inevitably a kind of brilliant scene-painting,-large, fresh, profuse, rapid showy;-masses of light and shade, wonderful effects, but farewell forever to all finer touches and delicate gradations! No man can write for posterity, while hastily snatching a half-day from a week's lecturing, during which to prepare a telling Sunday harangue for three thousand people. In the perpetual rush and hurry of his life, he had no time to select, to discriminate, to omit anything, or to mature anything. He had the opportunities, the provocatives, and the drawbacks which make the work and mar the fame of the professional journalist. His intellectual existence, after he left the quiet of West Roxbury, was from hand to mouth. Needing above all men to concentrate himself, he was compelled by his whole position to lead a profuse and miscellaneous life.
All popular orators must necessarily repeat themselves, preachers chiefly among orators, and Theodore Parker chiefly among preachers. The mere frequency of production makes this inevitable,-a fact which always makes every finely organized intellect, first or last, grow weary of the pulpit. But in his case there were other compulsions. Every Sunday a quarter part of his vast congregation consisted of persons who had never, or scarcely ever, heard him before, and who might never hear him again. Not one of those visitors must go away, therefore, without hearing the great preacher define his position on every point,-not theology alone, but all current events and permanent principles, the Presidential nomination or message, the laws of trade, the laws of Congress, womans rights, womans costume, Boston slave-kidnappers, and Dr. Banbaby,-he must put it all in. His ample discourse must be like an Oriental poem, which, begins with the creation of the universe, and includes all subsequent farts incidentally. It is astonishing to look over his published sermons and addresses, and see under how many different names the same stirring speech has been reprinted;-new illustrations, new statistics, and all remoulded with such freshness that the hearer had no suspicions, nor the speaker either, and yet the same essential thing. Sunday discourse-, lyceum lecture, convention speech, it made no difference, he must cover all the points every time. No matter what theme might be announced, the people got the whole latitude and longitude of Theodore Parker, and that was precisely what they wanted, He, more than any other man among us, broke down the traditional non-committalism of the lecture-room, and oxygenated all the lyceums of the land. He thus multiplied his audience very greatly, while perhaps losing to some degree the power of close logic and of addressing a specific statement to a special point. Yet it seemed as if he could easily leave the lancet to others, grant him only the hammer and the forge.
Ah, but the long centuries, where the reading of books is concerned, set aside all considerations of quantity, of popularity, of immediate influence, and sternly test by quality alone, judge each author by his most golden sentence, and let all else go. The deeds make the man, but it is the style which makes or dooms the writer. History, which always sends great men in groups, gave us Emerson by whom to test the intellectual qualities of Parker. They cooperated in their work from the beginning, in much the same mutual relation as now; in looking back over the rich volumes of the 'Dial, the reader now passes by the contributions of Parker to glean every sentence of Emersons, but we have the latters authority for the fact that it was the formers articles which originally sold the numbers. Intellectually, the two men form the complement to each other; it is Parker who reaches the mass of the people, but it is probable that all his writings put together have not had so profound an influence on the intellectual leader of the nation as the single address of Emerson at Divinity Hall.
And it is difficult not to notice, in that essay in which Theodore Parker ventured on higher intellectual ground, perhaps, than anywhere else in his writings,-his critique on Emerson in the 'Massachusetts! Quarterly, the indications of this mental disparity, It is in many respects a noble essay, full of fine moral appreciations, bravely generous, admirable in the loyalty of spirit shown towards a superior mind, and all warm with a personal friendship which could find no superior. But so far as literary execution is concerned, the beautiful sentences of Emerson stand out like fragments of carved marble from the rough plaster in which they are imbedded. Nor this alone; but, on drawing near the vestibule of the authors finest thoughts, the critic almost always stops, unable quite to enter their sphere. Subtile beauties puzzle him; the titles of the poems, for instance, giving by delicate allusion the key-note of each-as Astraea, Mithridates,'' Hamatreya, and Etienne de la Boece,'--seem to him the work of mere caprice; he pronounces the poem of Monadnoc poor and weak; he condemns and satirizes the Wood-notes,' and thinks that a pine-tree which should talk like Mr. Emersons ought to be cut down and cast into the sea. 
The same want of fine discrimination was usually visible in his delineations of great men in public life Immense in accumulation of details, terrible in the justice which held the balance, they yet left one with the feeling, that, after all, the delicate main-springs of character had been missed. Broad contrasts, heaps of good and evil, almost exaggerated praises, pungent satire, catalogues of sins that seemed pages from some Recording Angels book-these were his mighty methods; but for the subtilest analysis, the deepest insight into the mysteries of character, one must look elsewhere. It was still scene-painting, not portraiture; and the same thing which overwhelmed with wonder, when heard in the Music Hall, produced a slight sense of insufficiency, when read in print It was certainly very great in its way, but not in quite the highest way; it was preliminary work, not final; it was Parkers Webster, not Emersons Swedenborg or Napoleon.
The same thing was often manifested in his criticisms on current events. The broad truths were stated without fear or favor, the finer points passed over, and the special trait of the particular phase sometimes missed. His sermons on the last revivals, for instance, had an enormous circulation, and told with great force upon those who had not been swept into the movement, and even upon some who had been. The difficulty was that they were just such discourses as he would have preached in the time of Edwards and the Great Awakening; and the point which many thought the one astonishing feature of the new excitement, its almost entire omission of the 'terrors of the Lord, the far gentler and more wining type of religion which it displayed, and from which it confessedly drew much of its power, this was entirely ignored in Mr. Parkers sermons. He was too hard at work in combating the evangelical theology to recognize its altered phases. Forging lightning-rods against the tempest, he did not see that the height of the storm had passed by. 
These are legitimate criticisms to make on Theodore Parker, for he was large enough to merit them. It is only the loftiest trees of which it occurs to us to remark that they do not touch the sky, and a man must comprise a great deal before we complain of him for not comprising everything. But though the closest scrutiny may sometimes find cases where he failed to see the most subtile and precious truth, it will never discover one where, seeing, he failed to proclaim it, or, proclaiming, failed to give it force and power. He lived his life much as he walked the streets of Boston,-not quite gracefully, nor yet statelily, but with quick, strong, solid step, with sagacious eyes wide open, and thrusting his broad shoulders a little forward, as if butting away the throng of evil
<c06>
deeds round him, and scattering whole atmospheres of unwholesome cloud. Wherever he went, there went a glance of sleepless vigilance, an unforgetting memory, a tongue that never faltered, and an arm that never quailed. Not primarily an administrative nor yet a military mind, he yet exerted a positive control over the whole community around him, by sheer mental and moral strength. He mowed down harvests of evil as in his youth he mowed the grass, and all his hours of study were but whetting the say the <illegible>.
And for this great work it is was not essential that the blade should have a razors edge. Grant that Parker was not also Emerson; no matter, he was Parker. If ever a man seemed sent into the world to find a certain position, and found it, he was that man. Occupying a unique sphere of activity, he filled it with such a wealth of success, that there is now no one in the nation whom it would not seem an absurdity to <illegble> for his place. It takes many instruments to complete the orchestra, but the tones of this organ the Music Hall shall never hear again.
One feels, since he is gone, that he made his great qualities seem so natural and inevitable, we forget that all did not share them. We forgot the scholars proverbial reproach of timidity and selfishness, in watching him. While he lived, it seemed a master of course that the greatest acquirements and the heartiest self-devotion should go together. Can we keep our strength, without the tonic of his example; How petty it now seems to ask for any fine-drawn subtilties of poet or seer in him who gave his life to the cause of the humblest! Life speaks the loudest. We do not ask what Luther said or wrote, but only what he did; and the name of Theodore Parker will not only long outlive his books, but will last for beyond the special occasions out of which he moulded his grand career.

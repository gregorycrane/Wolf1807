REFUGE OF OPPRESSION.
<C01>
THE PUNISHMENT DUE TO HIM WHO ASSISTS IN RESCUING A FUGITIVE SLAVE.
At the February Term of the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, John Hossack, worthy a citizen of Chicago, was convicted of having sided in rescuing a fugitive slave from the U.S. Deputy Marshal at Ottawa, Oct. 20th, 1859. The following are extracts from the Argument to the Jury of. A. W. Arrington, Counsel for the Prosecution. How unfathomable must be the moral degradation of such a pleader for slave-catching!
That Mr. Hossack, the defendant, was connected with rescue does not seem to admit of controversy. Judge Caton states in the most positive term that he saw him leading the negro out of the <illegible> by the arm. And the fact to which numerous witnesses testify, that he prevented Mr. Meyer from stopping the carriage when the fugitive was about to escape, fixes him as one of the most active participators in the commission of the crime. Nor must you forget the important circumstance that he was president of the midnight meeting, the secrets of which Bristol swears he cannot disclose without self-crimination. What kind of a gathering was that which involved words and deeds too criminal to <illegible> in open day? They called no one to it but the chosen few, the apostles of treason to the Constitution, and saints of sedition against all regulated authority. Even Roots tells you that the sentiments uttered there sounded strange to him, because he had not then taken as many degrees as he has done since. Mr. Phillips says that when a certain committee of philanthropists waited on him to purchase the slave, they informed him that they received their money from a sort of society, though, when cross examined, he could not remember very clearly what was said as to the nature of the organization.
Gentlemen, you obtain through this evidence some glimpses of that esoteric band of conspirators against law, of whom Mr. Phillips swears he heard before he had arrived at Ottawa. Mr. Roots, who, being a member, has the means of knowing, tells you that this organization is a mystic hierarchy, arranged on a scale of ascending degrees. And the defendant is its president. What principle constitutes that society? What are its signs and watch words? These are questions it might trouble any but the highest of the initiated to answer. And yet. from the atrocious character of the doctrines publicly taught by the hierophants, and seditious nature of the acts done by the vulgar herd of disciples, one can readily imagine all the mysteries. The first of the watchwords for the lowest degree is a text from the Bible, corrupted after the manner of the citation adopted by General Knox: 'Peace on earth and liberty to men!' This sounds kindly and Christian-like so as not to arouse the fears of new converts, who have not as yet lost their reverence for order and legitimate authority. Next, when the pupil becomes sufficiently advanced, they baptize him into the second degree, and whisper the watch word, ' Down with the Fugitive Slave Law! ' At this stage of his progress, the graduate exhibits an astonishing metamorphosis. He suddenly grows eloquent. His in wild gleamings betray the volcano of words without ideas beginning to burn in his brain and bosom. His lips blaze with live lightning's as he shouts, ' Down with the Fugitive Slave Law!' You know him by one glance, or the fall of a single sentence, for an orator of the Wendell Phillips and Garrison school. He is potent in extravagant laudations of England, and omnipotent in dealing out damnation against the laws and institutions of the country that protects him. He is mighty in the of Fox and Wilberforce, but majestic in the art of cursing the names of Washington and Jefferson. Then after the lapse of a short probationary term-for the course of crime is swilter than the wings of the eagle-the aspirant is prepared for the third degree. Here the cry is, Crush the Constitution; it is a league with death and a convent with hell.' one'' itself, more decent than they, blushes at the profanation. The men of this degree are mostly step-sons of America, whose only purpose in submitting to the rights of adoption appears to be the finding of an occasion to stab the bosom of the generous country that receives them as her own sons. And now the proficient in the great science of coalesced sin and folly is ripe for the highest degree, that one which no stretch of genius can grasp until it has run as conductor on the underground railroad for a dozen years, and stolen property, protected by the Constitution, to the value of a hundred thousand dollars! And then they whisper in the arch robber's ears the final token, a travestied line from Horace: 'Hic niggerest, hunc tu Romane amato,' and give it a free translation: 'Love the nigger only-hate everybody else.'
Gentlemen, they dare talk here of a partisan triumph. They blush not to use here the language of the hustings. Well, gentlemen, in one sense, a verdict for the prosecution would be a partisan triumph; but it would be a triumph in favor of that party alone which stands on the Constitution; and that party is an immense majority of the American people-all save the few preachers of disunion at the South, and the few disciples of the devil's gospel of abolition at the North.
Why, gentlemen, if Mr. Arnold excommunicates you, even General Konx himself will vouchsafe you absolution; for he, too, believes in the constitutionality of a Fugitive Slave Law. And here I wish, in passing, to remark that the General suggested one brilliant invention in the administration of political justice, of which I cannot forbear to express my most hearty approval. He said, in the opening of his speech, that if the Southern fire-eaters and the Northern agitators could only all be caught and collected together, he would vote for a law to gag them. Now, it strikes my mind, that of all possible species of punishment, that of gagging would be most appropriate to their common offence. Some have proposed hanging. But that would be maliciously cruel, and worse still, altogether ineffectual. The bones of a genuine Abolitionist will not lie quiet in the grave, though you should bury him a hundred feet under the sod. His very ashes would stir if a negro walked over them; and the withered tongue would cry, in the music of Tennyson:-
'He is coming, my own, my sweet, it ever so airy a tread, My would hear it and beat; Were it earth in an earthly bed, My dust would hear it and beat Had I lain for a century dead, Would start and tremble under his feet, And blossom in purple and red! 'No dead pupil of Garrison could keep still under the foot of a negro. The flushness joints would leap up, and rattle with sedition's life. Therefore, let them live; but gag them kindly, with an easy gag, and thus inflict a mild penalty upon that unruly member that makes them dangerous. An Abolition-
<c02>
the mouth, and there he is incomparably more poisonous than tooth of serpent or dog. No, or constitution, or law, or religion, can stand up against his bark, much less against his bite. Modern schools are chiefly employed in teaching boys and men the arts of eloquent speech; but perchance, the plan of old Pythagoras was wiser, for he taught his pupils, not alone how to talk, but first of all, how to hold their tongues, placing them sub silentio for a period of seven years. Try the remedy upon these men. Teach them, by the silence of seven years, the beauties of obedience to law, the philosophy of reverence for government. Then we should hear no more of this railing at the Constitution, no more of these big, swelling words about things they know not, no more double prayers and maledictions of pseudo saints standing in the holy places, and with sanctimonious visages, up-turned stony eyes, close clean shaved lips, and hearts of ice, thanking God that they are not like the publicans and sinners of the South. Gag them! Silence the clamor of those pharisees who have literally turned the temple of religion into a den of negro thieves! And I know of no means calculated to operate more effectually in the right direction than a verdict against this defendant. One such lesson, to show the law strong enough to enforce its own sanctions, may do more good than ten thousand sermons on the text of the Constitution. ' But,' they cry, with simulated tears and in lugubrious tones, ' your verdict will consign this defendant to the penitentiary! ' Does any man believe that? And, even were it so, what would be the harm? These rescuers have a wonderful faculty for escaping from legitimate confinement. They have been nominally in prison already, but only for an instant. They walked in merely to walk out again, and without bail or mainprise. No, gentlemen, their prison was, as their prison will be, the Revere House. Nor do we ask of the Court any penitentiary service on the part of the defendant. We are content with the penalty suggested by Gen. Knox himself. We will entreat his honor to have Mr. Hossack comfortably gagged, and leave him alone for a little while, to ponder on the Constitution he has violated and the laws he has outraged with insurrectionary mob force.
In conclusion, gentlemen, let say again, and for the last time, that by no efforts of ingenuity, or falsehood, can your verdict be misrepresented as a party triumph. It is the Constitution of your country and the majesty of its violated laws that call for a verdict of guilty. It is the voice of your fathers from the dust of their glorious graves which demands a vindication of their memory. Oh! by the names of the great men gone, who made this law, I adjure you to do your duty! In the name of Henry Clay, whose character, like the statue of the Apollo Belvidere, was as crystal stone from the heart of the everlasting hills; though the scavengers of politics once cast their faith upon it, too, and the low herd of knaves and dupes begrimed it with the impress of base fingers touched by bribes, yet the flow of a nation's tears in the late remorse of love have washed it all away, and left no stain on the marble; by the name of Daniel Webster, that mind majestic as Olympian Jove, when pealing the trumpet of thunder, and beautiful in golden words as the god of the morning in purple splendors, that most potent intellect the western half world has ever seen, or will see, realizing the line of the Roman poet, simile aut secundum,' -without an equal and without a second; by the name of George Washington, that greatest name in the annals of all humanity, the name of him who signed the first Fugitive Slave Law; by all the names -that galaxy of immortal lights-affixed forever to the Constitution of your country; by all these, and, aye, by every star on the banner which their bravery flung to the sky, I implore you, gentlemen, to do your duty, for your own sakes, for the sake of the memory of such ancestors, and above all and before all, for the sake of that Union which gives us and our children a name among the nations of the earth
SELECTIONS.
From the Chicago Democrat.
SPEECH OF JOHN HOSSACK,
Convicted of Violation of the Fugitive Slave Law, before Judge Drummond, of the U. S. District Court of Chicago.
May it please the Court: I have a few words to say why sentence should not be pronounced against me. I am found guilty of a violation of the Fugitive Slave Law, and it may appear strange to your Honor that I have no sense of guilt. I came, sir, from the tyranny of the Old World, when but a lad, landed upon the American shores, having left my kindred and native land in pursuit of some place where men of toil would not be crushed by the property-holding class. Commencing the struggle of life at the tender age of 12 years, a stranger in a strange land, having to earn my bread by the sweat of my brow, your Honor will bear with me, unaccustomed as I am to appear in Courts, much less to address them. I have feared that I might fail in bearing myself on this occasion worthy of the place and the position I occupy, and the great principles involved in the case before you. I say to your Honor, therefore, if I fail in observing the usual forms of the place, it will be from a want of judgment and error of the head, and not of the heart. Therefore I do not think I shall fare worse at the hands of your Honor, if I state plainly my views and feelings on the great question of the age -the rights of man. I feel that it is a case that will be referred to long after you and I have gone to meet the great Judge of all the earth.
It has been argued by the prosecution that I, a foreigner, protected by the laws of my adopted country, should be the last to disobey those laws; but in this I find nothing that should destroy any sympathy for the crushed, struggling children of toil in all lands.
Surely I have been protected. The fish in the rivers, the quail in the stubble, the deer in the forest, have been protected. Shall I join hands with those who make wicked laws, in crushing out the poor black man, for whom there is no protection but in the grave, where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest?
It is true, sir-I am a foreigner. I first saw the light among the rugged but free hills of Scotland; a land, sir, that never was conquered, and where a slave never breathed. Let a slave set foot on that shore, and his chains fall off forever, and he becomes what God made him-a man. In this far-off land I heard of your free institutions, your prairie lands, your projected canals, and your growing towns. Twenty-two years ago I landed in this city. immediately engaged on the public works, on the canal then building that connects this city with the great river of the West. In the process of time, the State failed to procure money to carry on the public works. I then opened a prairie farm to get bread for my family, and I am one of the men that made Chicago what it is to-day, having shipped some of the first grain that was exported from this city. I am, sir, one of the pioneers of Illinois, who have gone through the many hardships of the settlement
<c03>
of a new country. I have spent my best days, the strength of my manhood. I have eleven children, who are natives of this my adopted country. No living man, sir, has greater interest in its welfare; and it is because I am opposed to carrying out wicked and ungodly laws, and love the freedom of my country, that I stand before you to-day.
Again, sir, I ought not to be sentenced because, as has been argued by the prosecution, I am an Abolitionist. I have no apologies to make for being an Abolitionist. When I came to this country, like the mass from beyond the sea, I was a Democrat; there was a charm in the name. But, sir, I soon found I had to go beyond the name of a party in this country, in order to know anything of its principles or practice. I soon found that however much the great parties of my adopted country differed upon banks, tariffs and land questions in one thing they agreed, in trying which could stop the lowest to gain the favor of the most cursed system of slavery that ever swayed an iron rod over any nation, the Moloch which they had set up, to which they offered as human sacrifice millions of the children of toil. As a man who had fled from the crushing aristocracy of my native land, how can I support a worse aristocracy in this land? I was compelled to give my humble name and influence to a party who proposed, at least, to embrace in its sympathies all classes of men, from all quarters of the globe. In this choice I found myself in the company of Clarkson and Will be force in my native land, and of Washington and Franklin, and many such, in this boasted land of the free; and more than all these, the Redeemer in whom I humbly trust for acceptance with my God, who came to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, to set at liberty those who were bruised; yea, this very religion binds me to those in bonds as bound with them. Tell me, sir, with these views, can I be anything but an Abolitionist? Surely for this I ought not to be sentenced.
Again, sir, I ought not to be sentenced, because the Fugitive Slave Law under which I am torn from my family and business by the subtle tools of the Slave Power, the slave-breeder and the slave-hunter, is at variance with both the spirit and letter of the Constitution. Sir, I place myself upon the Constitution in the presence of a nation who have the Declaration of Independence read to them every Fourth of July, and profess to believe it. Yea, in the presence of civilized man, I hold up the Constitution of my adopted country as clear from the blood of men, and from a tyranny that would make crowned heads blush. The parties who prostitute the Constitution to the support of slavery are traitors-traitors not only to the liberties of millions of enslaved countrymen, but traitors to the Constitution itself, which they have sworn to support. A foreigner upon your soil, I go not to the platforms of contending parties to find truth. I go, sir, to the Constitution of my country: the word slave is not to be found. I read, ' We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice,'-yes, sir, establish justice,-' to promote the general welfare and to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.' These were the men that had proclaimed to the world that all men were created equal; that they were endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights-life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and contended even unto death for seven long years. Can it be, sir, that these great men, under cover of those hallowed words, intended to make a government that should outrage justice and trample upon liberty as no other government under the whole heavens has ever done? This dreadful power that has compelled the great political parties of the country to creep in the dust for its power; that has debauched to a large extent the Christianity of the nation; that bids a craven priesthood stand with golden rule in hand, and defend the robbing of mothers of their babes, and husbands of their wives; that bids courts decree injustice. Sir, I plant myself upon the Constitution, and demand justice and liberty, and say to this bloody Moloch, away! Sir, the world has never furnished so great a congregation of hypocrites as those that formed the Constitution, if they designed to make it the greatest slaveholder, slave-breeder, and slave-catcher on earth. He is a great slaveholder that has a thousand slaves; but if this law is a true exponent of the Constitution, this Government ordained for justice and liberty holds four millions of slaves.
No, sir! no! for the honor of the fathers of my country, I appeal from the bloody slaveholding statute to the liberty-loving Constitution. While these fathers lived, State after State, in carrying out the spirit of the Constitution, put an end to the dreadful system. The great Washington, in his last will and testament, carried out the spirit of the Constitution. But, sir, the law under which you may sentence me, violates both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution. I have a word to say upon the articles of the Constitution which it is claimed the Fugitive Slave Law is designed to carry out. ' No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on the claim of the party to whom such service or labor is due.' That is the provision that is claimed transforms the Government into a monster of iniquity. I have read, over and over, that article interpreted by all laws of language known to a plain man. How these three or four lines can transform this Government, ordained to secure justice, into a mean tool to aid the plunderers of cradles, the destroyers of homes, the ravishers of women, and the oppressors of men, to carry on. their hellish work-now it can do this thing, I cannot see. That article binds the several States separately not to pass a certain law, but where in it do we find a Fugitive Slave Law? Where do you find a Commissioner? Where do you find that the Government is to hunt up and return at its own expense a slave that flees from his cruel and bloody master? Where in those lines is the authority to compel me to be a partaker in the crimes of the man-stealer? The General Government is not once mentioned; but the States in their separate sovereignties are named. But, sir, this article expressly provides that the party making the claim shall have owed him service or labor due from the party claimed. If Jim Grey owed service or labor, or money, to Phillips, I am the last man in the world to raise my voice or hand to prevent Phillips, or any man, from obtaining their dues. What I would grant to the devil himself, I would not withhold even from the slaveholder-his due. Jim Gray claims that he does not owe Phillips a day's work or a dollar of money. Phillips claims that he owes him every day's work that has been deposited his bones and sinews;, the toil of his body and mind both, till death shall end the period of stipulated toil. Here is a question for legal examination and judicial discussion. Does the man Gray owe this man Phillips anything? The Constitution is very clear and very plain in pointing out the way this question is to be settled.
Article-provides that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due pro-
<c04>
cess of law. That Jim. Gray is a person, is admitted on all hands. Phillips admits it; the blood-hounds, marshals and attorneys that hunt him, say he is a person -<illegible> person held to service. The amount in dispute is the liberty and life-long toil of a man just entering into the full maturity of man-hood. A great question lies between these men. But Gray, standing on soil covered by this Constitution, can be robbed of liberty, or the wages of his toil, only by due process of law.
Article-says, expressly, in suits at common law, when the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. Here, sir, is a case involving the question of liberty, and hundreds of dollars of money. The law, sir, under which I appear before you, overrides these plain provisions, and commits this whole question to one man, and offers him a bribe to trample right and liberty under foot. I know, sir, it may be said Jim Gray was a slave, and not entitled to these humane provisions. Had he never worn the chain of the oppressor, nor felt the lash of the bloody task-master-had he been born in, or anywhere else on the globe-had he been a citizen of one of the States of this Union, and never been enslaved, it would have been all the same. His liberty would have been stricken down, and been given to the party claiming his life-long toil, and your Commissioner would have pocketed the bribe offered by this law for doing such a crime against humanity and the plainest provisions of the Constitution
No, sir; in a Court of the United States, while the Constitution provides for trial by jury, I ought not to be sentenced for raising my hand to rescue a fellow man from a mob that would strip him of his liberty and life-long toil without due process of law, without trial by jury. Sir, this law tramples so, flagrantly upon the spirit and letter of the Constitution, that I ought not to be sentenced.
Before passing from the Constitutional objections to this law, I would call the attention of your Honor to the partiality of the law, which is so at variance with the designs of the Fathers in organizing this Government. No man can read the Constitution-in which the word slave cannot be found; from which the idea that a man could be reduced to a thing, and held as property, was carefully excluded-no man, I say, can read that Constitution, and come to the conclusion that slavery was to be fostered, guaranteed and protected far beyond everything else in the country. "Admit that Jim Gray was Phillips's property, how comes it that that particular property is more sacred than any other property? Phillips's horse escapes from him, and is found in a distant State, but the President of the United States, and every department of Government, is not put on the track until the horse is found, and then return him to Phillips's stable, and then pay the whole bill from the National Treasury. No, sir. But his slave escapes-he runs away, and, for some reason, his property in man is so much more holy and sacred, that the whole Government is bound to take the track and hunt the poor, panting fugitive down, and carry him back to his chains and bondage at the Government's expense.
Sir, under a Constitution unstained by the word slave, we have a law magnifying slave property above all other property in the nation-a law giving it guarantees that no other property could possibly obtain. Sir, the partiality of this law is so great, that it stands opposed to a Constitution that guarantees equal justice and protection to all.
John G. Fee is driven out of his Kentucky home, and robbed of the fruits of his life-long toil. There is no power to secure him his home, or protect him in his rights of property or opinion. But had John G. Fee only owned a slave, and his slave escaped, the Government, under this law, would have followed his slave to the utmost limit of the United States, and returned his slave to him at its own expense. Your Honor will pardon me, (if I need pardon,) but I cannot, for the life of me, see what there is in robbing a man of his inalienable rights and enslaving him for life, that should entitle it to the special and peculiar protection of national law.
I am aware, sir, that I shall be reminded that judges, marshals, attorneys and many citizens, regard this law as Constitutional, and stand ready to execute it, though it trample every principle of the Declaration of Independence in the dust. Sir, no law can be enacted so bad but that it will find men deluded or base enough to execute it. The law of Egypt that consigned the new-born babe to the slaughter found tools for its execution. The bloody decree of Herod found man ready to obey the law of the country, though it commanded the slaughter of the innocents of a province. Sir, tell me not of men ready and willing to execute the law. My Redeemer, whose name I am hardly worthy to speak, and yet whose name is all trust, although he knew no sin, yet he was crucified by law.
Again, sir, it will be seen that some whom the world calls doctors of divinity and doctors of law, have undertaken to prove slavery was guaranteed by the Constitution. If that be so, in the name of the Most High God, tear out the red strip of blood; it was not written by the Angel Gabriel, nor nailed to the throne of the Almighty. If slavery is in it, it is a covenant with death and an agreement with hell. 
But, sir, I have one consideration more that I will urge why sentence ought not to be pronounced against me. This law, which I think I have proved outrageous to the rights of man, is so obviously at variance with the law of that God who commands me to love Him with all my soul, mind, might and strength, and my neighbor as myself, and the Redeemer that took upon him my nature and the nature of poor Jim Gray, has been so particular in telling me who my neighbor is, that the path of duty is plain to me. This law so plainly tramples upon the divine law, that it cannot be binding upon my human being under any circumstances to obey it. The law that bids me do to other men as I would have other men do to me, is too plain, too simple to be misunderstood., sir, I am now left to the general law of love in searching for my duty in this particular case. Permit me to refer your Honor to the oldest law-book in existence, though it may not be in use in this court, yet I think it better authority than Blackstone or any law-book that ever was written. It is the book of books. In that book I find some special enactments given to the Hebrew commonwealth that leave me in no doubt as to my duty in reference to this law. 'He that stealth a man and selleth him, or if he be found in his hands, he shall surely be put to death. Again, ' Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant that has escaped from his master unto thee; he shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place he shall choose in one of thy gates where it liketh him best; thou shalt not oppress him.' These plain statutes, with many more that I might give, leave me in no doubt as to the mind of the unchanging Jehovah, in reference to man-stealing and slave-hunting. Sir, the whole system of slavery originated in man-stealing, and is perpetuated by fraud and violence and plunder. Others may have their doubts as to their duty under this law; I, sir, have none. This law is just as binding on me as was the law of Egypt to slaughter Hebrew children; just as binding as the law
<c05>
that said, worship the golden image, worship not God; just as binding as the law forbidding Christ and his Apostles to preach the Gospel. Send me a law bidding me rob or murder my neighbor, I must decline to obey it. I can suffer, but I must not do wrong. Send me a law bidding me join hands in robbing fellow-men of their freedom, I cannot do so great a wrong. Yea, send me a law bidding me stop my ears to the cry of the poor, I can suffer the loss of all these hands have earned, I can suffer bonds and imprisonment-yes, God helping me, I can give up my life, but I cannot knowingly trample upon the law of my God, nor upon the bleeding, prostrate form of my fellow-man. I go not to Missouri to relieve oppressed humanity, for my duty has called me nearer home; but when He that directs the steps of man conducts a poor, oppressed, panting fugitive to my door, and there I hear his bitter cry, I dare not close my ear against it, lest in my extremity I cry for mercy, and shall not heard. Sir, this law so flagrantly outrages the divine law that I ought not to by sentenced under it.
A single remark, and I have done. From the testimony (part of which is false) and from your rendering and interpretation of the law, the Jury have found me guilty; yes, guilty of carrying out the great principles of the Declaration of Independence; yes, guilty of carrying out the still greater principles of the Son of God. Great God! can these things be? Can it be possible? What country is this? Can it be that I live in a land boasting of freedom, of morality, of Christianity? How long, O, how long shall the people bow down and worship this great image set up in this nation? Yes, the Jury say guilty, but recommend me to the mercy of the Court. Mercy, sir, is kindness to the guilty. I am guilty of no crime, I therefore ask for no mercy. No, sir, I ask for no mercy; I ask for justice. Mercy is what I ask of my God. Justice in the courts of my adopted country is all I ask. It is the inhuman and infamous law that is wrong, not me. My feelings are at my home. My wife and my children are dear to heart; but, sir, I have counted the cost. I am ready to die, if need be, for the oppressed of my race. But slavery must die; and when my country shall have passed through the terrible conflict which the destruction of slavery must cost, and when the history of the great struggle shall be candidly written, the rescuers of Jim Gray will be considered as having done honor to God, to humanity, and to themselves.
I am told there is no appeal from this Court, yet I do appeal to the court of high Heaven, when Judge Drummond and Judge Caton, the rescuer and the rescued, shall all have to stand at the judgment seat of the Most High.
I have, sir, endeavored to obey the Divine law and all the laws of my country that do not conflict with the laws of my God. My humble wish is, that it may then appear that I have done my duty. All I wish to be written on my tomb stone is, ' He feared God and loved his fellow-men.'
LETTER FROM THE JAIL.
CHICAGO JAIL, Oct. 3, 1860.Citizens of Cook County:-From your own jail, erected for the safe keeping of criminals, I take the liberty of addressing you a word. I find myself surrounded by walls and bars, and associated with men charged or convicted of crimes against the peace of society, the life or property of individuals. Who am I that you, citizens of the State of Illinois, should erect such a place as this, and give me a place in it? I am a native of the free hills of Scotland. In an early day I sought your beautiful prairies, and, with the blessing of God upon the labors of my hands, made a home for my family. When your noble city-noble in its youthful vigor, more noble in its future-when it becomes the western terminus of our direct European trade, and the great western shipping-port for the garden of the North American continent; yes, I may say, your noble city, when it was a small village, a mere trading-post, when there was neither railroad nor canal leading to it, I here exchanged my grain for supplies for my family. Since that day of small things, I have aided in opening your canal, and over it have sent millions of bushels of grain to your city, and have taken from it many millions of feet of lumber. In all of this time, I have endeavored to live peaceably with all men, and to provide things honest in the sight of all. Conscious as I am of many failings and imperfections, I am conscious of no one act, in all this time, where I intended to injure the person or property of one of my fellow-men; and I know not, one man in the State of Illinois, yea, in the whole world, that I would do ought but good to, if it were in my power.
Friends and neighbors know that nothing but my peculiar circumstances would lead me to write thus in reference to myself. Fellow-citizens, you build jails and open their doors to innocent men, and tender the services of your Sheriffs and Jailers to the oligarchy of the South to hold such men as myself. What injury have I done to Cook county that she should open her jails, and give me a place among her murderers and robbers? Last autumn a fellow-man, it was claimed, escaped from the house of bondage. That Providence that orders the steps of all men directed him near to my door. I saw what I thought was a conspiracy of the Judge, Mayor, and attorneys, Marshals and slave-hunters, to reduce that man to slavery, in violation of the Constitution of the country. In that emergency, I simply tried to do my duty to Jim Gray. I did just what I should do again, if I should find you or one of your sons in the same circumstances-their liberty exposed and trial by jury denied them. I know not that I have injured any living man in this transaction. Fellow-citizens, is this a free State or not? If Missouri has the power to hold slaves, and you cannot interfere, have you not the right to be free from slavery? Does the law of this State seize upon the public property of the counties, and place it in the hands of slave-hunters? Does the law of State take your servants, the Sheriffs and Jailers, and bind them over to the supple tools of the oligarchy that treads upon the necks of four millions of human beings at home, and then claim the right to trample upon you? Are you compelled to do this by the law of the State, or do you volunteer your jails and Sheriffs, that innocent men have a place with the guilty? If it is the law of Illinois that opens Cook county jail to me as a felon, for what true and good men over the world will say is no crime, ought not that law to be repealed? If it is Cook county that opens her jails to receive men for acts, which, if done in behalf of white men, would be extolled everywhere, ought you not to arise and rid yourselves all responsibility in enslaving colored men, and all responsibility in imprisoning honest men of your own State? Gladly would I lay in this prison, if it would arouse the people of this State to control their own jails, Sheriffs and Jailers, and decree an eternal divorce between them and the despotism that wields the General Government, that blights Territories and stalks over the free States, imprisoning whom it pleases, and when it pleases. Men of Cook, if Liberty is not a farce, I ask you to ponder these things.
JOHN HOSSACK,
Cook County Prison.
<c06>
From the Chicago Democrat.
THE SPEECH OF JOHN HOSSACK.
The speech of John Hossack, printed in the Democrat of yesterday, produced a profound impression in this community. The demand for copies of the paper containing it was large, and as our edition was exhausted before the demand was satisfied, we reprint it this morning on our third page.
The fines imposed upon Mr. Hossack, his brother, and Mr. King, all found guilty of having in their hearts the common sympathies of humanity, although light in themselves, carry with them the entire costs of the prosecution in each of the cases, some of which were tried twice. Not only must they pay into the Treasury of the Federal Government the sum of one hundred dollars, fifty dollars, and ten dollars each, but they must pay the fees of the lawyers who prosecuted them, of the jury which found them guilty, and the cloud of witnesses, slave owners, slave-catchers, and United States Marshals, who bore witness against them. We are told that these costs will amount to some $2,500 in each case. This sum these men are not able to pay-even if they were so inclined; and the consequence is that they must languish in our county jail, amid felons and harlots, until some providential deliverance shall release them. They are thus punished because they did for a fellow-man, what every one of us would do even for a hunted and persecuted dog. For obeying the dictates of common humanity and of pure Christianity, they must thus suffer. And this is the latter half of the 19th century!
Lost night, as Hossack and his two companions in bondage stood at the grated windows of their cells, and beheld long lines of men, dressed in uniform, bearing torches, marching to the sound of martial music, and piercing the ear of night with acclamations of honor to Stephen A. Douglas. That statesman claims, as one of his chief recommendations to public honor and esteem, the fact that he labored and voted for the passage of the law, under the provisions of which these men, of pure and blameless life, are now torn from their families and immured with felons. On one side of the grates were men who had done only what Christ and his apostles would have done-what every man with a heart true to humanity must have done. On the other, a man who at the best cares not whether slavery is voted up or voted down-cares not whether our country shall be free or slave-cares not whether the laborer shall own his own sinews and the fruits of his own toil, or whether they shall be the property of another. The friends of freedom are rewarded with a prison cell and prison fare. For the enemy of freedom-or at least the equal friend of slavery and freedom-are proud processions, shouts of welcome, enthusiastic manifestations of honor and delight. And yet this is America-the land for whose freedom Washington fought and Pulaski fell!
WHAT SHALL BE DONE?-ARE WE HYPOCRITES, OR ARE WE NOT?-IMPRISONMENT OF HOSSACK.-Yesterday afternoon, Mayor Wentworth, after reading the letter Mr. Hossack, went to the jail, for the express purpose of paying his fine, and liberating him, when, to his great surprise, he found another gentleman with him, Mr. King, imprisoned for the same offence. He there learned that the costs in each case amounted to between $2,000 and $2,500, and that the prisoners were to stand committed until they were paid. Not only so, but they have got to stay until they pay their own board; for the United States has to pay this to Cook county, and the United States charges this expense over to the prisoners, refusing to liberate them until the whole is paid. This comes as near to eternal imprisonment as any thing in this world can; for, as these gentlemen are poor, and unable to pay the costs, the bill will daily increase against them, and the longer they stay, the longer will they have to stay. So, if any one is going to help them, that help should be extended at once.
There are many persons who say, that if the Republicans help these prisoners until after election, it will hurt the Republican prospects! These men said that our articles about John Brown would hurt our prospects; but we ran for Mayor, and if we lost a vote by them, we are not aware of it. On the contrary, they gave us strength with the men of heart. So the mere spoilsmen, the other night, said, if our torchlight procession went by the Tremont House, where Gov. Seward stopped, it would be called a Seward procession, and thereby injure their prospects for office - because Mr. Seward is unpopular with the friends of slavery, many of whom they want to fool into the support of their ticket.
We left the Democratic organization entirely upon this one idea of slavery. The Republican party has no other idea. Everything else is as common to the Douglas men as to the Republican party. Speak of a Tariff, Homestead Bill, Pacific Railroad, etc., etc., and the Douglas men will tell you they agree with you-and we believe they do. Speak of the right of man to enslave his fellow-man, and there is a quarrel at once.
We justify no violation of any law. The Fugitive Slave Law is an infamous one. The Southern people go to the coast of Guinea, and steal a freeman. He escapes to Illinois. Some one comes from the South-we do not know whether he is a kidnapper or not, and claims him as his slave. The negro says he is free; the white man says he is a slave. Now we admit that the Constitution requires us to send the negro South, when proven to be a slave. But the present Fugitive Slave Law embraces more than the Constitution requires of the North. There is no trial in the free States; the trial take place in a slave State, and if a white man goes to defend the negro, he is mobbed, or tarred and feathered, if not murdered. Every day's newspaper brings us an account of negroes who are stolen from the coast of Guinea. John Hossack, not knowing but the negro Jim Gray might be one of these, and having no chance to prove it without endangering his life by going South, assists the negro on his way to liberty. In this, what did he more than tens of thousands of men, women and children in the North would have done, under the same circumstances?
The Fugitive Slave Law is infamous in its provisions, and there are circumstances under which almost every Northern man will violate it Mr. Hossack is a man of heart His sympathies are with the oppressed of humanity. He is a sufferer in the cause of Republicanism. Shall we turn our back upon him, and prove ourselves before the world hypocrites in our support of the Republican organization? 
Where is our State Central Committee? Have they not collected thousands this year to be expended for the good of the cause? How better could they expend the contributions of a willing people than to liberate Mr. Hossack from jail? Is it not better to pay Republican money for John Hossack, than to pay it to Herr Kreismann, and such men as controlled the late Convention in Chicago? Old Line-Abolitionists, where are you? Will you longer contribute to the Republican when its State Central Committee allows Hossack to remain as he is?
Where are our candidates in Cook county for the coming year, who need the votes of Old-Line Abolitionists? Are they afraid of hurting the party? Are they afraid that old fogyism will denounce them, if they give one cent to suffering humanity?
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
The United States Constitution is 'a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell.'
The free States are the guardians and essential supports of slavery. We are the jailers and constables of the institution.... There is some excuse for communities, when, under a generous impulse, they espouse the cause of the oppressed in other States, and by force restore their rights; but they are without excuse in aiding other States in binding on men an unrighteous yoke. On this subject, OUR FATHERS, IN FRAMING THE CONSTITUTION, SWERVED FROM THE RIGHT. "We their children, at the end of half a century, see the path of duty more clearly than they, and must walk in it. To this point the public mind has long been tending, and the time has come for looking at it fully, dispassionately, and with manly and Christian resolution.... No blessing of the "Onion can be a compensation for taking part in the enslaving of our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to be perpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that it can only continue through our participation in wrong doing. To this conviction the free States an tending.' -WILLIAM BLLERY CHANNING.

Shall we not have a public meeting on this matter? Who will lead off? We are ready to follow. Let us never have a Republican meeting in this city, except to Hossack and his companions in imprisonment, until their fines and the costs are paid. Men of hearts! where are you? Are that the of a few party leaders shall disgrace the whole party with the charge of heartlessness? Let us have a public meeting. What say you?
 SHALL HOSSACK ROT IN JAIL?
We are obliged, in order to supply the extraordinary and unceasing demand for it, to reprint this morning, for the third time, the speech of John Hossack, delivered in the United States Court, when asked why sentence should not be pronounced upon him for a violation of the Fugitive Slave Law.
We first printed this remarkable speech on Friday morning. It immediately created a marked sensation in the city, notwithstanding the town was filled with the crowds who had gathered here to welcome Senator Douglas. Our regular edition to supply the demand for the speech at our counter. We re-inserted the speech in our paper, for the second time, on Saturday morning. We were obliged to print three editions of this issue in order to supply the demand; and after our forms had been taken up stairs, orders came in for 500 copies which we were unable to supply, so that we are obliged to re-print it again to-day, and even the large extra edition we shall strike off will probably fail to satisfy the demand which will be made for the paper.
What does all this mean? Simply that the heart of the people has been touched. The noble, simple, dignified and truthful utterances of John Hossack have touched a chord in the heart of the people-poor and rich, obscure and prominent, Democrat and Republican.
Let the people go to see Mr. Hossack to-day in jail. They need not be ashamed or afraid to go-
�Stone walls do not a prison make,
Nor iron bars a cage;
A willing and contented mind
Makes these a hermitage;'
and the deed for which John Hossack is imprisoned in our common jail sheds a halo of glory around its gloomy walls, which no man to-day need be ashamed to share.
We justify no violation of any law. Our whole life will bear us in the assertion, that we have always contended for the enforcement of every law, as long as it remained on the statute-book. If laws are unjust, let us go to work to repeal them. The best way to bring home the injustice of a bad law is to enforce it honestly. This very imprisonment and suffering of Hossack and his companions under the provisions of this infamous Fugitive Slave Law, will go far toward creating that state of feeling which will demand its repeal or modification. 
But Mr. Hossack believed he was violating no law. Read his speech, and see if his defence is not unanswerable. Every day we hear of free negroes being stolen from the coast of Africa, and brought to our shores. Now, there is every reason to believe that Jim Gray, the negro for whose rescue Mr. Hossack is punished, was stolen five or six years, from the coast of Africa, and was never legally a slave. The Fugitive Slave Law does not provide for the rendition of free black men to any kidnap- per who may come after then. It provides only for the return of slaves�and Mr. Hossack did not believe Jim Gray to be a slave.
But read his speech, and then go and see him. We print in another place this morning a letter from a Scotchman, who says he is willing to do his share toward paying the costs of Mr. Hossack's trial and conviction, for which he is now imprisoned.
Scotchmen of Chicago! go and see this country-man of yours, imprisoned for an act which in Scot-land would make his name honored from Glasgow to the Highlands. He came to America because he loved Freedom which he learned in Scotland, he is treated as a felon in America. Go and see him, and comfort him.
Ministers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ! Remember, that for obeying the commands of his Redeemer, who has told us to re-member those in bonds as bound with them, he is cast into prison. On this Sabbath morning, he hears the sweet chime of the church bells�but, like Peter the apostle, he is imprisoned, and as yet the of the Lord has not appeared to break his bonds. The days of miracles are past. The disciples of old prayed for Peter's liberation, and as they yet prayed, he knocked at the gate for admission. It will take paying as well as praying to get John Hossack out of jail.
Old Line Abolitionists! go and see John Hossack! He is one of your noblest brethren. He has something to tell you which will make you wiser and, perhaps, sadder men. It is a very strange thing the Chicago Democrat is the only paper in this city which has dared to publish his speech in his own defence.�Chicago Democrat, 8th inst.
From the Chicago Times and Herald.
THE OTTAWA SEDITION CASE.
The following are the remarks of the Hon. Thos. m of the U. S. District Court, on the occasion of passing sentence upon the prisoners Hossack, Stout and King, convicted for violating the Fugitive Slave Law at Ottawa.
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT.
The United States John Hossack and others. October Term, 1860.
The defendants were brought before the Court for sentence, having been tried and convicted for rescuing a fugitive slave at Ottawa, on the 20th of October, 1859.
The Court said that inasmuch as some of the questions of law which had been presented in these cases were new, it was the wish of the Court to consult the Judge of the Supreme Court for this circuit, Mr. Justice McLean, upon the points involved, before sentence was pronounced. The whole history of the case, including all the testimony, the ruling of the Court, and the argument of the counsel upon the questions of law, had been presented to him, and by him considered, and he had expressed his entire concurrence upon every point ruled. It only remained, therefore, to pass the sentence of the law upon the defendants. John Hossack, one of the defendants, in answer to the question why sentence should not be pronounced, then requested leave to state some reasons why sentence upon him should not be passed, and on the Court granting the permission asked, read a long written protest against the action of the Court, which has been published. When Hossack concluded, the Court addressed him substantially as follows:�
It is proper to premise that though Hossack had intimated to the Judge personally, immediately before the meeting of the Court, that he wished to say something, and the Judge had stated he might do so, provided he did not abuse the privilege, the Court did not expect such a paper as was read, and consequently what was said by the Court was said at the moment without notes, and there was no reporter present. It is possible, therefore, in the statement of what follows, as it is given from memory, there may be a few sentences which were not actually spoken, and that there may have been some spoken which are not here set down. The object has been merely to give the leading ideas of the Court in the remarks which were made.
The Court�Judge Drummond. It is rather an abuse of the privilege allowed to you to read such a document as we have just beard. If I understand it correctly, the substantial part of it is that you insist that the law under which you have been convicted is unconstitutional. That point was fully considered by the Court, even though it was not made by your counsel: indeed the binding force of the law was conceded by them. They, in terms, admitted the law was constitutional. And it is one of the most remarkable cases of the hallucination which will sometimes come over the mind on certain subjects, that, after what has occurred, you will still insist the law under which you have been convicted is contrary to the Constitution. Let me recall the leading facts of the case. The slave had escaped from Missouri; he was in the custody of an officer, who held him by a warrant from a Commissioner, obtained by the person to whom the service was due, and who was there at the time of the rescue claiming him. You knew all this by express information communicated to you at the time by the judicial officer of the State, who appealed to you in the strongest manner not to attempt a rescue. You chose to disregard all these warnings and, under the dictates of your conscience, as you call it, to <illegible> them at defiance, and to the slave by violence from the hands of the officer of the law
<c02>
The allegation that law of 1850 is unconstitutional is a mere pretext-it is a cover to conceal attack upon the Constitution itself. It is true the Constitution does not use the word slave. It left slavery where it found it, in the States, and when a fugitive escaped from one State to should be surrendered up to claimant, has never been any difference of opinion sensible men who understand the subject, the provision in Constitution which person held to service or labor in one state, under laws thereof, escaping into another,, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from service or labor shall be delivered up on claim of party to such service or labor may be,' included a negro, who, by law, was held as a slave in the State which he escaped. If, then, this be so, and words can be used so as to express a meaning in the, contemplated, an obligation was imposed some- where, and the authority of Congress to inflict a on any one who interfered by violence with right of the claimant thus guaranteed by the constitution, and sought to be enforced under the arrant of a commissioner, is as unquestionable as authority to inflict a penalty for stealing a letter from the mail, or for a violation of the revenue law. admit the clause in question was intended to a slave, and the conclusion is as irresistible as any one drawn from a problem mathematics. it had such a meaning, all contemporaneous, history demonstrates. He who doubts on this point profoundly ignorant on the subject, and it is folly him to discuss it. It was, then, an under the Constitution-this interference by force the right of a claimant-for which Congress could impose a penalty. But it is said that lave ought to have a trial by jury in the State to h he has escaped. That was a matter for Congress to determine. If a person an offence against the laws of a State, and escape into another, has no trial by jury in the to which he has fled. But when an individual is tried anywhere in the United States, for interfering by force with the right of the claimant of' alleged slave, then he is tried by a jury. Then it be established to the satisfaction of a jury he fugitive was a slave; that the person whom you rescued was held to service or labor by the laws of Missouri, and thus was within the very words of the Constitution, was not by your counsel in this case. 
There is no possible in this case. It does not raise any of the questions which can be under the law of 1850. It is simply whether can by statute punish any one who resists an act which the Constitution commands to be done. All these attacks upon that portion of the law of 1850 which conies up in this case, are really intended an impeachment of the clause in the itself. The law is referred to because men have not the courage to denounce the Constitution directly. But in fact it would be much more to throw away all d, and assail the Constitution at once. There may some objectionable features in the of 1850, but they do not come in question here. If the law of 1850 was not in existence, still, under the Constitution and laws in full force before 1850, what you have done was a violation of your duty as a citizen. It is absurd to that it belonged to the States, under the clause of the Constitution referred to, to surrender up the fugitive through express legislation, and if no legislation took place, that the citizen could interfere by violence to prevent the surrender. The citizen could in that do what the State could not do, even by express law. And now you come before me, and claim that you shall not be punished, because you deem the law unconstitutional. You cannot be allowed to decide that question. It would be an easy way for a person to escape punishment, if such a plea were admitted. Every convicted man. would make it. You have spoken of your children. What if a person should deprive you of one of your children, and upon being called before the Courts of the country to answer for the offence, he should insist that his conscience commanded him to do the and therefore the law must not violate his conscience? How would such a plea be regarded? This may be said to be an extreme case; but it is in this way that we can see clearly the monstrous principle upon which you claim exemption from punishment. This decision is not left to you nor to him. The Courts of the country must determine these questions under the sanctions which rest upon; them. In the innumerable cases which come before them, they cannot allow a man to escape because he has some constitutional objections to the law. Few persons like the law that punishes them. �We can-not deal with the abstract natural rights of man. We, in administering the Constitution and laws of the country, must take him with the limited and qualified rights which they have given him as a member of society. The Constitution and laws which protect you in the custody of your children, and in the right to your farm or property of any kind, also protect the claimant in his right to the surrender of his fugitive slave. If discriminate against slavery, be will in its favor. If you say he has no natural right to his slave, where is your natural right to your children when they are competent to care themselves? The truth is, to yield to such a doctrine as you insist would lead to anarchy, and reduce every government on the face of the earth to chaos. I, as a judge, have to deal with your rights and with those of Phil-lips, the claimant this slave, as citizens and inhabitants of these United States, of you owing allegiance to the Constitution and the laws. Neither of you can declare that you will obey this and disobey that injunction of the Constitution. You are both bound by every injunction, and you as much as he. 
I have said this much because I cannot suffer the document which you have just read, and which contains doctrines so much at war with the true spirit of the Constitution and all sound government, to pass unnoticed by this Court. How long would the union of these States last, if all the citizens of the Northern States should act as you did at Ottawa last October? The clauses in the Constitution upon the subject of slavery are a part of the great compact made our fathers, and so long as it exists, we are bound, as honest men, to live up to it in good faith, whatever may be our own views as to the propriety of their insertion in that instrument. Slavery can never be abolished by your method. It has disappeared from the Northern States under the sanction of law, and not by violence.
If you had consulted the real teachings of that Book to which you have referred, you would have found no authority for your act of violence. 
If you had followed the precepts of that Redeemer whose name you invoke, you would have discovered no warrant for your high-handed proceedings. He did not command his followers to interfere by force with the relation between master and slave, which existed when he lived in the world. Let me assure you, and those who think with you, that if you wish to see slavery cease to exist in our country, you can accomplish the object much more speedily by adopting some of those means which He counselled for the removal of evils among men. Apply those means to evil of slavery, and your efforts will be infinitely more effectual. 
 It is not the wish of the prosecuting officers of, as I am given to understand-it certainly is not mine, that any severe punishment should inflicted. main object was to vindicate the Constitution and laws of the country. That has been done. It has been shown that juries will prove true to the obligations which they take upon themselves-that the laws can be enforced. That having been done, the principal object of the prosecution has been accomplished. The case was an aggravated one, certainly; but notwithstanding that, and the extraordinary character of paper which you have read, I shall not materially deviate from the course I had marked out for myself. I shall not impose upon you a severe penalty.
 The Court then sentenced him to pay a fine of one hundred dollars, and be imprisoned ten days.
 MAD�STARK MAD. The question of the sanity or insanity of Abolitionists is no longer doubtful. They are stark mad! John has been sentenced a Republican Judge to pay a fine for the most flagrant and open violation of a law which even his Republican counsel admitted to be constitutional. No sooner is this sentence passed, than highest judicial and executive officers of the law in our city, and our ministers of gospel, forward to defeat just punishment of the fender, and to throw their entire influence to discredit the law land. John Went worth, Mayor of the city of Chicago, and editor of the leading Republican journal in Northwest, openly throws wide doors of the Mayor's office to receive subscriptions to pay Hossack's fine! These men are mad.-Chicago Times and Herald.

We have devoted a large portion of our present to the case of John Hossack, a noble-hearted citizen of Illinois, who has been fined one hundred dollars and committed to prison for the CRIME of in the rescue of a fugitive slave from the U.S. Deputy Marshal at Ottawa, in October, 1859. Read, first, the extracts made from the so-called of Hon. A. W. Arlington, counsel for the prosecution, which occupy their appropriate depart Turning with disgust from such a loathsome exhibition of depravity, read, next, the dignified, and most eloquent defence of his conduct made y Mr. defence which deserves to be printed in letters of gold, and which will cause the blood of every humane and true friend of freedom to thrill and strongly pulsate in every vein., next, his letter, written in jail, to the citizens f Cook County. To think of such a man being condemned to suffer as a felon, in a professedly Christian, for an act deserving of universal applause! a commentary upon the state of the country!, next, the bold, generous, and outspoken appeals f Hon. John Wentworth, Editor of the Chicago, and Mayor of that city, who deserves the thanks his noble interposition. And, read the remarks of Judge Drummond, in remarks characterized by the sophistry, intolerable cant, and a cold-blooded inhumanity. But what the Judge says of the Constitution, and its construction in regard to slave-, is historical truth. Hence our of he instrument, and consequent repudiation of it. with the banner- No Union with Slaveholders! 
Here is a note from a Chicago correspondent: 
, Oct. 10th, 1860.
FRIEND GARRISON, -While the cannon is sounding the supposed Republican victory in Pennsylvania, in this Republican city of Chicago, in sight of the spot where Lincoln nominated, and in of a Republican sheriff, sentenced by a Republican judge, convicted by a Republican jury, (6 Republicans to,) Joseph Stout and John Hossack lie for the grave of helping a poor man to that all men love freedom, and will enjoy it when possible. 
This anti-slavery stronghold has developed many noble men and women, and our two Chicago prisoners have demonstrated that they not only believe, but the sublime doctrine of doing under others as ye would that they should do unto you. A public meeting will be held to-morrow evening to devise ways and means for their release, for which it is necessary to raise from $1,200 to $1,500. We hope to raise it at that time. No circumstance for a long time has so stirred the feelings of our citizens, for it involves the question whether this State shall become the hunting ground of the kidnapper, where he may hunt down the slave, with the United States officials to bay upon his track. 
Yours, for freedom for all,
J. G. MOTT.
BRILLIANT REPUBLICAN DEMONSTRATION.
On Tuesday evening last, the most brilliant and imposing political demonstration ever witnessed in Boston on any occasion was made by the Republican 'Wide Awakes' of Massachusetts, and other parts of New England, all in full dress, and ten thousand strong by accurate count, including seven hundred horsemen. Nearly every one of this immense number carried a lantern or torch, making a dazzling and display in the aggregate. The streets through which the procession were thronged by spectators as never before, illuminations and fire-works being seen in every direction, and the popular enthusiasm reaching a high point. The time occupied in passing a given point was an hour and a half, at unusually quick pace; and in completing the programme, five hours were required, from 8 in the evening till 1 o'clock in the morning! There were many transparencies, of course-such as, �Free labor and free men all over God's heritage,' 'The Pilgrims did not found an Empire for Slavery,' 'Plymouth Rock the corner-stone of a Free Republic,' �No more Slave Territory,' 'The Election of Lincoln and Hamlin will check the spread of Slavery, Secure to Colored Citizens their full Constitutional Rights, Crush, out Disunion and the Slave Trade, Insure a Ready Obedience to all Just Laws, and Restore to the Government a Respect for Liberty, Justice and Expressions of loyalty to the Constitution and the Union were abundant, though in two thirds of the national territory, the Republican party has neither constitutional protection nor the benefits of the Union, and notwithstanding pro-cession itself, south of Mason and Dixon's line, would have been broken up by mob violence, and its members subjected to lynch law!
As a significant sign of the declining spirit of colorphobia, (which has so long cursed and disgraced us as a people,) it is gratifying to state,-though we wish our colored citizens could take a higher and more uncompromising position,- that in the procession there was a very respectable delegation of colored men, organized as the ' West Boston Wide Awakes,' Capt. Coburn, numbering about two hundred, with a banner presented by the colored ladies of Boston, with the inscription, 'God never made a tyrant or a slave.' Also, a delegation of colored men from Portland, Me., thirty-eight in number, � Blues,' Capt. Henry Daniels, with a banner inscribed, ' Liberty throughout the world,' and a figure of the Goddess of Liberty. 
CORRECTION'A line is missing at the bottom of the first column (Refuge of Oppression) on our first page. The entire sentence should read thus:-�An Abolitionist, like a snake, is perfectly harmless, except about the mouth, and there he is incomparably more poisonous than tooth of serpent or rabid dog.' The 'Hon. A. W. Arrington,' in his 'Argument' in defence of the Fugitive Slave Law, shows himself to be on a level with lowest blackguard, and the most inhuman of his species.
FRATERNITY LECTURE. The third lecture of the course was delivered on Tuesday evening, at Tremont Temple, by Thomas W. Subject-�American Aristocracy.' Notwithstanding the unforeseen junction of the great ' Wide-Awake' Demonstration with the hour of its delivery, the lecture was listened to with great interest satisfaction by a large and highly intelligent audience. The speaker could not have desired a higher compliment.
We have copied from the Ashtabula (Ohio) Sentinel a cogent letter from Parker Pillsbury, with a most evasive sophistical reply to it by Joshua R. Giddings. It challenges attention and remark.

HALF-CENTURY MEETING OF THE FOREIGN MISSIONARY BOARD. 
The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign celebrated, this year, with their meeting, the completion of half-a-century of their labors; and the throng that attended their-days-meeting required opening of four large for its accommodation.
During the past year, in addition to the usual ply of about one thousand dollars a day for their ordinary expenditure, the patrons of the Board had their debt of sixty-six thousand dollars. The managers of the Board naturally felt great anxiety o discover whether this unwonted liberality was likely to diminish their receipts for the coming year, "to require to practise more economy; and he exercises of the meeting were skilfully so directed as to afford an answer to these questions. Three, in the course of the meetings, ventured to utter the word �retrenchment,' and to give some light expression to the feelings of their people, not so much in regard to the tightness with which they been squeezed in the past year, as in view of a annually increasing rate of ordinary expenditure, and the contraction of occasional extraordinary debts. But men of influence in the Board promptly stepped forward with replies to these suggestions, and played so skilfully upon the strings of pious enthusiasm that even the remonstrants felt constrained to yield to the tide, modifying their original expressions of objection, while the mass of the audience enthusiastically echoed the artful appeals made to them, and decidedly encouraged the Board not only to demand more money, but to contract new debts when they felt it to be desirable.
There was circulated among the members of the Board, at this meeting, a pamphlet of twenty pages, entitled-'Abstract of the Annual Report of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.' copy from this an account of a new movement of the Prudential Committee, namely, their discontinuance of the support of the four slaveholding churches that constitute the Cherokee Mission, with their reasons for it. With their decision on this point, the Prudential Committee first state what is not the reason for it, as follows:-
The Committee have arrived at the conclusion, that it is time for the Board to discontinue its among the Cherokees. To prevent all misapprehension, it should be stated at the out-set;-First, that this is not owing to the relations of our work among these Indians to the system of; the mission having formerly assented to the principles embodied in what is generally known as the Goodwater Settlement,' which was approved by the Board at Utica, and the Committee having no evidence that the brethren now constituting the mission have departed, in theory or practice, from those principles. And, secondly, it is due to the missionaries to say further, that the prevailing opinion among them is adverse to the Board's retiring from the Cherokee Nation. This is what should be expected of brethren, devoted to their work, in such circumstances; and it may be hoped some of our various Home Missionary Societies will interpose, to sustain them longer at their stations.
The Committee's statement of what are their for this movement is comprised under three; heads, the of which we quote entire, as follows:-
1.�The Cherokees a Christian people.
This mission is one of the oldest the care of the Board, having been in operation about forty-three years. It has employed 18 clerical missionaries, 29 laymen of different occupations, and 66 assistant missionaries, or 113 in all; and $356,421 have been expended in it from the of the Board.
As the result of these and other kindred efforts, the Cherokees have been elevated from the savage state to their present degree of civilization. Doubt-less, among the ignorant portions of the people there are remains of superstitious notions and habits, greater than are found in older Christian communities; but the people, as a body, give the common proofs of being a Christian people. However low may be the standard of their Christianity, it is their only religion. They are generally, as with us, ranked with or another of the evangelical denominations. And are accessible to Christian preachers, and listen to them with the same deference as do their white brethren in the adjoining States. They it chiefly the eastern section their territory, which borders on the State of Arkansas; extending north and south about one hundred miles, and east and w about seventy-five miles. The Cherokee people are supposed to number about 21,000. Our three missionary brethren residing among them concur in the opinion, that they reckon themselves, and are to be acknowledged, a Christian people. Mr. Torrey says: "Christianity is recognized among them, as much as in any portion of the United States. Their constitution provides, [Art. VI. Sec. 1,] that �no person who denies the being of a God, or a future state of reward and punishment, shall hold any office in the civil department of this nation." Mr. Ranney says: 'The nation, as such, I presume, would claim to be called a Christian nation. Some laws have been passed by the Cherokee Council, which have recognized Christianity as the religion of the nation. This has been done incidentally, rather than directly and positively. I suppose that almost universally they would desire to he called Christians." And Mr.Willey bears a similar testimony: �think," he says,"
that the Cherokees, as a nation, may justly be called a nominally Christian nation. The Constitution of country recognizes the Christian religion, and requires a belief in it by all who hold office under the government. All teachers in the public schools are required by law to have the Bible read in their schools daily; and when they are prepared for it, they are requested to pray daily in their schools."� 
The second of their is a statement of-
'How far the Cherokees have the Gospel Institutions.' The Committee represent that, that territory and population, there are, besides the three white missionaries of the American Board, thirteen other white licensed preachers, and a much larger number of �native pastors and exhorters'; that the church-members of all these are more than three thousand in number; and that of these, the Northern Baptists have the largest number, or about fifteen hundred-the Methodists the next largest-the Southern Baptists the next-and the Moravians about two hundred and fifty. (It must be remembered that all these, both preachers and church-members, excepting, perhaps, the Moravians, are pro-slavery people.) The Committee feel constrained to add-
�Of the actual piety of this large membership, we may not speak confidently. While so have an opportunity to attend only three or four meetings in a year, even though these meetings be protracted, we can hardly look for much religious knowledge, or effective Christian character, especially as the larger portion of the native preachers are said to have but little education.'
This reservation is judicious, since one of the missionaries gives his judgment that though all the population can hear kind of preaching, at least occasionally, from some one of the denominations, yet that only a small proportion have opportunity to regular Sunday preaching of any sort. 
Their third head states the 'Difficulties in the of further operations by the Board.' 
These difficulties are, the expense-which they admit to be very great, compared with the advantage; the circumstances (truly discouraging) that they have no active native preachers-small congregations-very few young persons connected with their churches-a membership which has not materially increased for many scarcely any promise of future a successful competition of other sects-and a jealous feeling against them on the part of the government; and the facts, (equally discouraging,) that while the proportion of people reached by the white missionaries of the Board, who all preach through interpreter,(!)) is comparatively small, it is impossible to procure native pastors for their four small churches, and, even if these could not obtained, the people could not be induced to support them! In explanation of this last significant fact, the Committee add (describing the condition of the people from whom they are withdrawing missionary labor because they already �a Christian people,') Their idea of public money is money paid to them, for their benefit; not by them, for the public good.�
The Prudential Committee proceed to state that the
<c05>>
mission has been discontinued in view of these facts, and reasons, 'and for no other or different reasons� With hardihood, they speak of the result of their missionary labor, (in which the above details of disastrous failure are included,) as work of divine grace, amply rewarding the and expenditures which have been made'; and, their two previous declarations that the mission not discontinued on account of slavery should not sufficiently explicit, they close their of resolution regard to it with the following:� 
'To prevent the possibility of misapprehension, it farther resolved, that the mission is not discontinued because of any unfaithfulness on the part of our brethren in that mission; they having been exemplary, r as is known to the Committee, in the discharge of their missionary duties.
�Exemplary in the discharge of ALL their missionary duties'! 
It is well, in this connection, to look back at what two of these same missionaries (now the heads of the mission) said to the Board, in, in explanation of pro-slavery position, a position which they have ever since retained.
 Extracts from the letter of the Cherokee on slavery, signed by Elizur Butler, Moderator, and S. A. Worcester, Clerk:�
'In regard to the question of rejecting any person from the church simply because he is a slaveholder, we cannot for a u hesitate. For (1) we regard it s certain that the Apostles, are patterns, did slaveholders to the communion of the Church; and we have not yet been to perceive any such between their circumstances and ours as to us in departing from their practice in this respect. And (2) our general rule is to receive all to our communion who give evidence that they love he Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity; and we cannot that many slaveholders do give such evidence. 
'Nor can we even make it a test of piety, or a condition of admission to the privileges of Church, hat a candidate should express a determination not to and die a slaveholder.�- 39th Annual Report, 1848, p. 93.
Occasional exchanges of masters are so inseparable from the existence of slavery, that the churches could not consistently receive slaveholders to their at all, and at the same time forbid all such exchanges. We regard it, therefore, as IMPOSSIBLE TO EXERCISE DISCIPLINE FOR THE BUYING OR SELLING OF, except in flagrant cases of manifest disregard to the welfare of the slave.��p. 94. 
'In regard to the separation of parents and children, we must first remark, that it is one of those things which are not any express INJUNCTION OF SCRIPTURE.'... �It is impossible, in our circumstances, to make it a general rule, that the separation of parents and children, by sale or purchase, hall be regarded as a disciplinable offence.'- pp. 94, 95.
What a mockery is it, after dismissing such men as these with commendation as faithful, and leaving slavery triumphant, not only in the nation but in the mission churches, and thrice declaring that slavery is not the cause of the discontinuance of the mission� to close this Report, as they do, with the ejaculation ��Let us be devoutly thankful for what has been accomplished among the Cherokees, and believe that our labor among them has not been in vain in the Lord.'
In the course of the meetings Rev. Dr. Anderson, the Senior Secretary, repeatedly alluded, with regret, to the absence of 'the venerable Dr. � one of the first missionaries of the Board, who had been expected to appear at this jubilee. This �venerable' person is that Rev. Samuel Nott, of Wareham, who has spent his latter years in the writing and circulation of one of the worst pro-slavery pamphlets that ever been published, namely-�Slavery and the Remedy; or Principles and Suggestions for a Remedial Code.�p. 118: Crocker and Brewster, Boston.' 
So great has been the zeal of ' the venerable Dr. Nott' for slavery�for his �Remedial Code' is a contrivance for the perpetuation of that institution�that he has circulated, by gratuitous distribution, in this country and in England, six editions of this thick pamphlet; the last, published in the present year, containing an addition, entitled-�The Present Crisis: with a Reply and Appeal to European Advisers.'
The Board unanimously voted their acceptance of the Report discontinuing (thus discontinuing) the Cherokee mission; they also voted that action was necessary upon certain resolutions of remonstrance in regard to slavery, laid before them by the General Association of Illinois; and they refused to hear the statements of H. T. Cheever in behalf a resolution against the existing revival of the foreign slave trade. 
These things being so, it is not strange that the Board again entrusted the control of its missionary operations to Dr. South-Side Adams, and his equally pro-slavery associates on the Prudential Committee, who were unanimously re-elected. 
The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions have now recorded the following points as their deliberate position:-
That the slaveholding Cherokee nation is 'a Christian people'! 
That the Cherokee churches, into which slaveholders are received without objection, are Christian churches! That the missionaries who have persistently defended this alliance of the churches with slavery are not only not unfaithful, but 'exemplary in the discharge of all their missionary duties'!
That they will neither remonstrate against nor the domestic slave trade, nor the foreign slave trade, nor even hear remonstrances against them!
Is it not a mockery to call such a body as a Christian association?
Will not truly Christian, both here and in Great Britain, make immediate and conspicuous pro-test against it?�C. K. W.
' THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ABOLITION MOVEMENT. 'This pamphlet of 47 pages forms No. 8 of the New Series of Anti-Slavery Tracts. It is a reprint of anadmirable speech by Wendell Phillips, exposing false philosophy, well as refuting the assertions, of those who oppose the immediate and unconditional abolition of slavery. He takes the ablest specimens of such opposition, English and American, ecclesiastical and secular, and lucidly shows how where they are in the wrong; and he shows the deteriorating influence of entanglement in party politics, which can withhold even men so noble as Charles Sumner and Horace Mann from going a halfway position in favor of liberty; an illustration which, as far as Mr. Sumner is concerned, is sadly corroborated by his letter (in another column) to the Rescue Celebration.'
This tract contains ideas and suggestions most important in the present crisis of our national affairs. It may be found at the Anti-Slavery Office, and should receive immediate and wide circulation.
THE CASE CORRECTLY STATED. 
DEAR MR. GARRISON�I see among the news item in the Liberator of last week, a statement that I was recently fined $25 for contempt of court, for asking to be excused from serving as a juryman, on the ground that I was held to be crazy for advocating the immediate abolition of slavery the dissolution of the Union. It is not much consequence, but I may as well let you know that my joke had a very different ending. The Judge, so far from fining me for a contempt, (which, by the way, he could not have done without exposing himself to ridicule as a very Dogberry,) after listening to a brief exposition of my relations to the government, said I was evidently a conscientious man, well qualified to do justice between parties litigant before him, and therefore insisted on my serving. The cases before the court were all actions for debt, and I very reluctantly took my seat in the box, and aided making up verdict in some five or six of them.
Yours, faithfully.
OLIVER JOHNSON.
New York, Oct. 15, 1860
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND ITS DEFAMERS.
To the Editor of the Ashtabula Sentinel:
A tirade of �glittering generalities'! So was the glorious gospel according to Jefferson. the gospel of Liberty and Independence, designated by Honorable Rufus Choate, at his last public Fourth of July dinner. It might well be the last.
Hon. Thomas R. Nelson, of Tennessee, said:-
'If slaves can be induced to believe in that Giant Humbug, [the Declaration of Independence.] there will be danger that they will rise! All men are not born free and equal. That is a Republican abstraction.'
Stephen Arnold Douglas declares:�
'No man can vindicate the character, the motives, and the conduct of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, except upon the hypothesis that they referred to the white race alone, and not to the African, when they declared all men to have been created free and equal-that they were speaking of British subjects on this continent being equal to British subjects born and residing in Great Britain-that they were entitled to the same inalienable rights, and among them were enumerated life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Declaration of Independence was adopted merely for the purpose of justifying the colonist in the eyes of the civilized world in with drawing their allegiance from the British Crown, and dissolving their connection with the mother country.'
John C. Calhoun said:-
Now sir, I propose to examine this, [doctrine that all are born equal,] and I am not afraid to meet the strong prejudices in its favor. There is not a word of truth in the proposition as commonly understood. All men are born. No, sir, men are not born, infants are born, and they grow up to be men. (Laughter) They are born free and equal. Not so. They are born subject to their parents and guardians, and so they continue till they grow up to be free. May! ask, is not this the language of the Declaration of Independence? No such thing; that Declaration, in more simple terms, says all men are created equal; but this is equally erroneous. According to the Scriptures, only two of the human race were created one man and one woman.'(General laughter all round.)
But these are only the �Testimony of the Rocks,' as the great geologist Miller would say. This is the 'Fossiliferous' Record-the finish and finality of fogyism. So let us deseend to later periods. Republicanism has cursed all these with many a curse.
But Senator Seward told the Democrats and the South, in his great Kansas speech, last winter-
�You accuse the Republican party of ultraism and secret designs. But what are these hidden purposes? You name only one. That one is to introduce negro equality among you. Suppose we had the power to change your social system; what warrant have you for supposing we should carry negro equality among you? We know, and we will show you, if you will only give heed, that what our Northern system of labor works our, wherever it works out anything, is, the equality of white men. Did Washington, Jefferson and Henry, when they implored you to relinquish your system and accept ours, propose to sink you down to the level of the Africans? or was it their desire to exalt all WHITE men to a common political destruction.
So much for Mr. Seward. Abraham Lincoln has lent his voice to the same dismal oratoria in this way. While still intensely asserting that the Declaration of Independence includes the negro, he illustrates himself thus:-
�I will say that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about, in any way, the social and political equality of the white and black races-that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making coters or jurors of negroes 
not of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people. And I will say, in addition to this, that there is a physical difference between the white and black races, which I believe will forever forbid the two living together on social or political equality! And in as much as they cannot so live, while they do remain together, there must be the position of superior and inferior; and I, as much as any man, am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. I will add to this, that I have never seen, to my knowledge a man, woman, or child, who was in favor of producing a perfect equality, social and political, between negroes and white men! I have all the while maintained that in so far as it should be insisted on, that there was an equality between the white and black races that should produce a perfect social and political equality, it was an impossibility.
I have heard Judge Douglas state, two or three times, that, in a speech I made at Springfield Illinois I had, in a very especial manner, complained that the Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott case, had decided that a negro could never be a citizen of the United States. In point of fact, it is untrue. I never have complained, especially of the Dred Scott decision, because it held that a negro could not be a citizen; and the Judge is always wrong when he says I did so complain of it. I have the speech here, and I will thank him, or any of his friends, to show whether I said that a negro should be a citizen, and complained especially of the Dred Scott decision, because it declares he could not be one. I have done no such thing; and Judge Douglas so persistingly insisting that I have done so, has strongly impressed me with the belief a predetermination on his part to misrepresent me.'
The New York Tribune assures us that Mr. Lincoln stands on his past record, and Mr. Summer within a month, has referred us to the famous �Douglas Debates� for his views and opinions.
Mr. Giddings, in his valedictory speech in Congress in January1859, profanes the sacred Declaration the same way. In behalf of his party, he boldly but truly declared:-
�We do not say that the black man is, or shall be the equal of the white man, or that he shall vote of hold office, however just such a position may be.�
Indeed! And why should you say so? Has not your boasted Declaration said already, that the Blackman is equal to the white; But in how many of the Republican States since the party was formed, has it deliberately denied the doctrine, by declaring, with overwhelming majority that the colored man shall not enjoy the right of suffrage?. In several certainty besides Kansas. He shall have no voice in making or executing the laws he is taxed to make and required to obey! But in its national organization the party does not say that the black man shall vote or hold office however just such a position may be or hold office however just such a position may be however just And is the position just Magnanimous party to allow it!
Are such republicans the defenders of the declaration of the independence? then who are its defamers? what better these than the sepulcharal mumblings of choate and calhoun? they are glittering generalities almost without even the merit of the glitter to redeem their inanity.
Let the constitution be distored and prevented as it may nobody need care for the against that comparatively paltry parchment all manner of sin and blasphemy may be forgiven. But this daring, defiant blasphemy against the holy inspiration of the immortal Declaration of Independence how can they be forgiven either in this life or that which is to come?
PARKER PILLSBURY.
Jefferson sept.16.1860.
REPLY OF HON J.R.GIDDINGS.
To the editor of the Ashtabula Sentinel:
I have read Mr. Pillsbury remarks in the Sentinel of the last week in which he douglas with denying the Declaration of Independence and then very correctly charges Messrs. Seward Lincoln and myself with refusing to assert the right of the negro to vote. We hold and he admits that we maintain the right of the negro to live to that liberty which is necessary to sustain and cherish life to attain knowledge and enjoy happiness. These are natural rights given to man by his creator. Their existence is self-evident. No man dares stand up before an audience in our free states and deny them. Yet the Supreme court asserts that black man descendants of the African slaves are property and have no rights that white men are bound to respect. Here is the issue between Republicans and Democrats. 
It is true I have always opposed introducing into the republican platform any doubtful issue

The right of suffrage is not a natural right; God never gave the right of suffrage, or of holding office, to an infant who never dreamed of voting or of holding office. Yet he has given the infant and the female a right to live, and we hang a man for murdering infants or females, precisely as for murdering men. we protect the negro, precisely as we protect our wives, our children, ourselves; for the law of Ohio that protects my life and liberty, protects that of the negro to precisely the same extent.
But Mr. Pillsbury insists that the right of suffrage and of holding office are natural rights, embraced in the Declaration of Independence, which proclaims that all men are equal in the natural rights with which God has endowed them; and he assails Republicans for not agreeing with him.
On this subject, every State acts, and must act, for itself. New England and New York allow the black man to vote. Ohio allows him to vote, if less than half black, while Indiana and Illinois deny him the right of suffrage altogether. Yet the Republicans of all these States agree that life, liberty and happiness are the birthright of every human soul, whether black or white, and they have pledged themselves to God and mankind to protect the black and white men in the enjoyment of these prerogatives of the human soul; and while free citizens of Ohio are kidnapped, carried to Kentucky, and enslaved-while the colored mother, on Ohio's soil, is, by the Federal Government, driven to such agony as to murder her own child, or see it carried to the hell of slavery-while black men are shot down and murdered with impunity before the eyes of our people-Mr. Pillsbury, standing beside their bleeding bodies, turns round, and insists that Republicans shall discuss the right which these men should have had to vote, had they not been murdered.
While we are putting forth all our efforts to consign these murderers and pirates to the gallows, he insists that we shall suspend our purpose; and as he hears the shrieks of thirty thousand human beings, annually consigned to premature graves he calls on us to let the work of death go on, until we settle the vexed question of the negro's right to vote. Every slaveholder and every dough-face joins with him in demanding that we shall say nothing of these barbarous murders, of this heathenish piracy, but direct our attention to the subject of voting and holding office. I will not gratify them. When our acts of Congress shall he so amended as to hang murderers, and to send those who enslave mankind to the penitentiary, we will then discuss the right of negro suffrage, and not till then. J. R. GIDDINGS.

WORCESTER POLITICAL ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION. 
MR. GARRISON-Please find enclosed, letters to the Political Anti-Slavery Convention which should have been sent with the report, and published, but were detained through mistake. 
Yours, truly, WM. A. WILSON.
Worcester, Oct. 11, 1860.
LETTER FROM HON. CHARLES SUMNER.
BOSTON, 9th Sept., 1860.
DEAR SIR-With you I hate, deplore and denounce the Barbarism of Slavery;-believing that the non-entity and impossibility of Sslavery under the Constitution of the United States can be fully seen only when we fully see its Barbarism; so that, in the Constitutional argument against Slavery, the first link is its essential Barbarism, with the recognition of which, no man will be so absurd as to imagine, infer, suppose, conjecture, surmise, fancy, guess or presume that Slavery can have any sanction in words which do not plainly and unequivocally declare it, even if, when thus declared, it were not at once forbidden by the Divine Law, which is above all Human Law. Therefore, in much I agree with you, and wish you God speed.
But I do not agree that the National Government has any power under the Constitution to touch Slavery in the States, any more than it has power to touch the twin Barbarism of Polygamy. Therefore, I cannot join in your special efforts. 
But I rejoice in every honest endeavor to expose the Barbarism which degrades our Republic; and here my gratitude is so strong that my criticism is disarmed, even where I find that my judgment hesitates.
Accept my thanks for the invitation with which you have honored me, and my best wishes for all Constitutional efforts against slavery; and believe me, my dear sir, 
Very faithfully yours, 
CHARLES SUMNER.
A. P. BROWN, Esq.
LETTER FROM REV. HENRY T. CHEEVER.
STEPHEN S. FOSTER:
DEAR SIR-The movement which you have in hand for the organization of a political party on the ground of an anti-slavery interpretation of the U. S. Constitution, and with the avowed purpose of abolishing slavery through such an interpretation of our organic Chatter of Liberty, I regard as the most significant and vital symptom of the times. Indeed, it is but the honest and logical sequence of the anti-slavery argumentation and appeal of the last thirty years.
I do not see how it is possible for real abolitionists, that hold our Constitution as ordained 'to establish justice,' to have their sincerity approved before the country, and yet stand aloof from such a movement. All who hold that our Constitution meant Liberty, and that our Fathers intended, as one of them (Madison) expressly said, 'this Constitution to be the great charter of human liberty to the unborn millions who may enjoy its protection, and who shall never see that such an institution (as property in man) was ever known,' all such must logically, and, it seems to me, practically be with you. 
The time has come for the nation, beginning, of course, with a small but compact party in its own bosom, to eject the insolent squatter, which Madison said he thought it wrong to admit in the Constitution, 'the idea that there can be property in man.' We must get a writ of mandamus, therefore, from the people, to put out the slaveholder, and to put in the slave as a freeman.
This is the abolitionism which you must lay, as the corner-stone of the great political party of freedom, that is yet to wrest our Constitution from the robbers that have sequestrated it.
Holding firmly to these views, and seeing that the Republicans as a party are by no means yet up to them, and I fear not likely to be, (although its noblest men, such as Seward, Sumner, Wilson and Carl Schurz are but little short,) my unqualified cooperation is with you in your proposed organization of such a party, as a chief necessity of the times. But an engagement elsewhere, on the day of your Convention, forbids my attendance. Be so kind, therefore, as to apprise your honored President and the Committee, that they may rely on my steady concurrence in their undertaking.
Yours, &c.,
HENRY T. CHEEVER.

LETTER FROM REV. ELNATHAN DAVIS.
FITCHBURG, Sept. 17, 1860.
A. P. BROWN, Esq.:
DEAR SIR-I thank you for your note of invitation to the Worcester Convention on the 19th and 20th inst. A previous engagement will prevent my attendance, and so I write to express my cordial approval of the movement, and of the end sought to be attained. I believe, after years of investigation, that American slavery is utterly illegal and unconstitutional, and ought to be immediately, unconditionally and universally abolished, by the direct and omnipo-
<c02>
tent intervention of the people of the United States. To a party organized on this basis, and acting honestly and directly for this purpose, I should give my hearty co-operation. 
Yours, very truly,
ELNATHAN DAVIS. 
LETTER FROM HOMER B. SPRAGUE, ESQ.
NEW HAVEN, Sept. 17, 1860.
Mr DEAR SIR: I bid you God speed. Any honest endeavor to hasten the downfall of slavery ought to be judged with the utmost indulgence; and, if the means are justifiable, ought to receive the deep sympathy and hearty cooperation of every friend of humanity. 
I regard it as a striking merit of your proposed party, that it is to be frank, open and consistent; that it is to hang out no false colors; that it shall not seek to smuggle into office men whose views of fundamental questions are secret; that it is to make no compromises with wickedness, sell no principles, and tell no lies. I do not know whether practically I shall be able to work in your ranks. That must depend somewhat upon the platform you lay down, and the plans of action you adopt. But joint or several, I trust we shall all, each in his own way, and following his best light, struggle onward to the common goal.
Do not be discouraged at the numerical insignificance of your party at its origin. The genuine, whole-hearted anti-slavery members of the Republican party are numerically insignificant; but the whole South is afraid of Helper, of Sumner, of Lovejoy, of Giddings. If a political anti-slavery party be the appointed means of destroying the evil, it will not need to gain the control of the National Government, in order to achieve success. Long before that day, the slaveholders, aware of the impending crisis, will have made a virtue of necessity by voluntary emancipation. Let us hope that this may prove to be one of the appointed means in the Providence of God, by which the peaceful abolition of slavery may be effected, and our Southern brethren be spared the horrors of a bloody insurrection.
Yours for the right,
HOMER B. SPRAGUE.

HENRY C. WRIGHT IN ELLSWORTH, ME.
When a community is sufficiently enlightened to tolerate this radical reformer, by listening to a dozen or more lectures, and not only give him good houses and courteous attention, but pay him for telling them of their own crimes and sins, there is certainly some hope of that people.
Mr. Wright has been with us twice before; once in the midst of a revival of religion, which it seems his lectures had something to do in breaking up; but this time there was a complete dearth in religion, and in the place of it, everybody was shouting glory to Lincoln and Hamlin, Douglas and Johnson, Bell and Everett, or a small gloria to Breckinridge and Lane, which, as Henry would say, was quite as sensible as singing praises to the modern Christian's God, i. e., judging them by their acts. Mr. Wright spoke to us on humanity, from first to last, enforcing, with his unanswerable arguments, (because founded on the laws of nature,) his peculiar theory, that the blood of woman is the salvation of the world, not by being shed, but by being purified, in the same manner as you would purify the blood of the animal world below man; which necessarily led to the discussion of the marriage relation as well as slavery, both of body and mind. His texts are peculiarly his own, such as Do thyself no harm'-'Health of body and health of soul is heaven, disease is hell'-'The institution for man, and not man for the institution'-'What a man has a right to do with a license, he has a right to do without a license'; the texts in his lectures with us. I think the last came first; but in the discussion of them, not an institution, religious, moral or political, yea, even social and the family, was omitted, until there was nothing left for an honest man to do but to set up for himself, on his own hook, between himself and his God; which he taught was nothing more nor less than the God which speaks in our own soul; therefore my God will not answer for you, nor yours for me.
It is pretty difficult to get people to set up for themselves, so long as they hire a priest to do their thinking for them, and get somebody to suffer in their stead for crimes of their own committing; but we do pride ourselves in Ellsworth in freedom of thought, which will compare with any other place in New England of like size, notwithstanding our reputation for fanaticism. Here the Congregationalists, Baptists, Methodists, and last, though not least in communicants, the Catholics, have their houses of worship, while Spiritualists and other Come-outers hold their meetings, each for the propagation of his views, unmolested and undisturbed; and that is all that H. C.W. asks, an open field and a free fight; for truth, under such circumstances, must prevail.
One of his lectures was upon the death of my little child. He treated the event in his own peculiar way, saying he had no consolation to offer, only this: You did the best you could.' A kind Providence had no hand in it.
I here send you a notice of the death of my child, which appeared in our paper: it was written previous to the lecture thereon:-
Passed on, in Ellsworth, 19th inst., of dysentery, ALICE MARTINEAU, youngest child of G. W. and Abby Madox, aged one year and sixteen days. 
A floweret from its birth; frail as the summer rose, which made it the more lovely and endearing. The question involuntary arises: Why should the one, whom we seemed to love and cherish more than any other, be the victim, and yield up its life so early? 
The answer to me is plain and unmistakable. Nature's laws are perfect, and cannot be violated with impunity, however ignorantly we may trespass on them. This child had violated the laws of its physical being, through itself or its parents, and, though morally it might be as pure as any angel, yet it could not escape the penalty of violated physical law. The moral cannot save the physical, neither can the physical save the moral; each stands upon its own basis and merits. But, does the child suffer from the sins of the parents? Most certainly. We leave legacies to our children of consumption, cancer, scrofula, neuralgia, rheumatism, and the thousand bilious ills which afflict the poor innocent. Therefore, I see no hand of Providence in the death of my child, more than in its life. Its death teaches me that God's laws are inexorable, and must be obeyed throughout, or the merited rebuke is sure to follow, sooner or later, even to all generations; and this is not only true of physical law, but of the moral or spiritual law of our being. 
If you do not want your offspring diseased in body and mind, then see to it that you are not diseased yourselves; for how can you expect the stream to rise higher than the fountain? If you do not want thieves, liars and murderers for your children, do not nourish and cherish the spirit of those evils in your own soul. So, on the other hand, if you do not want scrofula, etc., do not develop them in your own system, but strive by all means to give to the world a better product in body and mind than you are yourselves. So shall the race improve in all that makes life desirable, until the floweret shall put forth its leaves, branches, flowers and fruit, to bless and comfort humanity; then, having fulfilled the end of its existence, it crumbles back to earth without pain or suffering, and goes up to its place with the blessed applause, 'Well done, good and faithful servant.' But does not the innocent child go to the abode of happiness? Certainly it does-but what has it lost? The great primary school which prepares it for complete service in the cycles of eternity. MADOX.
Mr. Wright has lectured some six or eight times in Washington county, four Sundays in Ellsworth, will speak next Sunday, Oct. 7th, in Bucksport, then one Sunday in Bradley, about twelve miles up the river from Bangor, and once in Bangor, or perhaps nearer Portland. Those who read the Liberator ought to hear him, and doubtless will. Republicans, go and hear him-he thinks Republicanism is a step in advance of Douglasism, or modern Democracy.
Yours, for the world, 
G. W. MADOX.

SLAVEHOLDING BARBARITY.
AN ILLINOISIAN WHIPPED TO DEATH-A GERMAN'S EXPERIENCE IN TEXAS.
Correspondence of the Chicago Press and Tribune.
LE ROY, McLean County, Ill., Sept. 18, 1860.
I am induced by a friend to send you the following account of my recent experience in the Democratic State of Texas. I am a German, and emigrated to this country nearly fourteen years ago. I was naturalized in Texas in 1856. Something over two years ago, I settled at Henderson, Rusk County, Texas, and established myself in the merchant tailoring business. During my residence there, I always behaved myself as a good citizen, and was diligent and attentive to my business. Feeling it to be to my interest to keep on good terms with the people, I was particularly careful not to say anything to any one against slavery. I never uttered one solitary word to any human being while there against the prevailing opinion. I was frequently talked to about slavery, and when pushed about the matter, as I often was, I always evaded the subject in the best way I could.
The first intimation which I ever received that I was in any way obnoxious to the people, originated in this way. A young man from Illinois, by the name of Evans, came to Henderson, and while there was incautious enough to say that he thought free States were preferable to slave States, and that he thought slavery was wrong. These statements, so far as I heard them, he made in the mildest manner, and that only when pressed into the subject by the young men about town. I am satisfied that he never said or thought of saying anything, except when conversation on the subject was forced upon him. I had but a slight acquaintance with the young man, but I told him that he ought not to allow himself to be dragged into talking on the topic. But he was not careful. In December last, this young man was taken out by a mob, without any trial of any kind, and whipped to death! The Henderson New Era, a paper published in Henderson, justified the infamous murder, on the ground that Evans was a common thief, an Abolitionist, &c. I was shown the whip which I was informed had been the instrument of his death. It was covered with blood. I also saw what I was informed was the dead body of Evans, about three-quarters of a mile from town. It was so decayed and swollen that I did not recognize it. The hogs and buzzards were eating it. It had never been buried! This was the first occasion upon which I was even incautious. I had no tie binding me to Evans more than any other human being whom I might casually meet, but I felt so utterly indignant that I boldly and recklessly denounced mob law, and at the same time said that Evans had been a fool for not keeping his mouth closed on the subject of slavery.
I soon learned that I had offended the secret demon of mob law. I might well have known it. Seeing that they would soon be upon me, I armed myself for a desperate resistance. On the morning of the 9th of January, between one and two o'clock, the mob came to murder me. They sent six men to my shop to take me out, but finding me wide awake and fully armed, they skulked away. In the morning, when I went out of my door, I found a rope which, in their flight, the cowards had dropped, with which, I suppose, I was to have been tied. During the day, I denounced the dastardly attempt in vehement language publicly on the street, and defied them to prove that I had ever uttered opinions unfriendly to slavery. A committee of five was appointed, before which I appeared, armed with a dagger, and fortified with the purpose to sell my life dearly, if they should attempt any violence. On the trial they proved nothing at all. The following are copies of the committee's 'two reports':
'In the case of F. Amthor, referred to the undersigned Committee, under charge of uttering Abolition sentiments, we report that the evidence submitted to us is not sufficient to authorize us in regarding him as dangerous to our interest as a slaveholding community.
J. M. DODSON, A. J. SMITH, 
ERASMUS REDWINE, B. T. MCDONOUGH.
January 9th, 1860.' 
'I, Thomas M. Yates, one of the Committee chosen by F. Amthor, desent with the majority, and ask for the said Amthor to leave within three days, agreeable to his own offer. THOMAS M. YATES.'
I had hoped that after the report was made, I should be let alone. The men who made this first report were among the first men of the community, and would doubtless have been glad to have seen me protected. But they were powerless. You may judge of Mr. Yates by the fact that, when in Kentucky, he was foreman of the jury which acquitted Mat. Ward for killing young Butler in Louisville. After the trial, I had intimations that I could rely one that, although acquitted by the Committee, the mob was not done with me. My life being no longer safe, I gave it to be understood that I would leave and go to Cuba. I am satisfied that if I had given it out that I would go North, I never would have got away at all. 
In order that your readers may have a true insight into my condition, I will give one more scene which was to me one full of anxious and thrilling interest. On the night of the 15th of January, 1860, a company of scoundrels, the leading men of which were from Marshall, Texas, held a conference in Henderson, in an old house which had been a law office, at which also a good many planters, living near Henderson, were present. The meeting was held at midnight. Getting wind of the matter, and being satisfied that they had met to consider my case, I determined, if possible, to learn their purpose. I went to the building, crawled under it, and overheard everything. I will not take up space in your columns by retailing all the infamous plans which only cowards could meditate. They paid me some very pretty compliments. They said I was an intelligent, bold, reckless man, and might kill some good citizen, and for this reason I should leave. Not one of them said I had uttered Abolition sentiments. 
Then came up the question about my leaving, and I then learned the good policy of giving it abroad that I should go to Cuba. Some of them said that I ought never to be permitted to leave the country, for I would go North, and do just what I am now doing; that is, to publish their villany to the world. Then came a cool, deliberate proposition to assassinate me. To carry out this design, it was proposed to raise $1,500, to which one of them, a man worth $60,000, proposed to add $1,000, making in all $2,500. On the night of the 16th, I discovered at my door the man, Murphy, who was the chosen murderer, armed with a Sharp's rifle. This was after midnight, between two and three o'clock. Supposing he intended to shoot me through the window, I got out of bed, and with a loaded pistol in my teeth, crawled on my hands and feet to the window with a determination to meet the scoundrel, but he discovered me and fled. On the 18th of January, I left in as private a way as I could. By being driven off in this cowardly manner, I have sustained heavy losses. This is a plain, unvarnished relation of deeds, the infamy of which needs no comment.
A Deputy Marshal of the United States resided in Henderson. I applied to him for protection, and he told me he could do nothing. This is the protection afforded in a free country to an injured citizen by a Democratic Administration.

From the Boston Traveller of October 13th.
RUFFIANLY TREATMENT OF A MASSACHUSETTS MAN IN ALABAMA. 
Mr. William J. Brewster, a young man 28 years of age, born and brought up in Boston, and highly esteemed by all who know him, arrived in this city yesterday morning, after a brief visit to the South, which has been filled up with adventures illustrating the animosity of the people there against Northern men. Mr. Brewster was invited to Alabama by Mr. J. J. Giers, a slaveholder of Valhermoso Springs, to become the principal of a private academy at Marysville, eight miles from the residence of Mr. Giers. He had remained there three weeks, when, having been duly elected principal of the academy, he went to Marysville to enter upon the discharge of his duties. He had been there but one day, when he was surrounded by a mob in the street, and ordered to leave town. 
He expostulated, and wanted to be heard in selfdefence, but was refused. During the time he had been there, he had not lisped a word on the subject of slavery, but the crowd said they wanted no evidence against him, except the knowledge that he hailed from Boston. His trunk was broken open, and in it was found a letter from Charles Sumner, written in 1856, and a copy of the Boston Traveller, containing one of Henry Ward Beecher's sermons, which had, however, no allusion to slavery in it.
These were used as evidence against him, and the excited populace became perfectly furious. They gave him three hours to leave town in. Unable to find a conveyance, he started on foot for Valhermoso Springs, bargaining with a man to convey his trunk there for $1 50. He had proceeded three miles when he was overtaken by three men, who ordered him to take his coat off. Refusing to comply, he was pitched into a pond, and kept there for some time. 
Finally they left him, and he proceeded five miles further to the residence of Mr. Giers. This occurred on Friday week. We understand Mr. Brewster will address the Republicans of South Boston and elsewhere during the coming week.
TREATMENT OF A MASSACHUSETTS MAN IN ALABAMA.-We gave some particulars on Saturday, obtained from William J. Brewster, a Massachusetts man, of the treatmen he received in Alabama, on the occasion
<c04>
of a late visit to that State. The Charleston (S. C.) Courier copies from the Somerville (Alabama) Democrat an account of the outrage, which it introduces with the following suggestions:-
'We have repeatedly urged on our readers, and especially all magistrates and officers, the special importance of enforcing and applying at this time, the laws regulating the oversight of persons unknown or liable to suspicion.
We also take occasion to impress on all interested, the policy and propriety of not effecting or continuing now, any engagements with unknown adventurers and travelling agents, teachers, drummers, &c., from the North, and especially those from the States known to be most deeply implicated in the nefarious designs against the South and the common peace.'
The account of the outrage in the Alabama paper we give entire, as follows:-
An Abolitionist in our Midst.-A young man by the name of William J. Brewster arrived in our town a few days since, and proposed to teach a school here. Mr. Brewster hails from Massachusetts, and was highly recommended as a teacher. He was also recommended to the people of Somerville by J. J. Giers, of Valhermoso Springs, with whom he says he has been corresponding. The following is Mr. Giers's letter to Dr. Gill, of this place:
DR. GILLDear Sir,-This will introduce to you my friend W. J. Brewster, the object of whose visit to your town you will perceive from my friend Ellis's letter. Any favor that it may be in your power to show Mr. Brewster will be thankfully reciprocated by
Yours most respectfully, J. J. GIERS.
Valhermoso, Sept. 15, 1860.
Judge Campbell received a letter on last evening, from Gen. John D. Rather, of Dccatur, in which was enclosed a letter from Charleston. 
We have procured a copy of this letter, and give it in full for the information of readers of the Courier, and as an example of praiseworthy vigilance, which we commend to others: 
CHARLESTON, S. C., Sept. 13, 1860. 
To Col. Rather, Decatur, near Somerville, Ala.: 
DEAR SIR,-Although personally unacquainted with you, we take leave, on a question of grave public import, to communicate certain facts, which, in your discretion, you may use as you think advisable. In the present state of the political world, we hold that Southern men should feel their interests to be identical, (as they are,) and feel bound to do all that fraternal regard dictates for their mutual welfare and protection. 
Yesterday, in conversation with a gentleman who had just arrived in our city, by the steamship South Carolina, from Boston, we accidentally procured the following information:-
Our informant, avowedly 'a Northern man with Southern principles,' related that on the voyage from Boston to Charleston, he had an amusing fellow-passenger, a live Yankee,' &c., &c. In describing the peculiarities and idiosyncracies of this 'fellow-passenger,' our informant lightly touched on the slavery question. We naturally asked if he ('the fellow-passenger') was an Abolitionist. The answer was immediately given in these words:-'Of the worst sort-a regular Garrison, Wendell Phillips man,' also that' he disgusted every one on board, and, if he had not been very sick on the passage, would have been whipped before he reached Charleston.' Upon inquiring where he was staying in Charleston, (for we had heard enough to convince us, and really thought that the sea voyage back to Boston would improve his health,) we were informed that he had taken the train, and was en route for your town; that he is by profession a school-teacher, and was going to Somerville in order to take charge of your village school, under contract. We inquired his name.
Our informant here asked why we wanted to know so much about the man. We stated that we intended to write to some discreet and respectable citizen of Somerville, and through him warn that community of this Wendell Phillips rascal. Our informant, for private reasons, (connected with his Boston home, we suppose,) begged not to be pressed any further on the subject. Knowing that if you were warned of this schoolmaster, and had a list of the passengers by the South Carolina, (which list we enclose,) that you would have no difficulty in identifying the individual, we allowed our informant, the 'Northern man with Southern principles,' to be silent on this point.
Any comments on this subject from us would be impertinent and in bad taste. We write jointly, because both joined the conversation, and were similarly affected by it.
It remains only for us to say that we hold ourselves responsible for any and everything herein contained. Should our apprehensions prove groundless, or should we have been the means of warding off danger from your midst, we, in either event, shall be gratified.
Very respectfully,
CHARLES INGLEBY,
WM. S. McCOY.
The Somerville Democrat proceeds in reporting:-
With these facts before them, the people of Somerville took the case in hand on Friday morning, the 15th. Brewster acknowledged that he was on the steamer Carolina, but denied that he ever uttered Abolition sentiments. On searching his trunk, however, the following letter was found: 
BOSTON, October 20th, 1856.
My DEAR SIR,-I am glad that the friends of Freedom in Middleboro' are about to organize. Let the work go on. Better to fail on our side, than to succeed on the side of Slavery. 
Faithfully yours, CHARLES SUMNER.
Wm. J. Brewster. 
There were also several Abolition papers in his possession, but they were torn and used us wrapping paper. One of the papers contained a sermon of Henry Ward Beecher. Thus, the proof is overwhelming that Brewster is an Abolitionist. He received orders to leave these 'diggings' by 12 o'clock. He is of small stature-his complexion is pale, and he appears to be in bad health. He speaks hesitatingly, is of very good address, and easy to become acquainted withhas auburn hair, and very large eyes. If he should stop on this side of Mason and Dixon's line, we hope he will be assisted on his journey North. 
The people of Somerville should feel grateful to those gentlemen of Charleston, who have given us this timely warning, and may he be the last of his kind who may come to find an abiding place among us.
A CITIZEN OF MAINE WHIPPED IN SOUTH CAROLINA. The Charleston Mercury of the 18th has the following, under the head, 'Served Him Right':-
'A man, named Wm. S. McClure, hailing from the State of Maine, was on Saturday last, by order of the Vigilance Committee, whipped by a negro, at Grahamville, for tampering with slaves in that vicinity. McClure was then placed on the cars of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad, and arrived in the city yesterday, and was given into the charge of the Mayor, who will ship him by the first conveyance to the North.'
AN UNDERGROUND RAILROAD CONDUCTOR IN LIMBO. On Sunday last, a man who gave his name as Philip Coughenour was lodged in the county jail, charged with enticing negroes to run away. He was discovered in a corn-crib belonging to Mrs. Campbell, who resides about six miles from Eudora.-Chicot (Ark.) Press, Oct. 4.
MR. BOOTH AGAIN IN LIMBO.-In August last S. M. Booth was rescued from the Government Bastile in Milwaukee, where he had been maltreated for some months for violating the Fugitive Slave Act. Several attempts have since been made by the U. S. Slave-hounds to re-arrest him, which were baffled by his resolute conduct and the protection afforded by an indignant people. He was, however, seized by a Government official on the night of the 8th, and is again held in custody by the Milwaukee U. S. Marshal. Such persecution of a citizen of Wisconsin is only paralleled by the acts of infamy which cost Francis II. of Naples a throne.-Cleveland Leader.
The ship Castilian, of Newburyport, commanded by Capt. Nehemiah Proctor, of this town, and one of the vessels chartered to convey to Africa the slaves taken into Key West from the slavers captured by our national vessels last spring, has arrived at Cape Mount in 56 days from Key West. We learn that 92 of the negroes died on the passage, from various complaints. She had upwards of 400 on board when she left Key West.-Gloucester Telegraph.
SENTENCES OF SLAVE-TRADERS. The officers of the slave bark Orion were sentenced in Boston, Friday, October 5, for being engaged in the slave trade, by Judge Sprague, in the United States District Court, as follows: Thomas Morgan, part owner of the vessel, and her commander at the time of her capture, was fined $2,000, and to be imprisoned for two years in jail. Byron J. Chamberlain, first mate, was sentenced to imprisonment in jail for two years. William Dunham, second mate, imprisonment for twety-one months in jail.
CHICAGO, Oct. 15.-kidnapping and Murder. Jerry Boyd and wife and daughter were enticed from Galena by kidnappers to a farm in Iowa, during the latter part of September. Jerry Boyd was found murdered near Iowa City on the 8th, probably to enable the kidnappers to obtain possession of the women. The citizens of Galena offer $500 reward for the murderers.

THE TWENTY-SEVENTH 
National Anti-Slavery Anniversary.
When the claim for Universal Liberty was first made in our country, the best part of a life-time ago, the work lay wholly in futurity. The idea and the principles of Human Rights were to be re-planted, the justice and necessity of their cause as against Slavery to be proved, the prevailing apathy to be broken, the public mind to be awakened and enkindled, the insufficiency of a Church and State controlled by Slavery to compass Freedom to be demonstrated, the retrogression of the land towards barbarism under their sway to be made manifest, and freedom of speech, of the press, and of a new specific association to be claimed and exercised as the only sufficient instrumentalities of progress.
This is the initiatory work that has been done, and by it, abundant opportunities of direct action have been rendered practicable. The WORK ITSELF, in a thousand shapes, now lies before us, whose privilege it has been to make ready for it. The despotism is driven into open day. To meet it, requires devotion, industry, and the sacred fire of a true enthusiasm. It requires energy, cooperation, and the discipline of self-control. It requires generous contributions of money. We trust that all these indispensable requisites are now, as ever, ready. 
We earnestly and cordially entreat all who love our native land in sincerity, whether Europeans or Americans, to unite with us more numerously and more generously than ever to meet the demands of a period of crisis unparalleled in the history of our country-new, indeed, in the history of the world. For when before has it ever happened that Freedom has been sought from among a dominant people for a down-trodden one, on so grand a scale as this? We ask aid of Europeans, while we bid them observe that their freedom makes progress only in exact proportion as our slavery is brought into discredit. We ask aid of Americans; for where is the American to whom this Cause of ours is not the supreme interest of the present hour as affording the only hope of Futurity? The work before us is ever that primary one contemplated by no other existing body, political or religious: the work that Church and Government are always tempted by the necessities of their position as such to neglect, adjourn, suppress. And the stronger the desire of their members to promote the cause, the stronger the temptation, being so placed, to temporise and to compromise.
To all these we confidently appeal for aid in the work they can neither do, nor do without.
We cordially invite all who love Liberty the world over, to meet us at the Music Hall, Boston, in the month of January next, in person or by letter, uniting their sympathies and contributions with ours in the great work of the time-the peaceful extinction of American Slavery.

IT IS NOT A DYE!
MRS. S. A. ALLEN'S 
WORLD'S
HAIR RESTORER,
The only preparation that has a 
EUROPEAN REPUTATION.
Warranted not to contain deleterious substances.
This pleasant and valuable preparation has been used
for many years by hundreds of the most distin-
guished and wealthy persons, who have pre-
viously tried all the nostrums of the day 
without success, some even injuring 
their hair and health. This is 
entirely different from 
all others. 
'IS THERE ANY VIRTUE IN 
Mrs. S. A. Allen's Hair Restorative?'
We can answer this question by saying that we have already seen persons who have derived benefit from it. 
'Persons personally known to us have come voluntarily, and told us of good results to either themselves or friends, who have used it before it became known in St. Louis.' St. Louis Presbyterian.
MRS. S. A. ALLEN'S HAIR RESTORATIVE has given universal satisfaction, wherever it has been used. It can be used with perfect safety, and its perfect freeness from all soiling, renders it a very desirable article for the toilet.'
Ch'n Witness and Ch. Advocate, Boston, Mass.
MRS. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RE STORER is worthy of confidence.'
Philadelphia Christian Chronicle.
Incomparably the best preparation we have ever used.' N. Y. Evangelist.
'All are compelled to acknowledge MRS. S. A. ALLEN'S as the Hair Restorer.' N. Y. Independent.
'MRS. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER has taken its place at the head of all articles of the kind.' Michigan Christian Herald.
Dispel all doubts as to its efficacy.'
Knoxville Presbyterian Witness. 
There never has been a prescription or remedy for improving the hair, published in the Advocate, which was so fully endorsed by men of unquestioned standing, as in that of Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S.
Buffalo Christian Advocate
Another objection to dyes is the unlife-like color and appearance they cause the hair to assume, and the only way to have grey hair assume and the only way to have grey hair assume its NATURAL YOUTHFUL COLOR, is to use that which will be effectual and yet not a dye-Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER will do this.' U. S. Journal.
In these times, when every cosmetic is warranted as the greatest discovery of the present day, it is refreshing to come across that which is what it PRETENDS to be. A really excellent article is Mrs. S A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER. As an assistant to nature, it is of great service; and a man by using it often prevents a serious and unnecessary loss of hair. Its properties are perfectly harmless, it being a chemical compound of ingredients calculated to facilitate the natural growth of hair.'
Saturday Evening Gazette, Boston,
Those of our readers whose hair is turning grey or losing its color, and who are opposed to using a dye, will find in Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER a preparation that will speedily change the hair to its natural color, and at the same time render it soft. It is superior to any heretofore produced for restoring and beautifying the hair, POSSESSING. NONE OF THE BURNING QUALITIES OF A DYE.
Philadelphia Mercury.
There is no Hair preparation, we believe, that has acquired more popularity than Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER. Why is this? Simply because it is a preparation of real merit, and has never failed, in a single instance, to produce the good effects ascribed to it on the part of its proprietor. Its sales are constant and most extensive, and we begin to think that it is denominated most appropriately the World's Hair Restorer.' 
Newark Register.
We have reason to be assured that Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER is among the best articles of its kind ever discovered; indeed the wide circulation and immense sales it has achieved, fully demonstrate that its efficacy is generally appreciated.' Rahway Register.
Mrs. S. A. ALLENS WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER. The most successful remedy of the day. We know of instances where its good effects have been remarkable.' Weekly Visitor, Franklin N. Y.
'From individual cases that have come under our own observation, we are satisfied that 'Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER' performs all that it promises, and that instead (as is the case with other restoratives extensively used and highly recommended) of being a useless waste of time and money, it is just what it is represented to be, and will perform all its proprietor engages it to perform. We therefore most cordially commend it to the notice and use of those of our readers who need a remedial agent of this character. 
St. Louis Ledger.
'Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER.-As we were travelling in Massachusetts a short time since, we met a lady whose appearance indicated that she had attained the age of sixty. So we inferred, and but for her beautiful hair, we should have added several years. After some conversation she spoke of her hair, informing us that two years ago, at least one half of it was grey, and that she had feared that before then the whole would have turned or fallen off. But our friend read the papers, and acquainted herself with the various remedies for decaying hair, and at length determined to obtain Mrs. Allen's Restorer. She did so, and applied it according to directions, and before a year had passed, she assured us that she had as luxurious, even and beautiful head of hair, as when she was but sixteen years old. Her statement was confirmed by other members of the family, while we were informed that in the same neighborhood there were other instances where the same happy and signal effect had been produced by applying Mrs. S. A. Allen's World's Hair Restorer.' 
Providence Daily Tribune.
'We are satisfied that the statements made in advertisement of MRS. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER are correct.' Boston Olive Branch. 
'Its remarkable success is satisfactory evidence.'
Norfolk Argus.
'Among the very few preparations that we deem deserving of mention, we are by no means inclined to omit 'Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S HAIR RESTORER.' It has been thoroughly tested, and found to be all its inventor claims for it; and to deny its excellence would be to deny the assertions made in its favor by scores and hundreds of the most respectable persons.' Rahway Advocate and Register.
Mrs. S. A. ALLEN'S WORLD'S AIR RESTORER is the best preparation extant for the various diseases incident to the hair and scalp, and is warranted to restore the hair and whiskers, however grey, to their natural color. It having been before the public for many years, and its efficacy in restoring, invigorating, and beautifying the hair fully established, by hosts of persons throughout the country, has led to the manufacture of many worthless imitations, which have been successfully palmed off in numerous instances, upon the public as genuine.' 
Brooklyn Morning Journal.
'This preparation is superior to any heretofore produced for restoring and beautifying the hair. It possesses none of the burning, cauterizing powers of the old dyes, but gives the hair a healthy, glossy appearance almost instantaneously. The Restorer is easily applied, and will not stain the finest linen. The effect is sure in every instance, if applied according to the directions.' Mercury, Philadelphia. 
'Those unsuccessful with other articles can try this with success.' Boston Transcript. 
It is just what it purports to be.' Cleve. Leader.
We might swell this list, but if not convinced, TRY IT. 
We export these preparations to Europe even, and they are superseding all others there as well as in the United States.

THE MASSACHUSETTS WOMEN.
WHAT THEY THINK OF JOHN BROWN, HIS COADJUTORS AND ENDORSERS.
Daughters of sires who fought and fell 
In every native glen,
Full well we ken the value
Of such heroic men.
And in the coming conflict,
When they march in solid square,
Our hands shall deck their banners-
Our favors they shall wear.
And when, to free each trembling slave,
They have redeemed their vow,
We'll proudly twine the laurel wreath,
To crown the victor's brow.
Or if on Freedom's battle-field
They ever need our aid,
To fight and fall beside them there,
We shall not be afraid.
Oh! the Massachusetts women,
We tell you, are true-blue!
And we'll add, by way of codicil,
Just what we think of you!
If Southern tyrants have a deed
Too slavish and too low
For the meanest soul among them,
We can tell them where to go!
On our Boston Posts and Couriers
Are no such offers lost;
They'll take the job, and find themselves,'
And even pay the cost.'
Then when, like useless lumber,
They are kicked out of the way,
They'll kiss the foot that spurns them,
And for future favors pray!
Oh! from the editorial chair
Could we such vermin brush,
That honest men might sit therein,
Without a crimson flush
Of shame upon their temples,
For their noble craft's disgrace,
Which should ever be a blessing
And an honor to our race!
Lowell. AMELIA.
WOMAN'S RIGHTS.
'What! woman the same rights as man?
'Tis folly to suppose it-
She's been a long time under ban,
And every body knows it!
She's worn of old the iron yoke,
Which man, her master, gave her;
She has no right to have it broke,
No right to public favor!
She has no right to claim a part
In money, wit, or learning;
To men belong the sweets of art
They're so much more discerning!
She has no right to College-halls,
Diplomas and degrees, sir;
No right to settle feuds and brawls,
And pocket legal fees, sir!
She hold an office?-what disgrace!
Besides, 'twould be ' so funny '
To see a woman fill a place
Where she was making money!
Why, pettifoggers then, you know,
Would have to go to work, sir!
And quackies drive and hold the plough,
And dandies shovel dirt, sir!
She has no right to heal the sick,
Or practise the physician-
For such presumption let a kick
Just show her her position!
She has no right to speak in church,
Or any other meeting-
For such a bold, indecent lurch,
She'd merit a sound beating!
She has no right to take a text,
And make a sermon to it-
I heard a clergyman declare
Twas sacrilege to do it!
A woman preach? O, what a sin!
But then she couldn't do it-
Her intellects so very thin,
She never could go through it!
Man has a right to be out late
To any temperance groggy;
His wife's a right for him to wait,
Till he comes home, all foggy!
But she's no right to game and swear, 
No right to be dejected;
She has a right to scanty fare,-
A right to be neglected!
She has a right to stay at home,
All friendless and forsaken;
To work the hours off, one by one,
Or else I'm much mistaken!
Indeed, to think of woman's power,
If man should let her vote, sir!
Why, slavery couldn't live an hour,-
The navy couldn't float, sir!
Poor rummies! how they'd gasp for breath,
And topers all die thirsty!
The grog-shops all be struck with death,-
Ah! sir, she is too trusty!
To me, it really does appear
That nature made a blunder!
It always seems most strangely queer
That ribs were torn asunder,
To make a woman near man's heart-
Why, had a toe been taken,
She better then had known her part,
And never been mistaken! TOPSY.

TRUE LOVELINESS.
She who thinks a noble heart
Better than a noble mien-
Honors virtue more than art,
Though tis less in fashion seen-
Whatsoeer her fortune be,
She's the bride-the wife-for me!
She who deems that inward grace
Far surpasses outward show,
She who values less the face
Than that charm the soul can throw,-
Whatsoe'er her fortune be,
She's the bride-the wife-for me!

THE VILLANY OF SLAVERY.
Unholy thought! on what pretence soe'er
Of right, inherited, or else acquired;
Of loss, or profit, or what plea you name,
To buy and sell, to barter, whip and hold
ln chains, a being of celestial make;
Of kindred form, of kindred faculties,
Of kindred feelings, passions, thoughts, desires;
Born free, and heir of an immortal hope;
Thought villanous, absurd, detestable!
Unworthy to be harbored in a fiend!
And only overreached in wickedness
By that, birth too of earthly liberty,
Which aimed to make a reasonable man
By legislation think, and by the sword
Believe. . . . POLLOK.

THE LIBERATOR
INDIFFERENCE TO POLITICS A FAVORABLE SIGN.
To the philosophic observer, the present state of apathy as to the Presidential question, when compared with former canvassings, will be hailed as a favorable sign. Faint rays of light are finding entrance to our minds, to show us that the prosperity or happiness of a people is not dependent upon the success of politicians, or on the establishment of particular forms of government. As men rise in the scale of intelligence and well-doing, the more capable are they of self-government, and their ability to do without external rules is in the direct ratio of their elevation in this scale. And if we ever rise high enough to understand our capabilities and rights, rulers and the ruled will be known only in the records of the past. Ignorance and despotism, intelligence and self-rule are the outgrowth of unerring law. In well-ordered society, such as the framers of the Constitution contemplated, the people are the rulers, and in the process of building up their industries and establishing their social connections, a system or framework of rules is necessary to perfect mutual intercourse with themselves and neighbors. Rules and regulations are needed to promote and to perpetuate this intercourse, and when the people have once made and recorded these rules through authorized persons who represent them, they want from out their number a body of judicious, practical and common-sense men, whose business it shall be to see that these regulations are enforced, or, in other words, men possessing the necessary mechanical contrivance and ability for detail in keeping this machinery in motion, while the people, who are the sovereign, are engaged in their respective avocations.
The management of this machinery might, for convenience, be called a government, and these servants of the people might, in the language of Burke, be termed the 'mechanical politicians.
Ideas like these, the foreshadowings of a more wholesome condition of mind and philosophic thought, are beginning to arrest people's attention, and the experience of past political history is enforcing upon us many wholesome lessons, not the least of which is, that all power lies in God's unerring truth and justice; and unfaithfulness to these in a nation, equally as with an individual, is political and material as well as spiritual damnation; and no human government, whether created by despots or self-created, can afford us any relief. We must to our own selves be true,' each of us, in our undivided capacity as individuals, or it is beyond the power of the State, or even the best organized Church, to save us from destruction.
If, then, the present confusion of the political elements, together with apathy and indifference as to the results of the coming election, on the part of the people, be signs of the times,' we do well to heed them, for it hopefully provokes the prophecy, that an era of somewhat unwise activity is to be succeeded by a period of reflection-a state of mind which can never forsake us without unmanning us, but the possession of which will teach us, that mere bargaining and trading in human beings, merchandize or politics, are not the exercise of our highest faculties, or worthy the effort of rational men.
Mutual and legitimate intercourse by thought, and by the interchange of products of industry, we must have. The scholar, the artizan, the manufacturer and the agriculturist should be all untrammelled. The currents of all legitimate trade should ever be kept clear, and individuals, unhindered by political or ecclesiastical regulations, should be allowed to develop, as best they may, in relation to themselves and society, as the laws of God prescribe. Any government that can compass this end is the very best for any people, whatever be its name or form.
If the signs of the times have not misled us, shall we be ranked Utopian in our instincts, if we fancy we can discern in the cloud-lands of this bartering and trading age, faint glimpses of a purer light, higher and better conceptions among the thoughtful, of our relations to man and to God? Is the upright and honorable merchant perfectly contented with present methods of doing business? Is the capitalist easy under his investments? Are not business men and financiers fast losing hold of one another's confidence? Is not trade-to be remunerative-driven to the miserable shift of adulterating the very necessaries of life, and of cutting down lawful weight and measure? Are not care, discontent and heart-ache engraven, in unmistakable lines, in the visages of nearly all business men of middle age? But we forbear to ascend farther this hill of difficulty at present. Its pathways are beset with rock and brier. Its bald summit is visible to all.
Now, if these things are facts-and we do not see how they can be disputed-what shall we do about it? Shall we rest content in it as our normal condition, or shall we earnestly set ourselves at work to look the evil in the face with the hope to find the remedy? Turn where you will, throughout all departments of industry, dissatisfaction, lack of confidence between man and man in their commercial dealings, burdensome debts and obligations, and miserable shifts and subterfuges to get a livelihood, present themselves at every turn.
One of the most immediate causes of all this, as we have before intimated, lies in the overstrained competition in trade. If the talent and energy demanded by the soil are determined to forsake a most appropriate sphere, and rush to the city for activity, where they cannot be rightfully or profitably used, then embarrassment and delusion of every kind must inevitably overtake us.
What we most need in this country is not gold or silver or paper money, for these, in a financial sense, are useful only as a sign of value, or facilitators of intercourse and exchange of the products of labor. They are only a simple promise to pay,' and our minds should be disabused of that fatal hallucination that anything in the nature of what we call currency can be anything more than a mere instrument of commerce-a help to aid us in the discharge of our duty to our neighbor. We need, more emphatically than ever, to make an honest and energetic effort to restore that long-lost relation which all correct principles of political economy would seem to establish between all departments of industry.
We repeat, that it is a most auspicious omen in this beautiful country to-day-the richest in natural resources on the face of the earth-that it feels so little dependent for its prosperity on either the forms or successes of government or politics. Of what avail are governments and unbounded resources of soil and mineral, if in our ignorance and folly we are determined to compel Gods bounteous blessings to work our self-destruction? Higher standards of action in our intercourse with one another, nobler aspirations for all life-giving truth, can alone save us as a people, and make us respected by our neighbors and ourselves. W.

WORK TO BE DONE.
MR. GARRISON-Much has been said, but comparatively little done, upon the subject of slavery. It seems to be characteristic of the people of New England to do little, and say a great deal. An old philosopher has said, Better do something, if you do all wrong, than do nothing.' I think the old man was wrong. I think it is better to do nothing than to do wrong, if that could be; but that is impossible. There is no neutral ground. Man will do something; he cannot be inactive. If his heart does not guide him aright, it will surely lead him astray. A man may say, I am neither for nor against slavery'; and perhaps the foolish man really thinks so, but we do not; and any intelligent person knows better. 
Supposing he could stand on neutral ground, the more shame for him; for he ought to investigate the
<c03>
matter, find out which side is right, and act for the right.
There have been great minds in every age, and we have men of mighty intellects and noble hearts today. We have men who possess ten talents,' and have no souls; and we have men (things) that do not possess either.
What is man's mission in this world? Is it to eat, drink, and be merry? Or is it to improve the one talent we may possess, to help lift the world to God and heaven?
There is always work for the willing hand, and today God has a great work for us. In ages past, God said unto men, Go, work in my vineyard.' To-day he makes the same demand. There is work enough. Behold, the harvest is great, but the laborers are few. We do not seem to hear the command; we are asleep, and it may be the eleventh hour. We need not say we are willing to work when we know what to do, for we know what is to be done. We hear the cries of millions of bleeding hearts, Come and help us! Come and set us free!'-but we sit here idle, with our hands folded, saying, Would I had something to do! O, men and women, work now, or God may take the field from you, and give it to others far less capable, but more willing.
There is one great question which we all ought to ask, and to decide in our minds. It is this:-What means shall I use to secure the greatest amount of good? What is the best way for me to go to work in this great cause?'
The Book of books' says-' If a man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally.' This is enough; with such a teacher, we cannot go astray. Then let us begin now, as those who have immortal interests at stake. Something ought to be done has been said long enough. Henceforth, let our motto be, Something shall be done. Let us not act rashly, but firmly and consistently.
Some men seem to think that a man's religion must be sacrificed, if he becomes an anti-slavery man! Religion is all that makes a man. Men have ideas more strange about religion than about anything else in the world. It is of the greatest importance, and all that will ever elevate the soul. We must never expect to convert a man to the right by running down his theory; by saying all manner of hard things against his religion, no matter how ridiculous it may seem to us, or how deep in error the man may be. He cannot see his error by our condemning his ideas of right in a harsh and unchristian manner, and if he could, he would not admit it to one who had so cruelly abused him.
We do not know how much harm we may do others by being thus inconsiderate and unkind. How many converts would a missionary make, if he went to work in the way many of our great men do to make men anti-slavery? They are wrong in this respect. We are to tell men their errors kindly, but firmly; and we are not to give up, even though men will not believe. Some of the noblest hearts the world has ever known have sometimes been in the greatest error.
Let each man look down deep into his own heart, and root out all the bitter weeds of prejudice, envy and unkindness, and plant in a new heart the seeds of charity, brotherly love, and Christian forbearance; and may each one individually and unitedly work for one another and for God!
Worcester, Mass. MARY.

THE JERRY RESCUE' CELEBRATION.
The Anniversary of the 'Jerry Rescue' was celebrated at Syracuse on Monday, the 2d inst. Rev. Beriah Green occupied the chair, and the meetings were addressed by him, by Rev. S. J. May, Frederick Douglass and Professor Thome. An address to the public, written by Rev. S. J. May, was adopted by the Convention.
The resolutions, which were passed unanimously, are as follows:-
Resolved, That the Act which, on this its anniversary day, we celebrate, the Rescue of Jerry, was an emphatic, signal affirmation of the truths of justice and the rights of man, rights so primal, that they derive not their birth from any social arrangement or political compact among men, but inhere and reside originally, by divine ordination, in the human constitution, so substantial, real and inextinguishable, that they cannot be altered or annulled by any enactment, but remain sovereign and sacred, to be honored everywhere, and, in case of attempted violation, to be maintained, as above and before all covenants, statutes and formal constitutions whatsoever.
Resolved, That in spirit and principle, this act was a pointed condemnation of slavery in its every assumption, as a thing essentially absurd, wicked and monstrous-a falsehood, too glaring and malignant to receive a singe moment's assent- a crime, too gross and outrageous to be in any case endured-an atrocity, incapable, through whatever device, of any transformation in character or baptism into respectability, and meriting, at all times and under all circumstances, to be sternly denied, resisted, broken down, and trampled under foot.
Resolved, That in spirit and principle, this act was also a condemnation of all complicity with slavery, all participation, directly or indirectly, in the guilt, and it stands a perpetual admonition and rebuke to all who, however active in executing or loud in applauding the Rescue of Jerry, do yet give their suffrage and support to parties and platforms and candidates that ignore the slave, and stand pledged to the slaveholder for the maintenance to him inviolate of his domestic institution,' and avowedly committed to the shameful work of hunting down and remanding back to the horrors of slavery the flying bondman.
Resolved, That we deeply rejoice in those other Slave Rescues which have in different parts of our country successively followed this of Jerry-the rescue at Milwaukee, at Wellington, and at Troy-and we hold in all honor the brave men and women who have been guilty of these acts of humanity, and hereby tender them our warmest sympathies in all those persecutions and sufferings to which, for this sake, they may be subjected.
Resolved, That we hear with unalloyed satisfaction of the rescue of that faithful rescuer, Shermon M. Booth, from the hands of the United States authorities at Milwaukee, and of the spirit evinced by his fellow-citizens to protect him from official reseizure; and we hereby exhort the people of Wisconsin that they suffer neither him nor his rescuers to be victimized by this conspiratous, slave-hunting government, but that they stand by and for them in every extremity and at all hazards, holding themselves ready, should occasion arise, promptly to rescue them also in turn.
Resolved, That we utterly repudiate and renounce and put under our feet all Fugitive Slave Laws, so called, whether of 93 or of 50, as inherently unjust, inhuman and atrociously wicked, whose mandates it were treason to obey, and loyalty to resist; and we hereby pledge ourselves henceforth steadily to oppose and decisively to thwart all attempted executions of them on this our soil-nay, to exert ourselves unceasingly until they become objects of universal reprobation and abhorrence, to be everywhere indignantly disowned, and in repentance and shame to be instantly wiped from the statute-book of the nation.
Resolved, That the morbid sensitiveness, the apprehension and dread habitually exhibited throughout the South, the paroxysm of fright and terror that seized, at the moment of the appearance of John Brown, with his little band of intrepid rescuers at Harper's Ferry, the acts of ruthless violence, outrage and atrocity that followed each other in quick succession over all those States, and are not yet terminated, attest the felt guilt, the fearful exposures and perils of slavery; and that all the signs in this sky, the real or imagined insurrections, the wild panics and reckless, unbridled excesses of late constantly occurring, portend the swift downfall that awaits and
<c04>
proclaims, in omen not to be mistaken that slavery must be abolished, or the enslaver must perish.
Resolved, That from all considerations, therefore, whether of justice or of expediency, if indeed there were an expediency apart from justice, out of regard to the sacred rights of the slave, and regard to the imperillied condition of the slaveholder, we feel impelled to urge anew and with fresh emphasis, immediate and unconditional emancipation, always a duty, and now become a stern, instant necessity; and we hereby covenant with each other steadfastly to work to this end, seeking its accomplishment by all just methods, without cessation, and without compromise.
The following letter from Hon. CHARLES SUMNER, in response to an invitation to attend the Jerry Rescue Celebration, was read on that occasion:-
BOSTON, Sept. 9th, 1860.
MY DEAR SIR-You know well how much I sympathize with you personally, and also how much I detest the Fugitive Slave Bill, as a flagrant violation of the Constitution, and of the most cherished human rights-as shocking to Christian sentiments, as insulting to humanity, and as impudent in all its pretensions. Of course, I agree with you that such an enactment, having no sanction in the Constitution, in Christianity or in reason, ought not to be allowed to remain on the statute-book; and, meanwhile, I trust that the honorable, freedom-loving, peaceful, good and law-abiding citizens, acting in the name of a violated Constitution, and for the sake of law, will see that this infamous counterfeit is made a dead letter. And I am happy to believe that all this can be accomplished by an aroused Public Opinion, which, without violence of any kind, shall surround every 'person' who treads our soil with all the safeguards of the citizen, and shall teach the slave-hunter, whenever he shows himself, that he must expect from Northern men no sympathy or support in his barbarous pursuit.
At your proposed meeting, which it will not be in my power to attend, I trust that a just hatred of slavery in all its pretensions will be subjected to that temperate judgment which knows how to keep a sacred animosity within the limits of the Constitution and the law.
Accept my thanks for the invitation with which you have honored me, and believe me, with much personal regard and constant sympathy,
Sincerely yours,
CHARLES SUMNER.
Rev. S. J. MAY.
A VALUABLE WORK.
SERMONS AND OTHER DISCOURSES, with brief biographical hints, by Beriah Green (New York: S. W. Green, 18 Jacob street,) are the productions of a strong and zealous spirit, devoted with all his heart, soul, mind, and strength to what he feels to be true and right. The character of Mr. Green as an earnest reformer and independent theologian, is too well known to the world to require any words from us. It is a live book from a live man. We do not think that the brave old lion has pawed himself entirely free of all his original Calvinistic mud; but his head is erect, his heart beats strong for humanity, and his soul is aflame with the electricity of a new age, and the ideas of humanitarian Christianity. Mr. Green's volume will hold an honored place in that swiftly-gathering library of Reform literature in which the principles of the Gospel are fearlessly applied to the customs, institutions, and pursuits of men, cut where or how they may. Ecclesiastically viewed, Mr. Green may be regarded by many of his brethren as a heretic; politically, as a fanatic and disorganizer; socially, as a leveller; but we infer from this volume that he is a manly, brave-hearted Christian, who is not content with crying, Lord, Lord, but is resolved with all his might and main to reduce these glorious truths to practice, and to see how they will work when struck, fast as color to the leaf, through the fabric of society, as well as the individual character.-N. Y. Christian Inquirer.
Fully endorsing the above panegyric upon Mr. Green and his admirable volume, we make the following extracts as samples of the entire work:-
A MEETING-HOLDING ACTIVITY, UNDER THE PRETENCE OF A REGARD FOR HUMAN SALVATION, ACCOMPANIED BY A DISREGARD FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, IS AN ABOMINATION TO JEHOVAH. For,
I. It implies rank absurdity and a flagrant contradiction.-In the constitution of man, the rights of man are involved. The attributes, the powers and capacities here found, are God-given endowments. These gifts imply fearful responsibilities. They are a sacred trust, for which an account must be rendered. All this supposes the right to wield our powers and use our capacities, according to our constitution-firmly to hold and freely to pursue the end of our existence. Whatever interferes with us here, injures us vitally. Health, vigor, useful activity are at once impaired. If our right to be what our Creator designed us to be, and to do what he requires us to do, is invaded, wrong and wretchedness must ensue. And this wretchedness must be deep, and this wrong flagrant, in the same degree as the invasion of such rights is far-reaching, violent and determined. Our salvation, of course, depends upon the full enjoyment of those rights, to which, under God, we are constitutionally and inalienably entitled. These can be ENJOYED only in the free discharge of those duties, which the rights imply. To employ our powers and capacities in a course of law-abiding activity, without let or hindrance, is the right of all rights, to which, both individually and socially, we are entitled. If we are assailed here, whether by inward passion or outward violence, our salvation is put to hazard. If the assault be successful, our very hearts are stabbed. If we are free here-free from the dominance of passion within and without-our own passions and other people's -free to discharge the Heaven-appointed duties, which our rights imply, which correspond with them and grow out of them, then are we among the saved. Then salvation sheds its light and pours its songs around.
The invasion of human rights is an assault upon human salvation. The oppressor is a destroyer. The constitution of man-the powers, prerogatives and prospects of man-his present peace, and his eternal welfare, he sets at naught and tramples under foot. Whatever may be his condition, and whatever his pretensions, this is his work. Whether he devour widows' houses, or defraud the hireling of his wages, or hold in slavery the victims of legalized tyranny, he wages war with human salvation. He interferes with the discharge of Heaven-appointed duties, and does what he can to dry up the fountain of blessedness, which from the heart of these duties sends forth, pure and sparkling, its living waters. His success must be a triumph over human salvation.
To apologize for oppression, under any of its varied forms, is to lend ourselves to the work of human destruction. A professed Christian, a religious teacher, even, may permit errors, rank as dunghill weeds, to take root within him; the condition and the claims of the oppressed he may stupidly refuse to study; the crudest, falsest things he may put forth to stifle whatever of generous indignation or manly effort the ravages of tyranny may have provoked; he may deny to the oppressed their inalienable right to sympathy and assistance in the house of prayer; he may lend himself to revile, and reproach, and traduce the friends of holy Freedom; he may even make his religious profession, or his high station, the occasion and the shield of his neglect of the claims of outraged humanity; but this he cannot do without inflicting deadly blows. He sets himself against that in which salvation consists. He breathes a spirit directly and vitally hostile to human welfare. Just so far as he has influence and power, just so far salvation bleeds and dies.
Now, what is it for such an one to put on the appearance of zeal and activity in the work of soul-saving? He affects to lament the depravity and wretchedness of his fellow-men. With a long face, and in solemn tones, he discourses about their condition and prospects. He calls for special efforts for their benefit. He girds up his loins as if he were a-going to do something. Coadjutors he enlists. And now what a scene of activity opens, upon us! Assemblies are called. Meetings are held. Heaven and earth are invoked. What a stir! What expedients! What an agitation of the surface of the general sentiment! With what pretensions is the ear of simplicity and honesty wounded! Sea, and land are compassed to make proselytes.' And they are made; drawn together, reckoned up and gloried
<c05>
over. Proselytes! To what? To saintship without humanity! To saintship, which refuses to plead the cause of the victims of prejudice and oppression! To saintship, which contributes more than every thing else to the protection and growth of the worst forms of rebellion against God, and injury to man! Alas! what have we here? What? the very same vision as pained the eye of Isaiah, the son of Amos! What absurdities! A cold and cruel disregard of human rights, kindling up without losing a jot of its malignity into a fervent regard for human salvation! Invitations to the weary, on lips laden with apologies for slavery! Such contradictions Jehovah may well be weary of. They are too much for even His patience. Iniquity and a meeting, thus conjoined, must be a trouble to him! Such glaring contradictions-such gross absurdities in his very presence! What else can this be than to make his house a den of thieves?
A meeting-holding activity, accompanied with a disregard for the claims of humanity, we ought to eschew for its hurtfulness, and abhor for its wickedness. Just so far as we give it countenance, we pervert the right ways of the Lord. We subscribe to the glaring lie, that on the ground where humanity withers, religion may flourish; that hearts dead to the claims of man, may be alive to the requisitions of God!
How is it, that we hear of revivals of religion among the monuments of slavery? Of successful evangelists among anti-abolitionists? Of a fervent, zeal with a lax morality? The excitement begins, goes on and ends; the tide rises, swells and ebbs, and leaves worldliness, and respect of persons, and alliance with oppression, and a league with intemperance, and contempt for the poor, and a compromise with popular follies, and party spirit, and sectarian zeal, and a spiteful opposition to all who sigh and cry on account of prevailing abominations-these things, and such as these, in the old church and the new proselytes, it leaves where it found them, unrebuked, unassailed; in full vigor and activity. No direct, earnest, and decisive reformatory efforts are here made, lest the excitement should be reduced! To expose and assail prevailing forms of sin would be prejudicial to the revival; would divert the attention of awakened souls from the one thing needful! And so men are to be reconciled to God with their eye averted from the very point where there rebellion burns the most fiercely! And to be reformed without attention to the particulars where their violations of the law are most flagrant! Theatrical expedients are employed, and a theatrical effect is produced! Realities are exchanged for romance. A great noise is made about iniquity, and repentance, and giving the heart to God, and being engaged in religion: but the sober realities which are involved in sinning and turning to the Lord are avoided, lest revival-sermons should sink into abolition lectures, or temperance addresses, or expositions of the seventh commandment, or commentaries on respect of persons, or charges to the rich to distribute, and to the proud not to be high-minded, or attacks upon the settled order of things, and the established usages of society! And so the revival does up its work without touching the strong-holds in which Satan is intrenched! What objection can he have to such revivals? The more frequent they are, and the longer they continue, the more firmly is his throne established. Men may weep or laugh, be merry or sad, wear long faces or short faces, make long prayers or swear long oaths, go to the church or go to the brothel, profess religion or profess atheism, preach or prate, it is all one to him, while they leave him unmolested, to multiply his murders. They may even hang him in effigy, if they will keep their hands from his person. They may, without offence to him, have as much religion as they please, provided they will keep it in what he calls its place-safely closeted with their Sunday-clothes; apart from the actual relations and ordinary business of life; where it may muse and meditate, sing psalms and pray prayers, without being annoyed by the dust of the market, the din of the exchange, the wrangling and contending by which the ballot-box is beset. His most efficient votaries have a religion of this sort; and can, on suitable occasion, bestir themselves to multiply proselytes. They may be zealous for God at the protracted meeting, provided always that they are zealous for the devil, too, in bargain-making and negro-hating; in clinging to parties pledged to the support of slavery, and in opposing decisive measures to promote the cause of temperance. Whoever combines iniquity with a meeting, may reckon on the countenance and co-operation of the devil.

THE RATIONALE OF TRUE LOVE.
We make the following extract from an excellent little work, entitled Love and Mock Love; or, How to Marry to the End of Conjugal Satisfaction'-by George Stearns, Author of The Mistake of Christendom, &c.; just published by Bela Marsh, 14 Bromfield Street, Boston:-
You have heard it said that Love has no eyes.' This is a mistake. It is Mock Love that is blind, whereas True Love is full of discernment. Nothing is essentially more unlike its counterfeit than Love. This is gentle, that is impetuous; this is constant, that is angling; this is rational, that is capricious. Mock Love is selfish, intriguing, jealous, and sometimes cruel; Love is always generous, frank, confiding and grateful. The former is consistent with the grossest ignorance; for none is so simple as not to be liable to fall into it, and its object is never known; but the latter is possible only with a degree of wisdom, since the object of True Love is Character, and therefore Intelligence is the very medium of its development. It is Conjugal Want discovered by Reason. It springs from no unintelligible affinity,' but from a sagacious sense of subjective worthiness and objective worth. It is more of taste than passion-a providence of the head as well as a preference of the heart. There is not a spark of illusion in it. But Mock Love is nothing but an illusion. No wonder, therefore, that it tends to wretchedness, whereas the fruit of Love is unmingled delight.
To bring to light still more tangible marks of distinction, be it observed that marriage is an institution of human nature; that is, every man naturally wants a wife, and every woman naturally wants a husband-an abiding correlative companion. But no woman can be a real wife to an unreal husband, neither can any man be a real husband to an unreal wife. Therefore Natural Marriage is the life-union of one man with one woman who are personally correlative. Such a match is not likely to be accidental. Reason is the only guide to it, and when once made, nothing but death can unmake it. Thus Conjugal Love is the bond of Natural Marriage. But this True Love must have a parentage-how is it born? As the heart is its natural mother, so the head is its natural father. For-
I. There can be no Conjugal Love between mutual strangers. No man can love a woman whom he has never seen nor heard of; and no woman can love a man that she knows nothing about. We may love all the attributes of a worthy character without loving any person, until we know to whom they belong. We may seem to love one whom we only imagine to be worthy; but in truth we love solely our ideal-not the person that is, but a creature of fancy. Therefore it is impossible to love truly, that is, with rational as well as affectional delight, any person with whom we are not acquainted.
II. None but the loving can be truly loved, and none but the loved can love truly. For everybody loves to be loved, and nobody can love to be unloved. Some care more about being loved than others. Every one delights in being loved just in proportion to one's ardor in loving. We are more concerned for the love of friends than of strangers. Most of all we prize the Love of one who has become the special object of our Love. I may love all the attributes of a woman whom I know, except that she does not choose me for the companion of her heart; and this alone prevents my conjugal love of her. Why? Because the subject of Love is happy only in happifying its object-because Love is an unselfish giver, seeking not its own delight, but finding it in what it seeks for another. Without her love, my companionship would be disagreeable to her, and a sense of this would render hers disagreeable to me. This is as much as to say that mutual love is the only real Love.
III. Correlative Character is the basis, and mutual acquaintance the birth of Conjugal Love. For loving is no more a voluntary act than being loved. The affections of heart and soul are as spontaneous as any sense of pain or pleasure. One loves another, therefore, as passively as water runs down hill. The truth is, the lover is affected to pleasure by the loved, and this affection results from matching attributes of character. The incentive to Love is both subjective and objective. Nature's husband and wife are personal counterparts. Each is what the other wants-the antitype of their individual receptivity; and the mutual discovery of this fact gives
<c06>
birth to Conjugal Love. The candidates for a normal marriage are thus espoused by nature; but each has to be informed of this correlation, and the twain are married by interchange of the transpired intelligence.
This is the only rationale of happy marriages. It is Nature's formulary. All other alliances which pass for marriage are unnatural, spurious and unsatisfying. All marriages which precede acquaintance are likely to be of the latter sort, being prompted not by Conjugal Love, but by an abnormal, illusive impulse yet to be explained. But before coming to that, let me say expressly that there is no evil in Love. LOVE IS ESSENTIALLY HOLY, and not merely harmless in its influence, but auspicious in all its ways, and invariably happifying. True Love inspires no jealousies, perpetrates no murders, suggests no suicides, induces no mismarriages, creates no family jars, and warrants no selfish lusts. All these mischiefs, and more, have been imputed to Love, but ignorantly so. I tell you it is Mock Love that has damaged Love's blessed name.
It is not enough for our safety, however, but only a step toward it, to know that such a circumventive principle exits, without an ability to detect its presence and evade its evil workings. This is attainable only as we penetrate its essence, and comprehend, so as to guard against, its development. It becomes, therefore, a paramount desideratum to ascertain precisely in what this Mock Love consists; and to this point I say at once, though the statement will require to be amplified and explained, it is merely the PANTHEISM OF LOVE'S PRETENSIONS.

SERMONS AND OTHER DISCOURSES.
WITH BRIEF BIOGRAPHICAL HINTS. BY BERIAH GREEN. Pages 556 12mo. With Portrait engraved by Ritchie.
In spite of the modest, and to most readers, perhaps, unpromising title of this volume, it will be found to bear the impress of a vigorous and original mind, and to contain a fund of earnest thought, profound feeling, and eloquent expression. The topics mostly relate to the great practical interests of life, the application of the highest principle to daily affairs, and the influence of Christianity on politics, business, education, and the general relations of society. With a strong faith in the vitality of justice, Mr. Green contends strenuously against every form of oppression, insisting on the exact adjustment of social duties by the standard of ideal right. His powerful reasoning is always accompanied with novel and suggestive illustrations, showing no less felicity of statement than sincerity of conviction. No one can peruse the volume without respecting the zeal and integrity of the author, and receiving a new impression of the worth of the principles to which his labors have been devoted.-N.Y. Tribune, 29th Sept.
'One thought pervades throughout-that of the absolute supremacy, the all-sovereign authority of the Throne of the Eternal, of great Truth and Justice. They are the life of the world, the soul and substance of whatever has vitality, worth, permanence among men. Here are wisdom and strength, the secret spring of all accomplishment and success. Fidelity is achievement, and unfaithfulness is failure and defeat. The ideal is the standard, to which everything must be carefully adjusted. All usages and institutions are tried in this light, and each to be accepted as good and worthy only as it may conform to and symbolize the inner Verities. There is warm appreciation of heroism in life, and especially high adoration of Jesus as the Hero of all heroes, realization utmost of the perfections of wisdom, virtue, and nobleness in history. And there is correspondingly deep disgust and abhorrence of all baseness. He has indignant loathing and abomination for those wretched idols before whom the multitudes bow down and worship those cunning, soulless quacks <illegible> jugglers who, vaulting up perpetually into the high places of society, busy themselves but to bewitch and bewilder, to befool and destroy.'-Review in National A.S. Standard, Sept. 22d.

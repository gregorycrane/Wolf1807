ABOLITION BOOKS.
MR. EDITOR.-Your readers may remember that, some months ago, I called their attention to the abolition sentiments contained in a school edition of Cowper's Poems-a book which is used in the schools and colleges of the South. I now desire to bring to their notice another and a more dangerous book, because it is a religious one, called Malcom's Bible Dictionary. It is used more or less extensively in all of our Sabbath Schools, because of its freedom from sectarianism.
On page 246 of this book, after giving an explanation of the word 'servant,' the author proceeds to say,-
'Domestic slavery, as it exists in the United States, is contrary to the entire spirit of the New Testament, and every good citizen, should be anxious for its speedy extinction.'
That is not only the rankest kind of abolitionism, but, as will be seen by reference to the book, the sentence is entirely gratuitous, as it is not at all necessary to an understanding of the author's explanation of the word 'servant.'
I offer no comment upon it, but simply call the attention of parents and Sabbath School teachers to it. I would remark, however, that it is the height of inconsistency for us to threaten to dissolve the Union to preserve our institutions, when we place in the hands of our children religious books which teach them that the very institution for which we propose to fight is wrong, and contrary to the teachings of the Bible. B.
JEFFERSON AN IGNORAMUS.
At the Southern Commercial Convention, held in Montgomery, Ala., in May, 1858, there was a speech by the prince of fire-eaters, W. L. Yancey, in which the following passage occurred:-
'If it were not for the names of Madison, Randolph, Mason and others, whose names have been quoted in order to frown down the presumption of a young man at this day for pretending to understand this subject, I would even now throw the lance of debate to any gentleman to stand up here, and maintain that these laws were constitutional per se. I would to God every countryman of mine was disposed to judge of the issues between the North and South for himself, that the opinions of old fogydom could be utterly wiped out..... Will my friend (Mr. Pryor) now say that Mr. Jefferson, in his political ethics on slavery, was right? He cannot say so. Mr. Jefferson thought it would weaken the South, and therefore he was for the entire prohibition of the slave-trade. The distinguished, venerable, practical, and philosophical gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Ruffin) knows that Mr. Jefferson was wrong, in his ideas about slavery. I need not expatiate on that subject, because it is a matter of history known to everybody. If that was the fact, there was among the framers of the Constitution, who were true to us in all the interests of the white man, a sentiment in relation to slavery that is not entertained now.
Mr. Pryor-That is true.
Mr. Yancey-That is all I ask. Then I say that he old fogies of that day entertained opinions in relation to slavery which we of this day are unanimously agreed were not sound..... If I could get this body to divest themselves of the shackles that Madison, Jefferson, and Mason have thrown about them, concerning slavery, and could get them to understand that South Carolina is against any, even the most limited prohibition of the slave-trade, I should not fear their unbiased judgment.'

A JAIL BANNER.
A Charleston paper of the 23d says:-
Mr. John T. Milligan, the District Jailer, will unfurl to-day a very fit banner for the place and occasion. It consists of a white field, seven by five feet square, with a perpendicular line of division drawn through the centre. On the section furthest from the building is a large star, with a circle in the centre. Within this circle is a Palmetto tree, over which is the word 'Secession.' On each side are two blue stars, and beneath, the words 'All Aboard.' Above this star, on the right, is a Crescent, on the left of which is written, 'Resistance to Tyrants is obedience to God.'
The section nearest the jail represents Abe Lincoln, manacled, being borne by two huge Africans, on a rail, each negro having a firebrand in one hand, while the other supports the rail. Opposite this is a policeman directing him to the jail, pointing thence with his club. Beside the policeman are the words, 'Rail-Splitter Wanted.' On the ground beneath Old Abe is a log, maul, and axe, which he was in the act of availing himself of when he was taken up by the darkies. The stanza above this,
'Old Abe in company is found,
Which justifies his being bound;
And so in chains, astride a rail,
He's borne triumphantly to-the White House,'
completes the picture.

NORTHERN SPIRIT OF FANATICISM.
Extract from the recent message of the Governor of North Carolina to the Legislature of that State:-
The forbearance with which the South has borne these indignities and wrongs, has utterly failed to secure a corresponding forbearance upon the part of our aggressors. The spirit of fanaticism by which they are influenced, growing bolder by its lawless riot and unobstructed indulgence, has, at last, so far united the Northern masses as to enable them to seize upon the General Government, with all its power of purse and sword. Two persons have been elected, respectively, to the offices of President and Vice President, exclusively by the people of one section of the country, upon a principle hostile to the institutions and domestic policy of the other. Neither of them received an electoral vote in all the fifteen Southern States, and neither could have uttered, in many of them, the political sentiments upon which they are elevated to power, without subjecting himself to the penalties of the local criminal laws. A clearer case of a foreign domination as to us could not well be presented; and that it will be a hostile domination, past occurrences and the circumstances under which they have been elected, forbid us to doubt. That any people, having a due appreciation of the principles of liberty could long submit to such a domination, it is impossible to suppose.
It is true, Abraham Lincoln is elected President according to the forms of the Constitution; it is equally true, that George the Third was the rightful occupant of the British Throne, yet our fathers submitted not to his authority. They rebelled, not against the man because of any defect of his title to the crown, but against the more substantial fact-the tyranny of his Ministers and Parliament. That power 'behind the throne,' and which in the name of the throne attempted to deprive them of their
<c02>
liberties, is the one with which they grappled. So it is with us. It is not the man, Abraham Lincoln, that we regard, but the power that elevated him to office, and which will naturally maintain a controlling influence in his Administration. And can it reasonably be expected, that men who have totally disregarded their constitutional obligations, and proved so dangerous in the administration of their State governments, will learn moderation by this new gratification of their lust of power and domination?
When it is considered that the sentiment of hostility to African slavery is deeply fixed in the minds of the Northern people-that for twenty-five years it has formed a part of their education-been inculcated in the family circle, and taught to them from the pulpit, as a leading principle of their religion, together with the duty of its practical enforcement 'everywhere and or every occasion,' it must be confessed that there exists but little ground upon which to rest a hope that our rights will be secured to us by the General Government administered at their hands.
This condition of public affairs, as was to have been expected, threatens the most deplorable consequences to the Confederacy. Already it is rendered more than probable that several of the Southern States, in the exercise of the natural rights of nations, will separate from the Federal Union, before the termination of your present session. Such an occurrence would present a grave state of facts, commanding your most serious and solemn deliberations.
In view of the perilous condition of the country, it is in my opinion becoming and proper that we should have consultation with those States identified with us in interest, and in the wrongs we have suffered; and especially those lying immediately adjacent to us. From a calm and deliberate consideration of the best mode of avoiding a common danger, much good might result, and no evil could.
I therefore respectfully recommend, that you invite the Southern States to a conference, or such of them as may be inclined to enter into consultation with us upon the present condition of the country. Should such a conference be found impracticable, then I would recommend the sending of one or more delegates to our neighboring States with the view of securing concert of action.
I also think that the public safety requires a recurrence to our own people for an expression of their opinion. The will of the people once expressed, will be a law of action with all, and secure that unanimity so necessary in an emergency like the present.
I therefore recommend that a Convention of the people of the State be called, to assemble immediately after the proposed consultation with other Southern States shall have terminated.
The subject of our military defences will require your early attention. I would recommend a thorough re-organization of the militia, and the enrollment of all persons between the ages of 18 and 45 years. With such a regulation, our muster roll would contain near a hundred and ten thousand men.
I would also recommend the formation of a corps of ten thousand volunteers, with an organization separate from the main body of the militia, and that they be suitably armed and equipped.

GOV. MOORE TO THE BAPTIST CONVENTION.
Some days ago, we published the resolutions adopted by the Baptist Convention of Alabama, and transmitted to Gov. Moore. The following is his letter acknowledging the receipt of these:-
EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, Nov. 16, 1860.
REV. I. T. TICHENOR-Dear Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the declarations adopted by the Baptist State Convention of Alabama.
I fully agree with the Convention in the opinion that 'from the administration of the Federal Government, (Lincoln's,) as things are-with reference to our peculiar property recognized by the Constitution-we can no longer hope for justice, protection, or safety.'
I thank the Convention in my own name, and in the name of the great and sovereign State of Alabama, for the patriotic sentiments contained in their proceedings, and for the appropriate, dignified and Christian-like manner in which they are expressed. Such noble sentiments, emanating unanimously from an assemblage of Christian men, will carry with them a moral force and power that will do much good in Alabama, in her present emergency, and will serve to convince the Abolitionists that the same causes which dissolved the union of the two Churches, North, and South, will have a similar effect upon the Union of States.
With great respect, your obedient servant,
A. B. MOORE.

SOUTH CAROLINA BAPTISTS.
The 'Savannah River Baptist Convention' unanimously passed the following resolutions:-
Whereas, The sectional feeling which lately split in twain the bonds that united us with the North in Christian communion, was a sure indication that those who could not live together as a Church could scarcely continue in political union; and whereas, the late election of a sectional President, upon the same principles that divided the Church, makes us a distinct and separate people; and whereas, our beloved State has called a Convention of the people, to consummate, by constitutional form, the disunion which has virtually separated the peoples of the North and the peoples of the South; therefore, 
Resolved, That it is our duty, as Christian gentlemen and patriots, to sustain our beloved State, at all hazards, in the maintenance of her sovereignty, and in the protection of her constitutional rights and liberty.
Resolved, That in making this declaration, we speak only for ourselves, and trust in the good God to give us strength, courage, and endurance to maintain the right.

THE COURSE TO BE PURSUED.
In view of the pressing nature of our public affairs, it appears to us that a course may be indicated which would go far to allay the exciting causes of disunion. We will venture to suggest it. The chief cause of offence, alleged wherever the people of the South undertake to specify their grievances, is the Personal Liberty Act on the statute books of various Northern States. We need only refer to that of Massachusetts. It is admitted on all hands (!!) to be unconstitutional. Unquestionably our Supreme Court would unanimously so adjudge it, if applied to for the purpose. Three or four years since, one of its present justices, Judge Chapman, upon being appointed a Commissioner under the provisions of that Act, declined the position, and gave the public his reasons in full for so doing, and pointed out with much particularity the conflict of the Act with the Constitution of the United States.
If the repeal of this Act, therefore, inoperative as it is in fact, except as a source of dangerous irrita-
<c03>
tion, would prove a check to those events fatal to the welfare of the country, so evidently intended by many, at least of the Southern States-is not the exigency sufficient to demand the promptest action? There can be no hesitation about it. Certain of the Southern Conventions are to be held very shortly, before the regular session of our own Legislature. Why wait for that? If the exigency is such as seems only too evident to all judicious minds, then the greatest of all national calamities-yes, the direst which has ever been recorded in the history of the civilized world-could be stayed at least, and the whole difficulty be placed in the way of adjustment, by that prompt action on our part which is demanded by every principle of justice (!!) and every motive of patriotism. (!!) Our present Chief Magistrate is about to leave the Commonwealth for new scenes and labors. What more signal service could he render to the State and to the country, than by calling together the Legislature, simply for the consideration of this subject, (!!) and under the influence of the strong public sentiment already aroused, (!!) propose to them the removal of this blot (!!) upon our legislation, itself the main cause of all our national troubles? (!!) Surely, no honor, (!!) likely to be won by any man in our day, could surpass that of him, who should be the means of bringing to an end a quarrel, which must excite the amazement of the world, (!!) and which, if pursued to its end, could expose us only to universal derision and contempt. (!!)-Boston Courier.

BEECHER'S IN DIFFERENCE.
The Rev. Henry Ward Beecher reminds us more of the celebrated Dick Swiveller, than of any historical characters whom we can now call to mind. His eloquence is of the order commonly called rigmarole, and its substance is made up of a material denominated flummery. Unhappily there are multitudes who are captivated by rigmarole and who love flummery, and thus they crowd in to hear him discourse. The secret of the entertainment afforded by Mr. Beecher is in his abandoning the path of common sense and reason, and giving loose to imaginations among the clouds. As a mere entertainment, this might do well enough, if he did not undertake to apply his speculations to practical affairs of life-and above all, to the great concerns of government and religion. No wise man would follow his teachings-the unwise are misled by them into courses of thought and action extremely injurious to themselves and others. They who follow him will be sure to find it in the end only
'A wild dedication of themselves
To unpathed waters, undreamed shores, most certain
To miseries enough.'There is no doubt he has done and is doing great mischief among the inconsiderate. With this class, his harum-scarum style of thinking and speaking is attractive. But when such feather-brained orators as Mr. Beecher and Mr. James Freeman Clarke discourse to a miscellaneous assemblage, in the style they do, about so serious a matter as the secession and separation of States-it is time, indeed, for all soberer men to come to their senses, and ask to what all this is leading, and what means can be used to counteract the influence of such poisonous stuff. If men of this reckless and ill-judging stamp are to have the free control of public sentiment, we shall be at loggerheads in this country, in sad earnest, very soon indeed. Mr. Beecher replies to his own question, 'Do you think the South will secede? My answer is, I don't believe they will, and I don't care if they do!' The brains of Mr. Beecher and of multitudes like him are addled by a barren victory, of which the fruits, whether sweet or bitter, are yet to be realized-by somebody. But if Mr. Beecher does not care for the secession of the South, we can tell him, in all soberness, that there are at least 1,600,000 men in the free States who do care a great deal-and that the majority against them in those States is comparatively insignificant. He should also be informed that before any such secession can be accomplished, much is to be thought and much done by men of a very different order from himself-and that, if it comes to the last resort, it will be a very different contest from one between those who sometimes do mischief by votes and brawling-and that then we doubt very much if Mr. Beecher's tone will be found so confident, or the spirit of himself and those in concert with him quite so much of the dare-devil description as at present. The majority of men in this country, he may rely upon it, will take great pains and brave great perils to save the Union.-Boston Courier.
JOHN BROWN MEETING AT THE TEMPLE.
The 'young men' who propose to hold a meeting at the Tremont Temple, on Monday, the anniversary of the death of John Brown, under the auspices of James Redpath, to continue, as they say, John Brown's life, 'by striving to accomplish what he has left them to finish,' are making a severe test of the forbearance of this community. We do not believe the great body of the Republican party of Boston, or Massachusetts, will sanction this proceeding at this time, and we hope they will do themselves the justice to endeavor to persuade James Redpath and his abettors to abandon their purpose, and not assemble at the place, nor for the object proposed. The community is now suffering under great pecuniary distress, aggravated by grave political trouble. To augment the principal cause of this distress and trouble through a public meeting, held principally at the instance of James Red-path-an Englishman-not a citizen of the United States-recently from Hayti-and but a temporary sojourner here-a man whose association with the difficulties in Kansas and John Brown has rendered his name obnoxious to very many peace-loving people-is an experiment, we trust, a due consideration of the subject by C. W. Eldridge and his associates who unite to call the meeting, will prevent being made-and which, as we have already said, we fervently beseech the responsible and respectable members of the Republican party to lend their influence to avert. However, should the meeting take place, we hope no one who does not sanction its design will attend it, or in any manner attempt to interrupt its proceedings-if the thing be persisted in, let those who disapprove of it trust to the good sense and correct judgment of worthy citizens for its rebuke and condemnation; to use violence-to trespass upon the rights of those who may convene at the Temple on Monday-would be committing a wrong-morally and legally-as offensive as any wrong that conservative men would condemn. A violent and riotous manifestation of opposition to the assemblage in question would give Redpath and his co-workers the notoriety they seek, and tend to excite for them a sympathy that would enable them to produce still greater mischief. Therefore, if the more judicious men of the Republican party, and a due consideration of the tendency of such a convention by all well disposed people, be not sufficient to prevent the opening of the Tremont Temple to Redpath, let him and his followers take their way unmolested, so long as they do not transcend the limits of the law, and those who are opposed to them keep out of their company.-Boston Post.

SELECTIONS.
HENRY WARD BEECHER ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION.
At the close of his brilliant Fraternity Lecture on 'Young America,' at the Tremont Temple in Boston last week, Henry Ward Beecher said:-
Here ends my lecture-but not my address. (Applause.) There is almost but one question. It is no longer the weather, or the health of the family, or prosperity, that men question when meeting each other in the car or on the street; it is, 'Do you think the South will secede?' My answer is-'I don't believe they will; and I don't care if they do!' (Loud and prolonged applause.) When I say that I don't care if they do, I mean that there is no terror, in so far as our own prosperity is concerned. If you ask me whether, for their sakes, I do not care, I should modify my answer and say, 'For their sakes, I trust a better mind may be given them, and that they will remain in the ship;' for they are like Paul's men of whom he said, 'Except these abide in the ship, they shall not be saved.' (Laughter and applause.) If they left the ship, they would swamp, and there are too many of them to be lost; and I really do not think they are in a fit state of mind to die. (Laughter.) But in so far as the free States are concerned, I hold that it will be an advantage for the South to go off. I cannot reckon myself among those who have advocated disunion, either for policy or from principle. I never have gone, I cannot go, with them; and therefore I hold it to be the duty of every patriotic man to resist it by all proper methods, in a spirit of kindness and honor. But if, against our honest endeavor and full intent, this does take place, in the providence of God, then, I say, let us appoint a day of thanksgiving. (Loud applause.) We have never been advantaged, nor do I see any near prospect of our being advantaged by remaining in their company. If we are to join the old ascetics, if to wear a shirt of hair-cloth for the mortification of the flesh be good, if it be good for our souls to be kept in a perpetual turmoil and fret and rub, then we will continue to wear a hair shirt. But if quiet and liberty be prosperity, I hold that we shall be better off without these uneasy neighbors than with them. And I therefore say, it is not for our sakes that we hesitate. I would not have that impression go to the South. I would not have Carolina think that there will be a tear shed if she goes. I would not have any of the Gulf States think that we are unwilling to part company with them. We are willing to keep company with them so long as is necessary to maintain pact, honor, citizenship and true love for the whole country. But if, against this spirit, they insist on going apart, let them understand distinctly that we count it their loss, and our gain. (Applause.)
The time has come when the public mind must take some position and make some expression. I, for one, do not believe in Union for the sake of it. I saw upon some of the meagre banners carried about in the late conflict this poor-house inscription-'Union for the sake of the Union.' When this Union was founded, it was an alabaster box, made for precious ointment, and that ointment was Justice, Humanity, Liberty, Rectitude; and so long as these precious qualities are in it, I love it, for their sakes. But when the alabaster box has emptied out the ointment, I do not care what hand breaks the box-it is good for nothing after the ointment is gone. The idea of maintaining union for the beggarly sake of union! Union for honor, union for truth, union for vigor in liberty, union for power in free institutions, union for humanity now, and greater growth-for that I would sacrifice almost anything in life. But union without liberty, union without humanity, is but the corpse of my friend, and not his living and soul-inspired body. Bury the corpse when the soul has gone out of it! Don't keep it to stink above ground! (Applause.)
Nor do I believe in union for any purpose of intimidation. For thirty years past, those States have elected themselves mallets with which perpetually to threaten to strike, or strike, the North. I think it is high time that this part of patriotism should be done away with; that the North should let the South understand that they are neither to be bullied nor intimidated. Already we hear of new compromises. Already it has pleased the South to say, that if we will repeal our Personal Liberty Bill, they will be gracious to us, and take us into favor once more! It is suggested that we go into a retinkering of the Missouri Compromise line. The Missouri Compromise line is very much in the condition of the Atlantic Cable. Let him find it who can. It is cracked in a hundred places, and will never carry messages more. You will never get the Missouri Compromise again, and never ought to. It was a wickedness when first made. We received it as a legacy, and our fathers having been sworn to keep it, we were willing, I was willing, to abide by that part of the compact. It if fresh in your memories how that compact, although made in the interest of the South, was ruthlessly violated. It is in every memory, too, how, immediately sequent upon that, the Free State element in Kansas was treated by the South. With what supreme impudence does the South now, immediately after the election,-the North having been scrupulous in her fidelity to every obligation,-propose new compromises! New compromises! After having, for thirty years, tyrannized in this land,-for thirty years shown the morals of slavery in her statesmen and men in office at Washington,-having bludgeoned our citizens,-having, with violence, opposed the pistol and the knife to reasons and arguments,-having gone where she would, and when she would, and done as she would,-by constitutional measures, we have limited her power.
My friends, this is a triumph of ideas that has taken place. Government is but the exponent of new thoughts and new principles. Now, when, in the changes of Providence, we have come to that point in which there is to be a government that shall be administered according to the old original principles of liberty that belong to this country, the South declare revolution, and say that they will not endure it. For one, I will give the South everything that we covenanted when we made the Constitution. I will stand by the original compact. They shall have their institutions, unvexed by any political intrusion. Gen. Cushing (whom I have not the honor, personally, of knowing) says that we must give up free thinking! In a speech just made by him at New bury port, which I hope is not correctly reported-but I fear it is-(laughter)-is this paragraph, which I think, as a curiosity, ought to be preserved; it will rank with those creatures we dig up, fossils before the deluge. (Laughter and applause.)
'By the Constitution, the Federal Government is but the trustee of the States for purposes <illegible> and prescribed; the Southern States have no right to undertake to convert the North to their ideas of local interest, and the Northern States have no right to undertake to convert the South to their ideas of local interest; the attempt to do this, on either side, is contrary to the Constitution and subversive of the Union;
<c05>
and the organization of the personal Administration of the Federal Government on such premises would be itself the overthrow of the Constitution.'
You observe how exactly he has limited and defined his own opinions. He does not say that we have no right to interfere with them by legislation or by commercial restrictions-in which there might be some truth-but he says that we have no right to endeavor to convert them to our ideas. He says, to the South:-'If you think, you have no right to speak to the North;' and he says to the North:-If you think, you have no right to speak to the South.' That is a very unequal requisition. The brains and intelligence of the South are not the strongest part of them. (Laughter.) In the North, reasoning is greatly in vogue. To put an embargo on both sides chiefly oppresses them. But in old Massachusetts, and at this day, a public man, not unversed in history, and certainly not unversed in the knowledge of our ideas and institutions, declares that it is the part of treason for us to reason on the matter of human rights in the South! It is only saying in a diplomatic way:-'Hold your tongues, both of you, and let the nation go as it pleases!' Now, I hold that this can never be. Free speech cannot be suppressed in the North; soon it will not be suppressed in the South.
The question next comes up, suppose the South should secede, what would be the result? I do not know-so far as they are concerned. So far as we are concerned, I do know. In the gale on Lake Erie this week, there came a ship, and many of Boston's solid men, perhaps, had an interest in her, for she was loaded with copper ore. To relieve the vessel, they threw over the copper, and every ton that went down, the ship went up, and they saved themselves by throwing over the copper ore. For every State you throw off, you will go up an inch! (Loud applause.) What have they contributed to your welfare? I saw the statement in a Southern paper, that they had spent sixty millions of dollars in the North. I had never been aware that they did it for our good. I supposed they wanted their fevered lips to kiss the North pole, and that they came for their own convenience and pleasure; it seems that they came for our benefit! I think, if they came for luxury, they will come again; and if they do not, I think we shall contrive to live a little longer.
But, it is said, they won't sell us their cotton. What will they do with it? They sell as much to Great Britain now as she wants. Will they eat it? Will they cease raising it? 'They won't trade with us, some say. Have they been trading with us for our benefit or for their own? If interest was a necessity in days past, it will be in the future. Interest never runs mad and cuts capers, as Carolina does. It does not get the blood in its head. Interest follows certain great laws of trade. If there ever was a people that would try to break its commercial relations with another country, it was these colonies, after they broke away from Great Britain. She was our enemy, while France was our friend, and had rendered us essential aid. Yet the laws of commerce sent us to Bristol and Liverpool and London, not to Paris. And so, if they secede, the laws of commerce will take no notice of their flurry. They will not trade in New Orleans, or Savannah, or Charleston, any more than now; they will trade in New York, Philadelphia and Boston; for these laws of commerce are things that do not let men meddle with them. They control men, and are not controlled by them, and will continue to do so.
And as for them, my friends, the South are in no state to be stable. Do you suppose that these men who are so quarrelsome, and fighting against this Union, are going to be lambs, when they are among themselves! As long as they have lambs and sheep to devour, they will be wolves and lions against the flock; but when there is no flock to devour, they will be lions and wolves among themselves, and devour each-other. They are not of the right temper. Freedom of speech is a thing that is lost there. Freedom of the press is not thought of there. There are no such ideas of liberty and government in the South as we have in the North. They are not fit to control themselves in a state of independent government.
That is not all. Our thunder storms are in the air above our heads; their thunder storms are under their feet, and the dark cloud, surcharged with the divine vengeance, makes the ground heave at every step. Now,-and I cannot deny it,-it is the conservative moral and political power of the Northern States, that holds in check that terrific element. Let them stand by themselves, and servile insurrections and war are just as certain, it seems to me, as explosions are, where fire comes to gunpowder.
And that is not all. There is a white squall more dangerous than the black squall. The oligarchical few of the South are abhorred at home by the free white people. It has been their policy to raise up issues as between the whole community and outside communities, in order to keep the people united at home, and maintain the control of the aristocracy over the masses. Only separate them, and not five years will pass before the free white element and the ruling element will be quarrelling, and will have their hands upon each other's throats. If they depart now like the prodigal, they will by and by come back like him, very ragged and very humble, and very willing to get in as a servant, in their father's house. (Applause.) I would not have this. I would, by all honest and true measures, by a spirit of undaunted firmness, by speaking plain words to plain men-I would have all done that can be-done to prevent this folly. If you stand shivering in your shoes, and undertake to give up, for the sake of the Union, you will only prompt to new aggressions in the time to come. (Loud applause.) There is but one way, and that is, to stand where our fathers stood, in their spirit, as Christian freemen, saying, Our country, our whole country, our country undivided, if it may be held together by the cohesion of justice and truth, humanity and liberty; but if the whole may not be had in that spirit, then so much as can, bold to the original and revolutionary principles; let them stand together, and theirs be the glory, and theirs be the safety.
So much for patriotism. (Prolonged applause.)
From the Cincinnati' World We Live In.'
THE FUTURE OF POLITICS.
The result of the elections clearly indicates that Abraham Lincoln is to be the next President of the United States. The control of the General Government of this country, with all its varied interests, is to pass forever out of the hands of the Democratic party.
This is an event of great significance in the history of our country. Nor need pro-slavery men imagine that the victory now gained is a transient one-that in 1864 they will come back again into power, and reinstate the Government on its former basis of friendliness of slavery. The extremists, in favor of slavery, have met with a Waterloo defeat that is to last for all time to come. No party that is any more pro-slavery than the Republican party can ever again win political power.
The principal danger that the Republican party will have to encounter, after it has gained control of the Government, is not pro-slavery opposition, but its taking upon itself an extra-conservative
<c06>
character, whereby it will become the protector and bulwark of slavery in the States where it now exists. This would tend to create another party in the North, that will take an advance step of the Republicans, in favor of freedom, and which party would eventually become the largest of all others in opposition to the new Administration. Proslavery men at the South will probably abandon all expectation of carrying slavery into the Territories, and will content themselves by striving to maintain the continuance of the institution where it now exists.
The extremists of the South may even give up contending that slavery is a great good-they will, very possibly, admit it to be an evil-though a necessary one. In other words, they will rally to the support of conservative Republican principles, and oppose the doctrines of the progressive Republican party-that is to be.
But revolutions never go backward. And if Mr. Lincoln's Administration leans, as it probably will, southward, and if it becomes ambitious to the considered very conservative, in place of progressive, the result will be that the Republican party will gain the South, but it will ultimately lose the North. It will simply follow in the footsteps of the Democratic, party, and go down, sooner or later, as the latter has done.
Lasting success, for any cause, can be secured only by a full and complete recognition of the eternal principles of RIGHT. The enslavement of one part of the human race, by another part, is wrong; and being wrong, it is bound to come to an end. Every effort to prop the institution up-to prolong its existence into the future-will be in vain. Slavery being in direct antagonism to the spirit of Republican institutions, is doomed to die out-it cannot live.
Such being the case, the acme of statesmanship in this country is at once to grapple the question, how shall emancipation be brought about? Any attempt on the part of our public men to ignore, or get around, this one great leading question of the age, in regard to a fixed fact in the future, betrays a lamentable absence of those essential qualities which go to make-up the true statesman.
From the Boston Journal.
GEN. CUSHING'S ADVICE.
A Washington correspondent of a Philadelphia paper, who is, we believe, a South Carolinian by early residence, if not by birth, says, with respect to the present Southern excitement,-
'The true policy is to allow this passion to burn itself out, as it must do if left alone. If well disposed people will not furnish the fuel, the heat and the blaze will gradually subside and diminish. Both have been kept alive by the contributions of professional Union-savers, who, after exciting the South with the most scandalous misrepresentations concerning the Northern opposition, are now volunteering their insidious and gratuitous services to mend the mischief for which they are mainly responsible.'
This was undoubtedly intended as a general remark; but it hits one man with terrible precision-we mean our own Caleb Cushing. He made a speech in Tremont Temple in the course of the Presidential campaign, and we leave it to our readers of the following extract, (which, by the way, we cut from a South Carolina paper, thus showing that the missile had reached its intended mark,) if he did not therein 'excite the South with the most scandalous misrepresentations concerning the Northern opposition':-
'Therefore, I say, the real issue before the country is of the continued existence of slave labor within the States. All the conspicuous current party issues, and especially the several Territorial questions, are but the timid touches of men at a great thing, which they have not the manliness boldly to grasp and handle. And the Republican party has been conceived, born and nurtured into strength in order, if possible, to force or seduce the Federal Government into Abolitionism, or else the Republican party is a monstrous and ridiculous abortion, a gigantic falsehood, swindle and fraud. And I re-assert, confidently, if Mr. Lincoln is elected, the Republicans will have to burst up at once, or to attack the domestic rights of the States.
What, then, will people of the Southern States, attacked in their constitutional rights, their domestic peace, their property and their persons, do? What will they do? Will they passively submit to be the conquered subjects of New England? No! I do not hope or fear, believe or doubt, what they will do-I know; they will defend themselves to the utmost, first with constitutional means, and then, if necessary, with extra constitutional means; in fine, with all the means of defence which God and nature have committed to them.'
Now it is this man, who, having thus inflicted upon the Republican party his measureless abuse, flatters himself that he is the fittest person in the Commonwealth to favor that party with his gratuitous advice. And yet, on his own showing, he is somewhat premature, because we have not yet had a chance to realize the inevitable alternative to which he consigned us, viz: 'to attack the domestic rights of the States,' or 'to burst up at once.' Until the former contingency becomes imminent, we furnish Mr. Cushing with no new topic for his ponderous rebuke and advice, while just so long as that contingency is delayed, we are, according to him, 'bursting up' without his intervention.
But we suppose that it is not for the benefit of the Republican party that Gen. Cushing delivers either his before or his after election speeches. That party is but the frame against which he fixes his lurid fire-works, for the enjoyment of others at a distance, and for his own profit. He must accept that course, or none at all-for the Republican party and the vast majority of the people of Massachusetts cannot possibly, as things stand, have any faith in Gen. Cushing. That is the fact, whether it be lamentable, remediable, or quite unimportant. Nevertheless, he is heard and read with temporary interest, as his fulminations pass on down South, where they strike, if at all. And if they do strike there-if they make any impression at all upon the public mind-can any man, looking at the above extract, say that they are not thoroughly mischievous and bad? They are grossly incorrect-that is obvious-and that incorrectness is just of the kind which is most calculated to inflame sectional misunderstanding and animosities. The only question now is, can Gen. Cushing repair the evils of his Tremont Temple speech?
The above article appeared in the morning edition of the Journal-and in its evening edition of the same day appeared the following editorial paragraph-thus ludicrously illustrating the whiffing character of that paper:-
MR. CUSHING'S SPEECH. We commence the publication of the speech of Hen. Caleb Cushing, being the part delivered at Newburyport last evening. The remainder of the speech will be delivered this evening, and will appear in our columns to-morrow. The views of a man of so much eminence as Gen. Cushing, on the great issues now exciting the American people, will be read with no little interest. None can question his ability, or
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
The United States Constitution is 'a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell.'
The free States are the guardians and essential supports of slavery. We are the jailers and constables of the institution.... There is some excess for communities, when, under a generous impulse, they espouse the cause of the oppressed in other States, and by force restore their rights; but they are without excuse in aiding other States in binding on men an unrighteous yoke. On this subject, OUR FATHERS, IN FRAMING THE CONSTITUTION, SWERVED FROM THE RIGHT. We their children, at the end of half a century, see the path of duty more clearly than they, and must walk in it. To this point the public mind has long been tending, and the time has come for looking at it fully, dispassionately, and with manly and Christian resolution....No blessing of the Union can be a compensation for taking part in the enslaving of our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to be perpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that it can only continue through our participation in wrong doing. To this conviction the free States are tending.'

fail to feel the power with which he handles any question of moment. This last speech has all the General's intellectual characteristics, as well as his political peculiarities. We need hardly say that we deem it almost entirely untenable in its rehearsal of accusations against the Republican party. But no matter for that-the Republicans can afford to let Gen. Cushing take his own method of presenting his views, which they will carefully and honestly weigh. They welcome light from every quarter, and will endeavor to meet the exigencies of the times with all the patriotism which Gen. Gushing could wish, and we believe with more candor than he evinces.
Here is the succeeding commentary of this in-and-out, for-and-against, neither -here�nor-there, doubled-and-twisted Boston Journal:-
ENOUGH OF CUSHING. Mr. Cushing continued his address at Newburyport on Saturday evening, and it is still �to be continued.' When this harangue will be terminated, nobody seems to know. But if, as we have supposed, the object of Mr. Cushing in giving his remarks to the public by piece-meal in the manner of the sensation story writers, is to make a more profound impression, he has overshot the mark. The public interest did not survive the publication of the first two installments of his speech, and having got an inkling of its tone, spirit and general purport, there are few, we venture to say, who have followed  Mr. Cushing to the present point, and still fewer will continue along with him until his words have run out.

From the Salem Register.
CALEB CUSHING-NOW, AND THEN.
Gen. Cushing has sounded his trumpet once more, and blown his secession blast The first part was delivered in Newburyport on Monday evening the last is yet to come. As has been usual with him of late years, and as was expected, he puts the North wholly in the wrong, and considers Massachusetts as a sinner of the deepest dye. It is sufficient to characterize the speech, to say of it that it might safely have been uttered in the very sink of treason, Charleston itself where traitorous men have trampled under foot the flag of the Union; where members of Congress do not hesitate to cry, �down with the accursed Union;' and where a vessel owned in part by this same Caleb Cushing-and report, of which we have seen no denial, has said, by his own telegraphic order-has pulled down the stars and stripes, and run up the Palmetto flag� for which act of devotion to sectionalism the ladies of Charleston are preparing a testimonial to the Northern man with South Carolina principles. 
The whole tenor of this speech seems to us atrocious-monstrously wicked, as tending to add fuel to the flame among the misguided and deluded secessionists and we defy any one with a drop of Massachusetts blood in his veins to read it without a thrill of honest indignation for this perversion of the sentiments and purposes of the people of the North, and sovereign contempt for the man who could thus degrade his talents, and belie the promptings of his early manhood. But he has run his head against an �IDEA,' and bids fair to dash his brains out. 
Gen. Cushing says it was left to degenerate sons of the fathers to begin to undo the great work, which they had not wisdom to comprehend or virtue to maintain  in its pristine integrity and strength; and he charges that in twenty years after the establishment of the Constitution, men of the Northern Stales began to strike blows at the equality of the States-that they next abandoned or perverted the Constitution by assuming to confiscate the property and other domestic rights of citizens of the South, sojourning or in transit at the North-and so he goes on to the end of the chapter, in a style which makes the enquiry pertinent, or at least suggests the thought, whether Gen. Cushing has any idea of offering his services to the secessionists as a military leader, to marshal their Minute Men against the people of the Free States who have wronged the South so foully as he alleges. 
Gen. Cushing also pounces upon Senator Wilson, and pretends not to know what he means by the �Slave power.� Perhaps the redoubtable General may take a hint from DANIEL WEBSTER'S speech, in which he said: �In my judgment, we are to use the first, and the last, and every occasion which occurs, in maintaining our sentiments against the extension of the SLAVE POWER'-and as a' political question,' too, 'for statesmen to discuss, and entertain, and act upon.' Or from the old Whig resolutions, which made frequent mention of the �tyranny and usurpation of the SLAVE POWER,' and the ' destruction of the unjust influence of the SLAVE POWER'-and find a more charitable interpretation than he professes to give to the phrase. 
But these desultory remarks are merely intended as preliminary to calling attention to some of Mr. Cushing's former sentiments, so that the public may judge whether or not he is absolved from the guilt which he so freely charges upon others. He thunders about the sins of the North, and flippantly says-' as if so petty a question as the serf-labor of the South were the sum of the Universe of the providence of Almighty God!' Let us see what even Caleb Cushing once thought about this �petty question'-for it is much pleasanter to turn over the pages of his old record than to peruse the new. 
It so happens that while the nullification fever was at its height, or had just passed its climax, in 1833, CALEB CHUSING delivered the Fourth of July Oration before the Massachusetts Colonization Society in Boston, and his very first sentence was:-
'Liberty,-liberty of thought, liberty of speech, liberty of action,-liberty in government, liberty in person,-is the master principle, the predominant idea, the great first motive passion, which, in all times, but most of all in our own has impelled and agitated the world. Whether in savage or civilized existence, it is alike the cherished desire of the human heart, the potent spring of human life. It is the one over swaying sentiment, which God implanted in his breast: it inspires him with untutored eloquence in council, it nerves his arm in battle.'
He said that, being assembled in the name and in the holy cause of Liberty, 'fitly, therefore, upon this proud anniversary, since the day of our emancipation from bondage as a people should be consecrated to the one high principle, which singles it out from its undistinguished fellows in the lapse of time-the conservation of the genuine theory of universal justice-the spreading abroad of the great truth that all men are born to equal participation in the blessings of life-THE RIGHTS AND WRONGS OF THE SLAVE, WHEREVER HE MAY BE AND OF WHATEVER CLIME OR COMPLEXION-the cause, in a word, of constitutional Liberty.' He proceeds to say:-
�we, indeed, in the land of the pilgrim fathers, the chosen refuge of the oppressed, inhale the pure atmosphere of freedom; we imbibe its doctrines with the very being we draw from the material breast; they come to be the first elements of our moral constitution in manhood; and for us, it is only the abuses of liberty from within, that we have reason to apprehend in our New England.   And would to heaven that it were so in our whole country; that the curse of involuntary servitude did not still cling to so large a portion of our countrymen destroying their peace, filling their dwellings with the agonies of perpetual domestic suspicion, subjecting their families to massacre, and hanging its dead weight upon their public welfare; that the chains of the Negro were at length and forever struck from his limbs; that Liberty, Knowledge, and Christianity, were made equally the unpurchased birthright of the European and the African, throughout the New World! Glorious, in truth, and auspicious, will be the day-glorious for our country, auspicious for the human race-when man shall cease to be the bond-slave of man. 
It matters not what name of sect we of New England may bear-in what form of association, what combination of party, we may be ranked-on this point we are of universal accord; and we are so-not merely from that innate conviction, that prejudice of education, if you will, which has grown with our growth-but on considerations of eternal troth, of justice, of humanity, of religion, of expediency-of everything which should inform the heart and control the actions of a rational and accountable man�of a patriot, a philosopher, and a Christian. 
We maintain, and the letter of our Constitution is to us a truth, that men are born to equal political rights, however the accidents of fortune may interpose to prevent the enjoyment of those rights; and that personal servitude, therefore, is contrary to the fundamental principles of political justice.
<c02>
We believe that, although the Bible inculcates legal obedience of the subject to the ruler, and of the servant to the master, yet political equality, civil freedom and personal freedom, and of course the doctrines of emancipation, are among the peculiar and characteristic lessons of the religion of Jesus Christ.'
O that Caleb Cushing were as he once was!  O that he could drink of the fabled fountain of Youth, and be himself again-a true son of Massachusetts and of New England! 
One more extract must not be omitted, as illustrative of Mr. Cushing's New England sentiments a quarter of a century ago, viz.:-
'We are deeply sensible of the pernicious influence of slavery upon the condition of that portion of our country where it exists, and the character of its free inhabitants. We see that it tends to weaken the spirit of enterprise, and to banish industry by rendering labor disreputable; that it corrupts the morals by promoting idleness and affording facilities for vicious indulgence; and that, striking as these evils are, they are poorly compensated by the livelier sense of the value of freedom and higher tone of honor, which may prevail in a slaveholding community. We see, among the States of the Union, some, which nature has most bounteously favored, comparatively impoverished by the system of slave labor,-rendered tributary to the industrious population of the free States, or of foreign countries, for all the comforts and conveniences of life,-unblessed by the signs of universal competency, happiness, and welfare, the commodious habitations, the thrifty and well ordered farms, the flourishing manufactories, the ships, the churches, the schools, which are the result and the honor of free labor in the Eastern and Middle States;-we see all this, the retribution  which slavery works out upon itself, we see that monstrous disloyalty towards the Union, in certain regions of the South, of which, whatever may be the pretexts, THIS UNDOUBTEDLY IS NOT THE LEAST FRUITFUL SOURCE; and in these considerations, even if the right of the slave did not cry to heaven for his ransom, we should find incentives enough to plead, and labor, and pray for the purification of this plague-spot from our land, for the end of this great drawback in the palmy prosperity of the Union.
If any sentiments, differing from these, have obtained among us, it is unknown to me. I avow these to be the sentiments which I entertain; I believe them to have universal currency, throughout New England.'
But we must refrain from further extracts from this address, and with the subjoined passages of a speech made a few years later, close by asking the reader to appeal from Caleb Cushing in these days of secession traitors, to Caleb Cushing in the days of Nullification:-
SPEECH OF CALEB CUSHING
On the Resolutions of Kentucky and Massachusetts, recommending the Distribution of the Proceeds of the Public Lands among the States. House of Representatives, May 23, 1836.
Our country, with all its sectional diversity of views and feelings, is one. It is one in the rich, manly, vigorous, expressive  language among us, which is become the vernacular tongue, as it were, of parliamentary eloquence, the very dialect of constitutional freedom. It is one in the fame of our fathers, and in the historical reminiscences which belong to us as a nation. It is one in the political principles of republicanism which we feel and profess in common, no matter in what spot of earth our portion be cast. It is one in the substantial basis of our manners, in the warp, at least, of which   the web is woven. It is one in the ties of friend ship, affinity, and   blood, binding us together, throughout the whole extent of the land, in the associations of trade, of emigration and of marriage. It is one in the general balance of interests and of business, arising from our mutual wants and the reciprocal interchanges of the products of our industry. It is one in our exterior relations, protected as these are by the honored flag of the Union. It is one in that glorious Constitution, the best inheritance transmitted to us by our fathers, the monument of their wisdom and their virtue, under whose shelter we live and flourish as a People.
One we are in fact, one should we be in sentiment. To this great Republic, union is peace, union is grandeur, union is power, union is honor, union is everything which a free-spirited and mighty nation should glory to possess. To us all, next to independence, next to liberty, next to honor, be we persuaded that a cordial and abiding confederacy of the American People is the greatest of earthly goods. We, the several States which compose it, entered into it with conciliation to the people of our sister States in our hearts, and compromise of all secondary interests in our acts. Thus let us persevere, with the same emotions, fresh and bright as in the first conception, and welling forth in exhaustless abundance from our bosoms; feeling that, like the fabled fountains of Florida, they are capable to communicate matchless beauty and everlasting youth to this our be loved Republic.
That, unlike other political societies, this  will endure unchangeable forever, I cannot hope; but I pray to God, if in the decrees of his providence he have any mercy in store for me, not to suffer me to behold the hour of its dissolution; its glory extinct; the banner of its pride rent and trampled in the dust; its nationality a moral of history; its grandeur, a lustrous vision of the morning slumber, vanished; its liberty a disembodied spirit, brooding, like the genius of the past, amid the prostrate monuments of its old magnificence.
And there is in the burning chambers of the dread hereafter, no infinity of wrath vast enough for him, who, Erostratus-like, to be remembered only for infamy, shall apply the torch of destruction to this fair Ephesians temple of our Union. That time, in some long, long future age, and that person, may come, for the overthrow of our country. Accursed be the traitor, whensoever and shall be his advent among us, like the spirit of evil, issuing from his realms of darkness to trouble the pure bliss of Paradise! To him that shall compass or plot the dissolution of this Union, I would apply language resembling what I remember to have' seen of an old anathema:- Wherever fire burns, or water runs; wherever ship floats, or land is tilled; wherever the skies vault themselves, or the lark carols to the dawn, or sun shines, or earth greens in his ray; wherever God is worshipped in temples or heard in thunder; wherever man is honored or woman loved;-there, from thenceforth and forever, shall there be to him no part or lot in the honor of man or the love of woman. Ixion�s revolving wheel, the overmantling cup at which Tantalus may not slake his unquenchable thirst, the insatiable vulture gnawing at the immortal heart of Prometheus, the rebel giants writhing in the volcanic fires of Etna, are but faint types of his doom. 
I speak plainly and strongly, as I feel, and without mincing my words; because I believe it to be the duty of every man, and especially of us, who are among the appointed sentinels of the Constitution, to look well to these, the issues of life and death to the nation. I do not, I cannot, I will not, believe that opinions, adverse hereto, exist any where within the bounds of the Republic; and I would forestall their possible future upspringing. I would have our allegiance to the Union unshaken and unshakable, our constancy in the public cause fixed as the north star in the firmament; our dedication to its interest, a vestal fire burning on with unextinguishable flame forever. Here, in the eyes of our countrymen, and of the world, with the muse of history before us to record our deeds and our words, let us, like Hannibal at the altar of his gods, swear eternal faithfulness to our country, eternal hatred to its foes. Show me that we are wedded to the Union for weal and for woe, as the fondest lover would hug to his heart the bride bound to him in the first bright ardor of young possession. 
We have not purposed to embark in this venture only to sail over the smooth surface on a summer sea, with hope and pleasure to waft us joyously along; but with resolved spirits, ready to meet, like true men, whatever of danger and vicissitude may descend upon our voyage, and to stand up gallantly for the treasures of honor and faith intrusted to our charge. Rally we, then, to the stripes and stars, as the symbol of glory to us, and the harbinger of liberty to all the nations of the world. So long as a shred of that sacred standard remains to us, let us cling to it, with such undying devotion as the Christian pilgrims of the middle age cherished the least fragment of the cross; and let us fly to its rescue, when perilled, whether by foreign or domestic assault, as they did to snatch the holy sepulchre from the desecration of the infidel.
<c03>
The Liberator.
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
BOSTON, DECEMBER 7, 1860.
NO SLAVE-HUNTING IN MASSACHUSETTS. 
The following petition is now in the hands of reliable friends of freedom, in all parts of the Commonwealth, for immediate circulation. It is precisely the same which, for the two preceding years, has been signed by thousands of the most virtuous and humane portion of the people, and which ought to be subscribed by every man and woman in Massachusetts. Those to whom it has been sent are earnestly urged to be up and doing, for the time is short between the present and the period for the assembling of the Legislature. Let every family, and every person, be tested by its presentation; let it be (as it will) a revelation of character and of purpose; and let the world know how many there are among us who �remember those in bonds as bound with them,� and are therefore for protecting the fugitive, or, on the other hand, how many are still for allowing slave-hunters to seize their prey with impunity on the Puritan and Revolutionary soil of the old Bay State, and to act as their accomplices in kidnapping.
To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts:
The undersigned, citizens of Massachusetts, respectfully ask you to put an end to SLAVE-HUNTING in Massachusetts, by enacting that no person, who has been held as a Slave, shall be delivered up, by any officer or court, State or Federal, within this Commonwealth, to any one claiming him on the ground that he owes 'service or labor' to such claimant, by the laws of one of the Slave States of this Union.

ANOTHER DASTARDLY ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
In accordance with public notice, the Convention to consider the question, �How can American Slavery be Abolished?�-called by' a number of young men, unconnected, at this time, with any organization,�-was attempted to be held at the Tremont Temple, on Monday last. Provision was made for three sessions, the first commencing at 11 o'clock, A. M. As is usually the case when three meetings are to be held the same day, it was supposed by those friendly to the Convention that there would be a small attendance at the forenoon session, which would be somewhat increased in the afternoon, and largely augmented in the evening, when rest from the toils of the day gives the necessary leisure for a general gathering. It was our impression that the Convention would prove comparatively a failure, as the Call did not emanate from a source calculated to carry any personal weight, and as no conference or consultation whatever was had with the long-tried advocates of the Anti-Slavery cause, who, if they had been consulted, would have suggested a very different mode of procedure, and who had nothing to do with it directly. Still, it was the unquestionable right of the �young men' alluded to, to invite to a conference all who desire the overthrow of slavery; and in extending their invitation to the leaders and representatives of all the different Anti-Slavery bodies, and to various men of eminence who have done honor to their own souls by advocating the cause of impartial freedom, �they evinced the broadest catholicity of spirit. 
There was nothing peculiar, nothing exceptionable, nothing limited, in the question proposed for consideration. All the various conflicting opinions in regard to its true solution, as far as the time would permit, were to have utterance on a free platform. It was a meeting for manly, candid and friendly discussion-not partisan, not one-sided, not exclusive-and, therefore, specially entitled to all the legal protection which the city authorities could extend, and to be held without molestation. None but mercenaries, dastards, ruffians, and pliant tools in the service of the devil, would presume to invade such a meeting, and by beastly bellowings, serpent-like hisses, and overwhelming numbers, take violent possession of it, and trample upon all the fundamental principles of, self-government. It is true, the meeting was held on the anniversary of the martyrdom of John Brown; but no better day could have been selected in the whole calendar, and the right of citizens peaceably to assemble on any day they please is not to be questioned, nor tamely surrendered. Nevertheless, it was expressly stated in the Call,-as if to calm the most excitable, and to prevent all misapprehension,-that �every one thus invited is expected, in his speeches or letters, to confine himself exclusively to the great Question of the Day,' and not to indulge in any glorification of John Brown. Hundreds of similar meetings have been held in this city, thousands in this Commonwealth, tens of thousands in various parts of New England, and hundreds of thousands throughout the, North, during the last thirty years. It did not present, therefore, the slightest novelty, and, under the circumstances, if it had been left to itself (as we have already remarked,) would in all probability have proved almost a dead failure.
But so it was not to be. As in 1835, stimulated by their infernal greed of the gains of trade, however basely acquired, and hoping to conciliate the robbers of God's perishing poor and needy at the South, the soi disant  gentlemen of property and� standing' in Boston rallied in mobocratic array, and bravely assailed and dispersed a little gathering of females called to consider the same subject of slavery, �(thus bringing historical infamy upon Boston to the end of time,-so, a contemptible portion of the same well-dressed, 'respectable,' but most unprincipled devotees at the shrine of Mammon, [that is, their lineal successors,] made their appearance in a solid body at the meeting on Monday, by stealthy agreement and with unity of purpose, and exhibited themselves in clear sunlight as lost to all shame, destitute of all decency, devoid of common sense, dastards in spirit, ruffians in action, and fit associates for the vilest of the vile. What they did, and how they behaved, let the record of their mobocratic proceedings, as copied mainly from the Post and Courier, their own venal organs, as given in another portion of our paper, testify. They easily succeeded in breaking up the meeting, as the number of those present friendly to it were few, (just as we anticipated they would be at a preliminary gathering,) and too much imbued with the spirit of peace and patient forbearance to meet their assailants with the weapons of violence. Indeed, they were wholly taken by surprise; for   while, in consequence of some flying rumors, they  were anticipating more or leas of rowdyish annoyance at the evening session, they expected no disturbance whatever during the day.
The inevitable result of this dastardly outrage will be to give to what had else been of little moment, extraordinary corspicuity, power, interest and eclatto stimulate afresh the friends of immediate emancipation in their labors for the abolition of slavery,-to strengthen the Anti-Slavery enterprise and increase;-its resources,-to demonstrate the incompatibility of the slaveholding spirit, as well at the North as in the, South, with freedom of speech and Republican institutions, and thus to concentrate upon it the indignation of a free people until it be driven out with universal execration, no more to curse our soil and breed anarchy in the Commonwealth. If this had been the first attempt by violence to suppress the sympathies of the human heart, to stifle the convictions of conscience, to inaugurate 'the reign of terror' on free soil, to 'squelch out the abolitionists,' (quote the vernacular of the Boston Post) the participants therein might be excused, to some extent, on the ground of short-sightedness and utter inexperience; but, as it is the last of a series of similar riotous outbreaks
<c04>
extending through a period of thirty years, all over the country, every one of which has done far more to advance the Abolition movement than any unmolested effort in its behalf could possibly have accomplished, and all of them together mightily hastening the day of jubilee, the stupidity of the rioters is matched by nothing but their, selfish  malignity. Their outbreak is as impotent as it was despicable. If, when the Anti-Slavery cause was in its infancy when its friends were 'few. and far between'-when every form of violence and every device of Satan were resorted to, throughout the country, to stop its onward course-it triumphed over all opposition-what folly and madness it is in Mr. Richard S. Fay, Mr. J. Murray Howe, and their riotous confederates, to imagine that by a single lawless procedure on their part, as exhibited on Monday last, they can bring that glorious cause to the ground, now that it is strong enough to control the political action of sixteen States of the Union, and virtually to determine the destiny of the nation! 'O, fools and blind!' 
Let not any abroad imagine that the least importance is to be attached to this convulsive spasm of mercenary scoundrelism. The Boston of 1835 is not the Boston of 1860.There is no parallel between the two cases.
Of the immediate actors in this outrage, the two most guilty were Richard S. Fay, of Lynn,-having a residence also on Beacon Street,-and James Murray Howe, of Brookline. Hereafter, theirs is to be an infamous reputation. The resolutions presented by the former for the adoption of the meeting, such is their despotic tone and murderous spirit,-are worthy of an admirer of king Bomba, and a follower of Capt. Kidd. 
Of course, the severest condemnation is merited by Mayor Lincoln, who, by his constabulary force, violently suppressed the Convention, ejected from the hall those who alone were rightfully entitled to the use of it, who had not misbehaved in any manner, and who were therefore entitled to the fullest protection, but who, nevertheless, were the special objects of police violence-women not excepted. It is true, the evening meeting at Joy Street Church was efficiently protected against the surrounding mob by the Mayor and his posse; but this cannot atone for his high-handed procedure in forcibly closing the Temple. 
The Courier, as a villanous sheet, naturally sanctions, applauds, and gloats over this rowdyism.
LETTER TO THE CONVENTION. 
BOSTON, Dec. 1, 1860. 
DEAR SIR,�Abstaining by medical advice from all public speaking at present, in consequence of a bronchial difficulty, I can only respond by letter to the invitation extended to me by the committee of arrangements, to participate in the proceedings of the Convention to be held at the Temple on Monday next, in order 'to mark the anniversary of the martyrdom of John Brown,' and to consider the question, 'How can American slavery be abolished?' 
My method of abolishing slavery is before the country, and has been for the last thirty years. I see no inducement to change or modify it, in any material respect. Briefly, it is comprised in these particulars: 
1. To brand slavery as essentially, self-evidently and eternally unjust, as applied to any portion of mankind; and, therefore, not to be made a debatable question, nor a matter of policy, nor dependant upon any contingency for its abolition; on the contrary, it is to be abhorred, denounced, assailed, in season and out of season, without forbearance or mercy, without compromise or procrastination, by every legitimate weapon, until it cease to pollute and curse the land. 
2. Being a system of unparalleled enormity, its upholders and abettors should be the objects of continual warning, entreaty, expostulation, rebuke, exposure and assault. No religious body, claiming the Christian name, and exercising any discipline whatever, should allow any such to be recognized as competent to membership. None of them should be elevated to any position of public trust and emolument. They should be subjected to universal moral and social outlawry. Public indignation should burn like fire against them. They are the deadliest enemies of domestic tranquillity, of public order, of sound morality, of sacred law, of general prosperity. Towards the objects of their oppression, they reverse all the rules of justice, all the requirements of humanity, all the axioms of political economy, and consign them to a fate a thousand times more to be dreaded than untimely death. They perpetrate all crimes in the one act of making merchandize of their fellow-creatures, and hence give unbounded scope to licentiousness, brutality, robbery and murder; and when their conduct is called in question, instantly their passions are 'set on fire of hell,' and they  behave like demons. Witness the present state of the South, blending as it does the maniacal ravings of Bedlam with the torments of the damned!
3. For the slave, every demand is to be made that one human being may claim of another. Immediate and unconditional emancipation�the recognition and protection of his manhood by law�the power to make contracts, to receive wages, to accumulate property, to acquire knowledge, to dwell where he chooses, to defend his wife, children, and fireside. Were the patriots of 1776 justified in rising up in insurrection, and resisting British oppression unto death? Then are the slaves of the South to be justified, a thousand times more, in imitating their example, and making ' Liberty or Death' their motto�enduring as they do, to quote the language of Jefferson in  their case, 'a bondage, one hour of which is fraught with more misery than ages of that which we rose in rebellion to oppose.' Did our revolutionary fathers deserve foreign sympathy, and was it meritorious on the part of France to aid them to achieve their independence? So do the slaves serve as much sympathy and aid at the hands of all who believe in the Bunker Hill process of making tyranny bite the dust. Was it to the immortal honor of Lafayette, that he drew his sword and perilled his life for our deliverance? Still more is it to the glory of John Brown and his associates at Harper's Ferry, that they staked all that was dear to them, and nearly all perished, in the attempt to liberate the sable bondmen in Virginia. 'Sic semper tyrannis! Brand the man as a hypocrite and dastard, who, in one breath, exults in the deeds of Washington and Warren, and in the next, denounces Nat Turner as a monster for refusing longer to wear the yoke and be driven under the lash, and for taking up arms to defend his God-given rights. If the doctrine of non-resistance ought to be spurned for oppressed white men, it is equally to be spurned for oppressed black men. Weapons of death for all, or for none, who are struggling to be free. Let Hancock and Adams lie covered with infamy, or the black liberators who aided John Brown be honored in history. 
Thus do I defend the manhood of the humblest slave as on a level with that of his lordly tyrant, and thus do I place them together on the same equality of natural rights. Thus do I test the nation by its own revolutionary standard, taking Bunker Hill monument for my measuring line. No matter for race or complexion�'a man's a man, for a that.' But, for myself, I believe in the inviolability of human life, and therefore disarm, by my principles, alike the oppressor and the oppressed. I believe in the immense superiority of spiritual over carnal weapons, and so seek not the overthrow of slavery by a bloody process. But, assuredly, were I a convert to the doctrine of '76, that a resort to the sword is justifiable to recover lost liberty, then would I plot insurrection by day and by night, deal more is blows and less in words, and seek through blood the emancipation of all who are groaning in captivity at the South. 
Finally, I am for taking away all the props which now sustain the slave system, sad thus effecting its speedy and eternal overthrow. 
Yours, for no union with slaveholders,
WM. LLOYD GARRISON. 
JAMES REDPATH, Esq.
<c05>
MRS. HOWE'S 'TBIP TO CUBA.'
BOSTON, Dec. 1, 1860.
DEAR MR.GARRISON: 
You are probably already aware of your mistake in attributing to Mrs. Howe an article in the Atlantic Monthly, which displeased you�several  expressions in which grieved me also. Upon this, accordingly, as a recognized mistake, no more need be said here. But allow me lo remonstrate somewhat against the extreme severity of your allusion to the Trip to Cuba.' I observed, and observed with sorrow, that you placed an extract from this book in your 'Refuse of. Oppression,' while it was in course of publication in the Atlantic. Consider what the Authoress meant to do�to stand quite aside from all grave questions, and give sprightly sketches at the scenes which came before her eyes. She looked at things not in their relation to present duty, not in their relation to future history, but only in their immediate aspects; and drew her picture accordingly. Meeting one day with some human beings of a very low type, who happened to be Negroes,�not because they were Negroes, but because they were human beings of a low and degraded  type,�she found herself not enamored of them, and frankly said so. I remember having similar impressions, many years ago. in walking over Southern plantations; and I never, to this day, picture to myself those imbruted faces, without a fainter beat of the heart�without an appalling anticipation of the work which lies beyond the abolition of slavery, namely, the still more important, and still more difficult, abolition of slavishness. 
Theodore Parker, following Blumenbach's division of the human species into five orders, assigned emphatically the lowest rank to the  Negro. Letters passed between him and myself on the subject,�I disputing, without effect, the inferiority of the Negroes to the American Indians. I continue of the same mind; yet my claim for them is not that they are wise, or witty, or handsome, but only that they are MEN, and that justice shall be done them. Wise ones are doubtless found among them; witty ones are frequent; I have seen some who were strikingly handsome; and I think beauty just as possible to men of their color as to men of ours. Yet, as a whole, I cannot deny that the Negro race has accomplished little,�sadly, sadly little, in history; and I cannot deny that, among them, in far too great numbers for my cheer, are found features and expressions that make me shudder. Such blacks I shall not admire a whit more than if they were whites. I shall express dislike of them, disgust at them, as readily as though they were of the Caucasian complexion, and lived in Beacon street. What more did the authoress of the 'Trip to Cuba'?  She said wittily, what I might not say wittily�that is all. The tone of light raillery and half-biting playfulness, which pervades her sketches, is simply continued, when she comes to speak of the blacks.  Were it reserved for them alone, we might suspect her of lack of compassion; but her light shocks of electric banter are played off on all alike�on the great Theodore, no less than the Negroes of Nassau. We roust remember, too, that her voice has been heard before, and heard in words of high and faithful testimony. Take these:�
'Thy cause needs no appealing�wrongs like thine,
Nature makes dumb with greatness�do they crave 
The lowliness of Pity? from all hearts 
Thou hast it with this thought: here was a Slave.'
A heart true to freedom, warm and sisterly toward the slave, I know it would hurt your heart to wound. Look, my dear sir, whether your hand, in this instance, Lave not dons what your heart least desired.
D. A. WASSON. 
REPLY. We lose no time in expressing our regret, that we so hastily attributed to Mrs. Howe the article in the last Atlantic Monthly, upon which we commented in terms of just, but indignant severity. We have no personal feelings in the matter, and are glad to find we were at fault in our supposition of authorship. As for the apology of our friend Mr. Wasson, for the banter of 'a low and degraded type of Negroes contained in the 'Trip to Cuba,' it seems to be satisfactory to him, because (we are sorry to learn) he has experienced 'similar impressions' towards the same unfortunate class! It is not so to us. Is it possible that a humane and refined mind can make sport, or may be justified in making it, of 'such imbruted faces' as caused the heart of our friend W. to 'beat fainter'? What, then, is low or inhuman? It is not a question of 'admiration ' of the blacks, but of genuine pity and compassionate consideration. Mr. Wasson says�'I shall express dislikes of them, disgust at them, as readily as though they were of the Caucasian complexion, and lived in Beacon street.' Beacon street is above private dislike or disgust, and the Caucasian race is now proudly dominant.

For the Liberator. 
PHILIP VANDAL. 
Long years he bore the taunt and gibe,
The scorn of fool, the wrath of knave,
The hate of Pharisee and Scribe, 
That crowns the man who loved the slave.
There comes a lull: the rowdies bold
Have fired with popgun, eggs, and squirt,
Who catcalls now? What you, who hold
Professorship of modern-dirt?
You, who, unplaced, unbought, could sing 
Of him who stood on God's own side, 
From feathered nest now dart to sting 
The man who dares with God abide.
What, are you dazzled, as you shine 
With girls who print their mental leaks;
Beflushed with little jests and wine 
Of little dilettanti cliques?
Know that the poet's lips are dumb 
When, filled with worldling's meat and drink,
You strive to cast reproach on one 
Who dares to be what poets think.
Could he have faltered from the right, 
His social place had trebled thine;
Nor revellers asked on festal night 
Faint puns to mingle with their wine.
'Young Philip Vandal'! why, the sneer 
Strikes back to shame thee with a tru'h;
Behold the man who does not fear 
To trust the insight of his youth!
Still burns his torch through blackest night,
Through changing wind, through shifting storm, 
While, paid and puffed, you softly write
Your comic, popular reform!
Well! nestle in the easy berth,
Pun on in the professor's chair,-
But fear to measure by thy worth
What nobler men can do and dare!

LETTER OF ENGLISH BAPTISTS TO REV.
BARON STOW, D.D. 
I have received from England a copy of a paper published in Bristol, entitled-'The Mirror of the Anti-Slavery Straggle. Published to promote the Abolition of American Slavery, by defeating its attempts to find a shelter in the British churches.�
No.3 of this paper is entirely devoted to a consideration of the question-'Does the Rev. Baron Stow, D. D., of Boston, in the United States, sanction slavery, or not ?' This had been made a subject of special inquiry by the London Board of Baptist Ministers, who were moved thereto by the direct contradiction between Dr. Stow's statements, at his visit to England last year, and certain details of evidence respecting his pro-slavery position at home, which were laid before them. The matter was thoroughly sifted, and the details of evidence in regard to it are set forth in this paper, convicting Dr. Stow not only of gross misrepresentation, but of direct violation of the truth, in his replies to his Baptist brethren in England, respecting the relation which he sustained to slavery at home.
<c06>
This evidence fully and decisively establishes the following points:� 
1. That Dr. Stow, having many years ago favored Anti-Slavery action, has now for a long period apostatized from this ground, returned to full fraternization with the pro-slavery majority of the Baptist clergy in this country, and given his influence to the support of the slave system in the South, and the maintenance of the kindred system of caste in the North.
2. That among the evidence of his fraternization with pro-slavery clergymen, is the preaching in his pulpit (August 15th, 1858.) of Rev. Dr. Richard Fuller, who has been one of the persons most widely known in this country as a slaveholder and a public defender of slavery.
3. That among the evidence of his choosing to stand on the side of slavery, is his position among the Managers of the Southern Aid Society, and of the American Tract Society; and his publicly refusing to remain a member of the Executive Committee of the Boston Tract Society, when that body took the very moderate step forward of consenting �fraternally to discuss the moral evils which slavery is known to promote.�
4. That among the evidence of his upholding the anti-Christian system of caste, is the provision, printed in the pew-deeds of his church, and never opposed by a word of protest from himself, that its pews shall be sold to none but a 'respectable white person'; a provision, the letter and spirit of which are so stringently maintained, that for many years no colored person has chosen to join either the church or the congregation.
5. That among the evidence corroborative of all these things, are the facts that for sixteen or eighteen years past, Dr. Stow has never preached against slavery, nor against the injustice inflicted by Church, State, and common custom upon the colored people of the North, nor even against the atrocious Fugitive Slave Law; that he has never spoken against either of these in any of his publications; that his meeting-house has never been granted for the holding of anti-slavery meetings; and that he has held himself aloof from all union with movements, and all concert with persons, opposed to slavery.
When the evidence proving these things was fully in possession of the London Board of Baptist Ministers, they wrote the following letter to Dr. Stow:-
12 ROCKINGHAM ROW EAST, New Kent Road,
LONDON, England, Feb 29th, 1860.
DEAR SIR,- As Secretary of 'the Board of Baptist Ministers in and near London,' I beg to forward to you the enclosed copy of a Report lately presented thereto, and briefly to state its origin and basis. Some of the brethren scrupled the correctness of your avowal that you are decidedly an anti-slavery man, (which in this country is synonymous with an earnest Abolitionist,) made to the Committee of our Missionary Society in July last, upon the ground of which, through the Freeman newspaper, you were recommended to the fellowship of our body throughout the land. Therefore at the quarterly meeting of the Board held in August last, eight of the members united in a requisition to me for a special meeting upon the question. In consequence of absence from home upon my part, this meeting was not held until October 18th last. A Committee of four brethren besides myself were then appointed to investigate the matter in the terms given in the heading of the Report. The next regular meeting of the Board was held in the month following, (November,) but the interval had been too brief for the collection of the necessary evidence. Hence the Report of the Committee was not presented until the subsequent quarterly meeting held on January 31st, 1860. A considerable amount of evidence was adduced in support of the Report. It was unanimously received, and it was resolved that a copy of it be sent to you, and that you be respectfully requested to give the Board any explanation in your power of the allegations it contains, prior to the next quarterly meeting. I regret that some delay in my compliance with this order has been occasioned by my numerous engagements, including an absence from home.
The evidence upon which the Committee found their report is furnished by several distinguished philanthropists, chiefly in Boston, and by various American ministers, Baptists and others. Much also has been obtained from sundry publications, including 'Facts for Baptist Churches,' a volume published by the American Baptist Free Mission Society, 1850; Goodell's 'Slavery and Anti-Slavery'; C. K. Whippie's Relations of Anti-Slavery to Religion', published by the American Anti-Slavery Society; Judge Jay's 'American Tract Society'; and various reports, addresses, and circulars issued by the societies mentioned in the report, as well as newspaper articles. The Committee possess evidence upon every item in their report.
One of the copies of the pew deed is a printed from which has not been used; the other is written from a printed one now in force, with the blanks filled up. Mr. C. K. Whipple states that this pew deed has been exposed through the press in Boston not fewer than ten times, and that it is still acted upon in your place of worship. It is understood that at this day no African and no person of African descent is a proprietor of a pew, or may become a purchaser of one in your so-called 'church,' especially upon the ground floor. This, in the estimation of the Committee, is having ' the faith of the Lord Jesus, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons,' contrary to the teaching of the New Testament. They are informed that you have admitted your silence as a preacher and an author respecting slavery, -silence which, in the circumstances of your country, they deem to be as culpable as would be the ignoring of drunkenness or any other prominent vice. In their opinion, too, confederation with those who hold slaves, and with those who plead for slavery, is to be rebuked as holding fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness. They believe, further, that prejudice against color is as absurd as it is unchristian. They hold it to be an insult to our 'One Father,' and an injustice to our neighbor; in fact, to be nothing else and nothing better than incipient slavery, both the parent and the nurse of the system. The expression of this prejudice furnishes a passport to the confidence of the slaveholder, silences the reproofs of conscience, and wipes off the odium which attaches to the �institution.' Hence they are firmly of opinion, that so long as this prejudice is cherished in the North, it is in vain to expect the extinction of slavery in the South.
Believing slavery to be the very essence of sin, the grossest outrage upon the rights of man, the fruitful parent of the most loathsome impurities, and the most daring invasion of the prerogatives of the Most High, the Committee are of opinion that English Christians should not only withdraw from those who openly countenance these abominations, but should equally withdraw from those whose guilty silence emboldens the abettors of the enormity; whose associations with pro-slavery churches and preachers encourage them in transgression, by blunting the edge of remonstrance, and weakening the voice of conscience. They rejoice in the persuasion that these are the views of the Board, and of the Baptists throughout the British nation.
If you reply, permit me to request that you will do so promptly. Should I receive no letter from you prior to our next quarterly meeting, the inference will be that you decline to offer any explanation as sought by the Board.
I am, dear sir, yours faithfully,
[Signed] W.M. BARKER, Secretary.
To the Rev. BARONSTOW, D. D., Boston, U.S 
The Mirror of the Anti-Slavery Struggle states that since, after the lapse of six months, no answer to this letter has been received from Dr. Stow, the Baptists of England are obliged to infer that he can offer neither defence nor explanation. They accordingly publish the statement of facts and array of evidence above referred to, and, feeling assured that thousands of American ministers are equally guilty with Dr. Stow, they �call upon him and upon them to give up either the ministry and name of Christ, or their fellowship with men-stealers.' C.N.W

JOHN BROWN ANNIVERSARY.
CONCORD, (N.H.,) John Brown's Day,
DECEMBER 2d, 1860.
TO THE EDITOR:
Since the wondrous Resurrection morn of 1860 years ago, (church computation,) there has not risen on our world a more important anniversary than occurs to-day; one year from the martyrdom of the noble and brave Captain Brown.
And I have been considering whether, among the forty thousand pulpits that bestud the country, so many as forty would dare breathe aloud the name of him who, by his suffering, one year ago, in behalf of humanity, hallowed the gallows of Virginia as the counterpart of the cross of Calvary.
How many ministers to-day shall thus shall thus dare be true

to the cross of Jesus, as borne by the great martyr of the present century in behalf of the captives, them 'captives,' and them that are bound, may never appear. But I have taken my pen to testify for one.
Being off the post of public duty to-day, from bodily fatigue, I attended in the morning at the <illegible> church of our town, Rev. Mr. Moore's. We have some ten or a dozen places of Sunday <illegible> here; but no 'living reachers' of any account, excepting Mr. Moore; and he has more than once been strongly desired to depart out of our coasts,
In the sermon this morning, we had portrayed some of the characteristics of the Living Pulpit, as distinguished from those fossilized forms of it, before which so many bow, vainly, as once in the temples of Dagon. And in one of his most eloquent passages, he paid a passing tribute to the name of him of Harpers Farley, worthy to be paraphrased in to a doxology in long metre, and sung in all the Churches of Humanity, to the end of time.
It is complained of me, sometimes, that I do not give credit where it is due. For once, surely, I am guiltless in that matter. And, by the shade of Daniel Webster, I dare affirm, I never 'perform a more agreeable duty than charitably and honorably to discriminate between a truly apostolic pulpit,, and those forty thousand fossilized shrines of Dagon and Diana, whose fires have long been extinguished, but whose <illegible> ashes are still fed, Sunday by Sunday, to our <illegible> myriads, as though the very bread of life.
PARKER PILLSBURY.
CONVENTION AT MENDOTA.
ELMWOOD, Peoria Co., Ill., Nov. 15th, 1860. 
The Convention at Mendota, in this State, on the10th and 11th inst. has already, I presume, been reported by its officers, but I am tempted to add a few <illegible> words. This Convention for various reasons was not so numerously attended as it deserved, but in all other respects was quite successful; especially was it successful in showing the weakness and rottenness of that <illegible> rigging philosophy, which teaches that anti-slavery men may dodge moral responsibility in sustaining pro-slavery organizations.
We are pained to find that many of our friends have been drawn, for the time being, into the popular current sufficiently to give their votes to a party which is pledged to maintain inviolate in fifteen States, an institution which we are laboring to destroy, thus seriously affecting the force and value of their testimony against the iniquitous bargains by which four millions of native Americans are robbed of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
<Illegible> faithfulness to his poor clients,-the outraged and wronged in all houses of bondage,- is characteristic of Mr. Pillsbury; and his speeches on this occasion being no exception, two or three Love-joy Republicans became somewhat agitated, and made spirited, if not weighty replies.
One gentleman seemed to be considerably excited because, as he alleged, Mr. Pillsbury called him a leave or a fool for his position on the United States Constitution. Mr. P. remarked that as he had made use of no such language, the accusation might have proceeded, perhaps, from an awakened voice within; if so, he did not propose to take issue with the gentle-man's conscience. He did criticise, faithfully but in kindness, those who, claiming that there is nowhere in the United States Constitution the smallest possible guarantee for slavery, come reeking from the polls, where their votes were cast for Abraham Lincoln, now chief slave-hound elect of this nation.
It is not my purpose to speak of the addresses, as I suppose that will be done in the official report; but I desire to say that the closing address of Mr. Pillsbury on Sunday evening was grandly inspiring, and I could not help feeling, as I read in his countenance those indications of physical exhaustion which only friends, perhaps, would detect, that we must make the most of these occasions. Still, I am glad to know that Mr. P. finds Western air better for his health than that of the sea shore, and we shall look for his return in a few weeks at furthest. Surely, there is no part of the field which calls more imperatively for efficient laborers then this.
Our anti-slavery friends in the East, who have almost a surfeit of speakers and meetings, and may take each other almost daily by the hand, will hardly appreciate the eager interest with which the isolated laborers in the cause of impartial liberty, scattered far and wide on the prairies, gather to such a meeting as this at Mendota. We who are fighting this battle almost singly in our respective localities, need to be sometimes encouraged and inspirited by looking into the eyes and grasping the hands of the noble men and women brought together by such Conventions; and I am sure if our Eastern friends would consider the immensity of this Western field, and its importance to the future of the anti-slavery movement, they would not grudge us the presence and aid of Mr. Pillsbury through all the coming year. A noticeable feature of this Convention was the goodly number of intelligent and excellent women who attended all its sessions; such as Mrs. N. P. Rogers, Mrs. Philleo, (historically known as Prudence Crandall,) Mrs. C. B. Campbell, Mrs. Hilles, and all others. E. R. BROWN.

WEYMOUTH A.S. SOCIETY.
THE ANNUAL MEETING of the Weymouth and Braintree Anti-Slavery Society was held on the 8th of Oct. The Board of officers of last year was again chosen in full.
A report was read, adopted, and ordered to be printed in the Standard and Liberator, reviewing the past, taking action for the present, and resolving for the future, in a manner too thorough to be done in a very short compass. The Secretary was therefore subsequently excused from preparing it for the press, at a period when every column of the anti-slavery papers is unusually crowded; and the Treasurer's Report, embodied in it, was alone retained for publication.

At a meeting of the Board of officers of the Female Anti-Slavery Society of Weymouth and Brain-tree, held Nov. 21, 1860, the following resolutions were adopted:-
Resolved, That in the recent death of Miss MARY WESTON, one of the first members, and for many years Recording Secretary of this Society, we have sustained a loss, deeply felt, and we fear not easily repaired. To her worth and faithful exertions in the cause of the oppressed, and to our affectionate remembrance of her many virtues, we offer this feeble testimony, to be inscribed in the records of this Society.
Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to the respected family and to the absent friends of the deceased, as a token of our sympathy and regard.
Resolved, That these resolutions be inserted in the Liberator and Standard.

MOBOCRATIC ASSAULT UPON AN ANTI-SLAVERY MEETING IN BOSTON. 
The Meeting forcibly suppressed by order of Mayor Lincoln, who thus virtually headed the mob, but who is soon to receive his walking ticket Richard S. Fay and J. Murray Howe the principal spokesmen for the rioters-Resolutions adopted by the rioters, as presented by Richard S. Fay-Free Anti-Slavery Speech no longer to be tolerated, yet-triumphant in the evening at the Joy Street Church-Brutal assault upon colored citizens-Second Battalion under arms-&c., &c,
Below, we give a very full account of the riotous conduct of the well-dressed rowdies-mostly of the Bell-Everett party, with a sprinkling of the Custom House demon-ocracy-at the Anti-Slavery Convention, held at the Tremont Temple on Monday fore noon. This account is compiled from the various daily papers of Tuesday, but chiefly from the Post. 
Pursuant to the following notice, a large number of persons gathered yesterday morning in Tremont Temple:-
A public Convention will be held in Tremont Temple during the day and evening of Monday, December 3d, to mark the Anniversary of the Martyrdom of John Brown, (which occurred December 2d, 1859,)'1859.) and to consider the Great Question of the Age, How can American Slavery be Abolished? The speakers who will address the meeting will confine themselves exclusively to the great question of the day; for it would be a work of supererogation now to defend John Brown, and a useless waste of time to eulogise him; and it is believed that a practical consideration of the above subject will be the most appropriate commemoration of his glorious death. The Convention will not be one for debate, but each speaker will give his own views on the question in as brief a manner as he may be able, and no person will speak more than once. 
Shortly after ten oclock, Mr. James Red path appeared on the platform, and attempted to call the meeting to order. 
Great confusion ensued, some hissing, others applauding. 
Mr. Redpath-I call upon every gentleman of Boston present-
The speaker could not proceed. Three cheers were given. Cries-Put him out! All up! We will not let you talk here. Order, order!
On quiet being again restored, J. Sella Martin (colored) proposed a committee to nominate a list of officers. He had not finished reading the list when he was interrupted by hissings, stampings, outcries, &c, &c, which rendered it impossible for him to proceed. 
Mr. Martin (tremendous noise)-Will you, gentlemen, please preserve order? 
Cries-No, no! 
Martin-Well, this is a splendid affair. 
Voice-You sit down. 
Martin-Gentlemen, I hope this is not South Carolina. 
Suddenly Mr. James Redpath rushed from the platform, and was followed by the persons on the platform, some ten in number, and proceeded to one of the seats near the door, in the quarter where the disturbance apparently came from, and the next we saw of him he had a citizen by the collar, and was attempting to thrust him from the hall. The two were immediately surrounded by a band of evidently determined men. A general bustle ensued, and Red- path was forced to loose his hold. Loud talk ensued, and many threats were made. 
Mr. Martin-Will gentlemen please take their seats, and come to order?
Voice-Never, by Heaven! (Great confusion.) 
A man on the platform, in an excited manner, moved that a committee of one hundred be appointed to preserve order. The speaker's voice was drowned with applause, and cheer upon cheer for Gov. Packer, of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Martin-Will you come to order, and hear Mr. Sanborn, of Concord? 
Three cheers were given for Gov. Packer, of Pennsylvania. Cheers again. 
Martin-Mr. Sanborn, gentlemen. (Great confusion; some standing up; some talking aloud.) 
Cries for Gov. Packer' letter.
Sanborn-It seems to me this is a very extraordinary spectacle.
Cries-Packer's letter. Order-order! John Brown. Put him out. (Groaning.)
Sanborn-I understand that the call for the meeting was made by other gentlemen than those who now interrupt me. (Great confusion.)
Cries-John Andrew-John Andrew! John Andrew for Chairman. (Hissing. Cheers.) 
Sanborn-These men who have called the meeting have hired this room; are they not entitled to its use? 
A man on the platform, excited-shaking his fist-This thing don't stop here. 
Sanborn-This is not the Boston I have known When you hire your shops, you use them. Is not this ungentlemanly to disturb these gentlemen whose room this is for the time being?
Voice from the platform-We want no dictators. 
Great excitement, confusion and noise among those on the platform. Cheers were given for various persons. 
Cries-Give us John Brown's farewell words. This meeting is all up. Free speech. 
Sanborn-If any gentleman wants to speak or to discuss this question, he can do so when I am done. (Confusion.) Oh! really this does not seem to me the Boston I have known. 
Cries-Andrew! Andrew! 
Another row at one side of the room Cries-Put him out.
Sanborn-I hope there are some gentlemen here. (Confusion and great noise.) 
Voice-Where's the Union?
Sanborn We come to discuss the subject of American slavery. 
Voice-Where's John Brown? 
Voice-He's safe. 
Another voice-The devil has him. 
Voice from the platform-No matter where he may be. 
Sanborn-Every man is entitled to express his own opinions. 
Cries-No! No! (Three cheers.) 
Sanborn-Cannot every man say what he thinks, at stated times and in proper places? 
Cries-Yes! Yes! (Great noise.)
Sanborn-Then this meeting is called for the expression of such opinions. 
Three cheers were given 'for the Constitution.
On the platform-Three cheers given for free speech; amid cries of No! no! and hisses from the people on the floor. 
Mr. Sanborn said that gentlemen could speak when the meeting was organized. 
Cheering-hissing-groaning-laughter-applause-clapping of hands.
Cheers were given for the Union, and it was evident that the Union men were in the ascendant. 
At this juncture, Mr. Martin, as Chairman of the meeting, called upon the police to preserve order. 
Quiet was finally restored, before the interference of the officers, and Mr. Martin stated that the object of the meeting was to discuss the question-How shall American Slavery be Abolished?' He said they intended, in spite of the opposition, to hold their meetings.
He was frequently interrupted, and as he commenced a line of remarks denunciatory of slavery, there was another disturbance, and the police were again called upon. 
Mr. Hayes, Superintendent of the Temple, stepped to the front of the platform and said-The meeting will organize. (Cries of good! good!) The police are here. After the meeting is organized, you can take any action you choose. The police are here.
Mr. Martin again attempted to speak on the advertised object of the meeting. He said he would leave John Brown and his works to history. It is free discussion which we want. (Cheers.) We want you all, if we are wrong, to come up quietly, like gentlemen, and show us our error.
Colored man-Were not you once oppressed?
Voice near the platform-Let us have a citizen of the United States tell us our duty. 
Cries-Order! Order! Go on! Go on! 
Voice on the platform-I call upon the police to protect us, that we may be heard. (This was said three times.) 
John C. Cluer-That is right.
Voice-There is no meeting. 
Mr. Hayes-They must organize the meeting in-their own way. (Hisses and applause,)
Mr. Redpath here appeared upon the stand and commenced reading the report of the committee on permanent organization, with Frank Sanborn, of Concord, as Chairman, and John Oliver, of Boston as Secretary. 
Before he could conclude his report, a gentleman arose, and moved that Richard S. Fay be Chairman of the meeting.
He put the motion, and though the John Brown men constituted a respectable minority, the other party was very largely in the ascendency, and Mr. Fay was declared elected.
Mr. Fay very promptly accepted the duty thus put upon him, and proceeded at once to its discharge. His progress towards the platform was considerably impeded by excited groups, who crowded around him; but he went not up alone. Presently he had plenty of able men around him-Col. French, Mr.
<c03>
Perkins, Mr. Bacon, and a dozen others-it looked, too, as though he would have need of them, for it appeared as though a regular knock-down fight was imminent every moment. 
Great confusion on the platform. Great excitement among the John Brown men. Cries from all parties for order. 
Mr. Fay-I call upon the po-
The police here made their appearance on the plat-form. 
Mr. Hayes-These people are going to have this hall. They hired it. 
Voice-I move that the meeting now adjourn. 
Mr. Fay put the question. Carried. 
Mr. Fay-I call upon the police to clear the hall. 
Mr. Hayes-Gentlemen, Mr. Fay has refused to leave the hall. Where is <illegible> Chief of Police? 
Then there was quite a rush to the platform, and some little bustling. In one or two instances, fists were doubled up and canes raised. Mr. Fay, however, had possession of the chair, and spoke and looked as if he meant to retain it, and there were men behind him who looked as though they meant he should. 
A scene of the direst confusion followed. Every man took the floor. Mr. Hayes, Superintendent of the hall, occupied a prominent position on the platform, crying for Police! Police!
Then the Chief of Police busied himself by urging the people to sit down. 
Mr. Fay called upon the police to protect him in his office of Chairman of this meeting. 
A motion to adjourn, made by Mr. Thos. Farmer, of Roxbury, was declared by Mr. Fay to be carried.
The Abolitionists called upon their side to retire to the Meionaon. Finally both sides called for order, and Mr. Fay proposed to reorganize the meeting. The proposition was at once acceded to on all hands, and Mr. Fay was chosen Chairman. 
Mr. Fay said he was greatly obliged for the honor. He then read the call for the meeting, and contended that slavery could only be abolished under the law. He said-The meeting is now in order. I take great delight in being able to be here to-day. 
Fred. Douglass interrupted him by saying-Mr. Chairman, will you allow me one word? 
Fay-No! not yet! 
Voice-May I ask the President? Mr. President! May I ask-
Cries-Order! Order! Sit down! Throttle him! 
Mr. Martin-We do not recognize him as Chairman. 
Mr. Fay, (quite coolly)-If you keep quiet while I speak, you will hear some truths which you do not hear at home. (Applause.) 
The police, after quelling several small disturbances, attempted to restore order. 
Mr. Fay got the ear of the meeting, and was allowed to make a short address, chiefly of common-places about the Union, laws. Constitution, &c. Previous to this, he read the call of the Convention, and briefly expounded it. During his speech, Mr. Fay intimated that he was dry; whereupon Fred. Douglass, who sat near by, proffered a glass of water with, If thine enemy thirst, give him drink. [Laughter.] 
Mr. Fay-This meeting is only binding the fetters of the slave closer-with tenfold the strength. (Applause and hisses.) I am speaking in harmony with the sentiments of the reasoning men of the North and the South. (Applause and hisses.) If this thing goes on, you will see something in this land that will hang these gentlemen (looking at several colored persons behind him) as high as Haman. 
He also read a series of resolutions, denouncing John Brown and his Virginia raid, as follows:-
Whereas, it is fitting upon the occasion of the Anniversary of the execution of John Brown, for his piratical and bloody attempts to create an insurrection among the slaves of the State of Virginia, for the people of this Commonwealth to assemble and express their horror of the man, and of the principles which led to the foray,-
(Applause and hissing. Voice-Good! go on.) 
Therefore, it is resolved, 
1. That no virtuous and law-abiding citizen of this Commonwealth ought to countenance, sympathize or hold communion with any man who believes that John Brown and his aiders and abettors in that nefarious enterprise were right, in any sense of that. word. 
2. That the present perilous juncture in our political affairs, in which our existence as a nation is imperilled, requires of every citizen who loves his country to come forward, and to express his sense of the value of the Union, alike important to the free labor of the North, the slave labor of the South, and to the interests of the commerce, manufactures and agriculture of the world. 
3. That we tender to our brethren in Virginia our warmest thanks for the conservative spirit they have manifested, notwithstanding the unprovoked and lawless attack made upon them by John Brown and his associates, acting, if not with the connivance, at least with the sympathy of a few fanatics from the Northern States, and that we hope they will still continue to aid in opposing the fanaticism which is even now attempting to subvert the Constitution and the Union. 
Great noise. Several disturbances. 
Mr. Fay-When you get through, I will read on. I have come here to stay all day. 
4. That the people of this city have submitted too long in allowing irresponsible persons and political demagogues of every description to hold public meetings to disturb the public peace and misrepresent us abroad; they have become a nuisance, which, in self defence, we are determined shall henceforward be summarily abated. 
5. That a copy of these resolutions be sent to each of the persons named in the call for this meeting.
The resolutions were carried by a large majority. 
Fred. Douglass claimed the floor, and the Chair, reminding him of the short speech rule promulgated in the call, accorded it to him. 
A general scene of clamorous confusion ensued. Some crowded around the speaker. Among the assemblage all stood up-some on the backs of the seats 
The Chairman restored order by reminding the assemblage that the meeting was an organized one. 
Frederick Douglass got the floor, and denounced the interruption in terms of the greatest indignation. The Chairman was continually reminding him that the call required speakers to be brief. 
Fred. Douglass-This is one of the most impudent, (order! order!) barefaced, (knock him down! sit down!) outrageous acts on free speech (stop him! you shall hear him)-I can make myself heard- (great confusion) that I have ever witnessed in Boston or elsewhere. (Applause. Free speech.) I know your masters. (Cries-Treason! treason! Police! police! Put him out! put him out!) I have served the same master that you are serving. (Time! time! ) You are serving the slaveholders. 
Voice-No! no! We serve God, and the white man, and the nigger. 
Douglass-You are in the service of the slaveholders of the United States. 
The Chairman requested him to confine his remarks to the question at issue. 
Douglass-I am. 
Chairman-You are taking off your coat for a Iong speech. 
Cries-Time! time! 
Douglass-I know it is a hard time for you. 
The speaker denounced slaveholders. The noise was so great he could not be heard. 
Three disturbances occurred in different parts of the Temple-one on the platform. Police officers took up their position at the front part of the platform. 
Douglass-The freedom of all mankind was written on the heart by the finger of God. (Voices-Time! time!) It is said the best way to abolish slavery is to obey the law. Shall we obey the blood-hounds of the law who do the dirty work of the slave-catchers? If so, then you are fit for your work. Mr. Norris of New Hampshire asked Wade of Ohio, in the Senate of the United States, if he would render his personal assistance to the execution of the Fugitive Slave law, and that noble-hearted man and Christian gentleman replied, promptly, I will see you damned first. (Cries of time, time.) Sir, there is a law which we are bound to obey, and the Abolitionists are most prompt to obey it. It is that law written in the Constitution of the United States, saying all men are born free and equal, and that we include all colors, too. 
Chairman The Indians also? 
Mr. Douglass-Yes, Indians; and also that every man has a right to the use of his own body-even the President of this meeting. (Cries of time, time.) They cast aside with indignation the wild and guilty fantasy, that man owns property in man, even in that stout, big-fisted fellow down there, who has just insulted me. 
Here the uproar, which had been perfectly deafening for some minutes, increased so much that the speaker was inaudible. 
Mr. Douglass-Your meeting is a very disorderly one, Mr. Chairman. 
Chairman-I am very proud of this meeting. It is the most orderly out of the kind I ever attended. 
Mr. Douglass-The Chairman and I have disagreed on some points before in life. 
Douglass spoke for some minutes amid much confusion. 
Voice-Go on, nigger. 
Mr. Douglass-If I was a slave-driver, and had hold of that man for five minutes, I would let more day light through his skin than ever got there before. 
Chairman-He has said the truth, for a negro slave-driver is the most cruel in the world. 
<c04>
Mr. Douglass acknowledged this was so. Just as a Northern doughface is more contemptible than a Southern slaveholder! [Immense laughter and long continued applause.] 
Here the crowd became so anxious to have Mr. Douglass 'dry up, as they expressed it, that he reluctantly complied. 
Dr. Knox produced a sensation by calling upon the orator to keep the floor, in the name of God and his own right.
At this point, amidst the confusion, Dr. Knox was forced to the rear of the platform. 
After a little quiet had been restored, Rev. D. C. Eddy stepped to the front of the platform, and denounced the interruption as unworthy of the descendants of these who fought for freedom of speech in 76. He said: I come upon this platform to look into the faces of men who, in the year 1860, and within sight of Bunker Hill, are willing to trample on free discussion. I want to ask the young men of Boston and the grey-haired merchants of Boston, what they will gain by this procedure. 
Mr. Eddy was interrupted in his remarks by an outbreak upon the platform. The chairs were all thrown in a heap at the rear of the platform, and the people-women especially-crowded to the ends of the galleries-nearest the platform. And now the tumult waxed fiercer and fiercer; wild cries filled the air: Dr. Eddy. James Murray Howe, Question, Police,' and 'Take away the women, were heard from every quarter. The police, (some fifty in number) rushed upon the platform; the people jumped up on cushioned seats, regardless of the tender sensibilities of the superintendent; the reporters pocketed their notes, pushed away the tables, and sought securer places, and the indications of a savage fight were abundant. Douglass had taken the floor again, vainly attempting to be heard; Rev. Dr. Eddy vainly tried to gain the ear of the audience; a voice added to the excitement by calling out, John C. Cluer has threatened the lives of gentlemen present,' and moved that the police search Cluer's person for dangerous weapons. 
During the excitement, Dr. Knox, F. B. Sanborn and others, were violently ejected from the platform by the police. 
Cries for J. Murray Howe. 
Mr. Douglass attempted to speak again. 
Mr. Fay attempted to make him stop by persuasion. 
Douglass-I will not yield the floor. 
Cries-Police! Police! 
Chairman-I will put the question. He does not yield. 
Douglass-I will not abide the vote. 
The question was put, and Mr. Douglass was voted down for the second time. 
A motion was made to adjourn. The Chairman put the question. The meeting was declared dissolved 
Douglass-Good bye. Good riddance. (Three cheers.) 
Three cheers were given for the white slaves of Boston. 
Mr. Douglass-I call the meeting to order. Ah! you, (pointing out in the crowd,) I know why you are here-you are afraid of your Southern masters. 
Cries-Organize! Organize!
Douglass-Will our friends please to be seated?
Voice-You black fool, don't you know the meeting's dissolved? 
Another fight on the platform. Police attempt to clear the stage. One man knocked down (supposed accidentally).
Dr. Knox again gets in trouble, and is requested and assisted to leave the stage. He resisted.
Police took hold of Fred. Douglass, and said he must instantly leave. In the confusion, he slipped to the other side of the platform.
Sanborn-You will please take your seats, and come to order. 
Cries-Put Aim him out.
Mr. Sanborn was escorted off the platform by two police officers. 
An attempt was made to eject Rev. Dr. Eddy. 
Chief of Police-I am requested by the gentlemen here [Order! order! Order was soon restored,] to clear the stage. I ask the audience to retire. If you retire, you will stop the police from performing a very unpleasant duty. 
Voice-You cannot stifle free discussion in Massachusetts. 
Mr. Martin-You will come to order, and listen to Fred. Douglass. 
Chief of Police shook his head. 
On the right hand side of the Temple, a large number of women were gathered together, and were, apparently, much excited. 
Voice-This is a disgrace to Boston for the Chief of Police to clear the hall, instead of protecting the people in their rights. 
In the centre of the room stood several ladies, a young one attracting considerable attention by carrying on an excited and loud discussion with a Union man. 
Mr. Eddy said that the pro-slavery men came to the meeting only to disturb it. That is their purpose. 
Voice-It was all cut and dried. 
Voice-The moment I saw their faces here, I knew we would be interrupted. 
Mr. Martin-Ladies and gentlemen, you will now please come to order. The Chief of Police says we are to be protected in our discussion. I have the pleasure of introducing Mr. Fred. Douglass. 
Policeman attempted to collar Mr. Martin.
Cries-Order! Hisses! Chief of Police, put him out. Three cheers were given for the Union. Three cheers were given for Douglass. Three cheers for South Carolina. 
Douglass-I feel no more embarrassment by this uproar than if I had been kicked by a jackass. Three cheers for liberty. (They were given unanimously.) 
Three cheers were given for Gov. Wise. 
Cries-Packer's letter. 
Sanborn-Will the meeting come to order? 
Cries-No! No! 
Voice-Put him out. He is a white negro.
Sanborn attempted to speak, but was shown to the rear of the platform by a police officer. 
Three cheers were given for the South. 
Cries-Howe! Howe! 
Martin-We will stand by our rights. 
Cries for James Murray Howe. 
Voice-Why do not the Police do something? 
Nine cheers were given for the Boston Police. 
Another disturbance occurred on the platform. Everybody rushed to the platform, and a scene of the most intense excitement, continuing some five minutes, followed. One of the combatants showed his weapons. 
Cries-Put all the niggers out! All out! Blow them up! 
Mr. Martin-The Chief of Po-Great confusion.) 
Cries-Put him out! 
Cries-Go ahead! Howe! Howe! (Applause.)
Mr. Plunkett (received with three cheers,) moved that James Murray Howe be chosen Chairman of the meeting. He put the question. Carried. 
Three cheers were given for Howe.
Cries-Hats off. (Hats were taken off.) 
Mr. Howe divested himself of his coat, and went deliberately to work. He had but just taken his seat when a collision occurred between him and Mr. Fred Douglass. This caused an intense excitement, and there were cries of indignation towards Mr. Douglass, who attempted to speak.
Mr. Sanborn went to the front of the platform, and attempted to speak. He was seized, and chucked into a seat-rather forcibly. 
Mr. Howe proceeded to address the meeting. 
A gentleman seeing a vacant chair at one end of the platform, went over and got it. Mr. Douglass had been sitting in the chair. He rushed after the man, and as the latter was placing it in readiness for Mr. Howe to sit down, Fred grabbed the chair, and walked off with it. Several Union men made for him. A policeman grabbed him. Some one got him by the wool. (Cries-Wool won't save him.) A general fight occurred upon the platform, in which Mr. Douglass and some of his supporters upon the platform were roughly handled. They were forced from the platform, and many of them left the Hall. The Chief of Police called for order, and there was some talk of reading the riot act, but nothing of this sort was done, and the efforts to preserve the peace did not amount to any very strenuous attempts to remove the combatants. By request of the Superintendent of the Temple, the police asked the people to clear the Hall, and those who had taken possession of the meeting said they would go when all others did, and not before. Police were stationed at the several doors to prevent the entrance of such persons as they might see fit to exclude. Policemen were placed in the several aisles, and a dozen or two of them were upon the platform.
Chief of Police-Will the ladies leave the Hall? We give them five minutes. Then we will clear the Hall by police force. 
Cries-Women, don't go. No! No! 
The ladies on the main floor all took seats. Those in the galleries looked daggers. All seemed as though they were determined to resist to the last. They did not now appear greatly excited. 
Sanborn again appeared on the platform, and as he was commencing to speak, the Police seized him, and run him off the platform, hatless.
The platform was now cleared. Comparative quiet prevailed. 
Voice-Mr. Chairman, I move we now proceed to have a Union meeting in this Hall. Seconded.
The police went into the galleries, and attempted to clear it. The women resisted. 
Fred. Douglass returned to the Hall, when the mass arose from their seats, and angrily demanded 
<c05>
that he be put out. He was instantly surrounded by an excited crowd. It seemed that he was about to be subjected to violence, when it was announced that he was only looking after a portable desk, which he had left in the hurry of his former departure.
The desk for which Mr. Douglass was looking was soon found behind a pile of chairs, and was handed to him by a policeman. He remained upon the platform for sometime, freely expressing his mind, in the presence of a dozen or two persons who surrounded him. 
At one o'clock the crowd in the galleries was great. 
At five minutes past one o'clock, J. M. Howe came forward, took the chair, and read the call for the meeting. 
A large space about him was kept clear by the Police. 
Mr. Howe recapitulated what had been done, and the cheers which occasionally interrupted him, showed that the Union men were still preponderant in numbers. 
Some one called for the reading of the Union resolutions. The Chairman read them. 
Mr. Howe, in reading the call, said-And Hon. Henry Wilson-U.-S.-S. (Laughter. Hisses.) 
The Trustees of the Temple, accompanied by the Superintendent of the building, Mr. Hayes, and Mr. Martin, made their appearance on the stage.
The Chief of Police here went forward, silenced the noise, and announced that he had received orders from the Mayor to clear the Hall. 
Then followed a loud, continuous shout, and the Chief of Police, reappearing with a reinforcement of men, a shout went up-Down with the niggers! down on 'em! down upon 'em! put 'em out! 
Deacon Converse, one of the Trustees, said-We had no objection to the meeting being held, as long as it could be kept quiet and orderly. Now the house must be closed for the day, and for the evening. 
Mr. Howe-You have heard what has been said. The Mayor has ordered the Hall to be closed, and the Trustees are satisfied no meeting can be held. (Applause.) 
Voice-That's what we wanted. 
Mr. Howe-I recommend that we now adjourn. Carried. 
The audience straightway commenced leaving the Hal-the Police finding difficulty with some persons. 
Mr. Martin gave notice that a meeting would be held during the night in the Joy Street Church. 
At precisely twenty-five minutes to two o'clock, the Hall was cleared of all parties-except the reporters, trustees, officers of the building, and police officers,. About eighty policemen were present. The Hall was soon locked up. 
A large and excited crowd gathered in the street before the hall, where a small free fight was caused by a discussion about the election in the Fifth District. Cheers were given for Virginia, Freedom, Caleb Cushing, Banks and Hale. 

A POSTER. 
Shortly after the adjournment of the meeting at Tremont Temple, five hundred posters, of which the following is a copy, appeared conspicuously in the streets of Boston:-
'CITIZENS OF BOSTON!The sympathizers of JOHN BROWN say they will hold a meeting at Martin's Church, in Joy Street, this Monday evening, Dec. 3d. UNION MEN, SHALL IT BE ALLOWED? LET BOSTON SPEAK! 
The language of the above poster was naturally calculated to add fuel to the flame. Orders, therefore, by the Mayor for the Second Battalion of Infantry, Major Ritchie, and the National Lancers, Captain Fellows, to hold themselves in readiness for instant duty, were promulgated. Squads of police-men consisting of fifteen officers from each of the stations were instructed to protect the public peace in and about Joy Street Church, and the entire police force of Boston had their armor on (at the several station houses,) in constant expectation of a summons for their assistance. 
During the evening, thousands of persons gathered in the vicinity of the Church, discussing, vociferating, and yelling, according to their moods of mind. 

MEETING IN JOY STREET CHURCH. 
The church was filled to repletion, and would have been if it had been ten-fold its capacity. 
The meeting was called to order by Rev. J. Sella Martin. 
Frank B. Sanborn was introduced as Chairman. On taking the chair, he said it gave him pleasure to be present at this, what might be termed an adjourned meeting of the one broken up by Mr. Fay, as he believed it was. 
The organization of the meeting was perfected by the choice of J. H. Fowler and John Oliver as Secretaries. 
A motion was made by Mr. Martin, that a Committee on Resolutions be appointed. After a brief discussion as to the policy of offering any resolutions, the motion was carried, and Mr. Elizur Wright, Rev. J. B. Smith and Dr. Knox were appointed. 
Mr. McClure here arose and said that he wished to contradict reports in the public prints and elsewhere, that he drew a revolver at the Tremont Temple, and for the reason that he had none. All that he had were his own good arms. 
John Brown, Jr., of Ohio, was then introduced. He had, he said, come prepared to repel mob violence by, force, if necessary. If that meeting were permitted to be broken up, the fighting powers of the Abolitionists were greatly demoralized. (Applause.) Liberty of speech must be preserved, at all events. He hoped his life would never be saved by dodging his responsibilities. He had a speech prepared, and if they wished, he would deliver it. He then proceeded to read a speech on the question, 'How shall African Slavery be Abolished? He should address himself to those who believed slavery must and should be abolished. Mr. Brown then proceeded to allude to the aggressions of slavery, and the outrages it had committed. They had fought against this Slave Power, and had got to do it again. He recounted the hard-ships endured by freemen in Kansas. 
[A lady in the gallery here said that there were some persons in the gallery to break up the meeting. This created some little excitement. 'Put them out' was shouted in every part of the church. Mr. San-born begged the audience to be quiet. They had taken measures to preserve order.] 
Mr. Brown resumed his remarks, saying that they should be quiet, for there was true courage in this. Their rule should be acts, not words. Mr. Brown next proceeded to discuss the methods of abolishing slavery, among which was one that should make slave property as uncertain as possible. In relation to the free colored people, he said they should be thoroughly organized and armed. (Applause.) 
Of slave-catchers, he would take them-alive, if possible, but secure them, any way-and give them seventy-eight lashes; after which, he would have them washed down in salt and water. (Laughter.) Alluding to Gov. Wise, he said, 'My father forgives-so do I. He continued by urging a firm and courageous course against slavery. Their watchword should not be, Give me liberty or give me death, but Give me liberty, or I will give you death. (Applause.) In conclusion, he trusted that slavery would ere long be abolished. 
Elizur Wright, Esq., from the Committee on Resolutions, here reported the following:- 
Resolved, That the riotous interruption of a meeting this day assembled in Tremont Temple, to discuss the question of the Abolition of Slavery, by a mob of merchants and other evil-disposed persons, headed by R. S. Fay, Esq., who organized their raid outside, and stole into the hall while the meeting was being organized, trampling on the rights of those who had hired the hall, and called it, was a mean and unconstitutional, as well as an unmanly act, unworthy of Massachusetts and even of Boston. 
Resolved, That this cowardly act betrays the undoubted fact that these 'gentlemen of property and standing' have no arguments satisfactory even to themselves to urge against those who called the meeting, and who are the practical friends of free speech. 
Resolved, That the efforts of the mob to break up the meeting, in our opinion, would have been unsuccessful but for the Mayor's command to remove the friends of order and the originators of the meeting from the platform-by which act he became the real ringleader of the mob, and stands responsible for the destruction of the meeting. 
Mr. Martin moved that the resolutions be adopted.
Stephen S. Foster thought that part relating to the Mayor was too weak. The responsibility of the outrage to-day lay upon his shoulders. He had talked with many of the police, and they were heartily disgusted at the course he pursued. 
A Mr. Marble here eulogized Mayor Lincoln. 
Dr. Knox said that he knew certain things of Mayor Lincoln which he should like to state. He said that the Mayor had been represented as acting by advice of the Trustees of the Tremont Temple. 
Mr. Martin said that the Chief of Police had told him that he could not protect the meeting, and that he acted in part by suggestion of the Mayor. 
This, Deacon Converse denied. The speaker thought the Mayor did not desire to take any action in the matter. 
Mr. Hayes, Superintendent of Tremont Temple, said that if it had not been for the imbecility of the Chief of Police, the meetings would have been held forenoon, afternoon and evening, at the Tremont Temple. Six policemen could at any time have to stopped the disturbance. The police themselves were heartily ashamed of the affair.
<c06>
Wendell Phillips was the next speaker. On rising, he was received with prolonged applause and cheers. At its conclusion, he proceeded to speak. The meeting itself, he said, was a speech to which little could be added. This is Boston, which vindicates itself for two hundred years. They were profoundly grateful that when driven out of other places, they found a colored church. Just a year since, the speaker carried the remains of John Brown to their resting place. He was happy to say to North Elba that Boston welcomes his son. (Cheers.) 
Mr. Phillips next took up the subject of the Boston Mayoralty. We Abolitionists, he said, are, accustomed to live without a government. He did not remember a decent Mayor of Boston for twenty years. [Some one in the audience here hissed.] Mr. Phillips said that the right to hiss was as clear as to speak. With two exceptions, there was not a city north of Baltimore, in which Abolition meetings had not been broken up.
In alluding to the meeting at Tremont Temple, he said the rioters only were allowed to go free. He praised the prompt action of Mayor Henry of Philadelphia, when the mob attempted to disturb George W. Curtis. When asked what he would do with these disturbers, Mayor Henry replied, 'Send them to the watch-house'-a decision and a pluck he thought they would look for in vain in Boston. The speaker next proceeded to criticise with much severity the course of Mr. Lincoln during the day. Mr. Phillips was thankful that the meeting to-night was not governed by State Street. They had kicked South Carolina out of the Union, and set her cringing sycophants shaking. He thanked God Richard S. Fay was not a Boston man, nor was he a gentleman. 
Should it be said, he continued, that we are to surrender at home that which we ask our Representatives in Congress to carry out? If they could not have met in any hall in the city, they should have held a meeting on the Common. John Brown, Jr., had advised colored men to arm themselves with revolvers. This meeting was a revolver. 
In relation to the abolition of slavery, Mr. Phillips said he was in favor of all methods, but principally of free discussion. State street can't bear free speech, and that is what we want to give it. The smell of disunion is the jubilee of the slave. 
Again referring to the meeting at Tremont Temple, he said that men on State street, whose notes command thousands, had been guilty of meanly stealing the hall. 
Mr. Phillips concluded, urging the friends of freedom to continue in the good work, which was sure to triumph. 
The resolutions were then adopted. 
Frederick Douglass was then introduced. After the applause with which he was received had subsided, he proceeded to give some of his views as to the best method of abolishing slavery. He was in favor alike of peace and war, of union and disunion, (laughter,) of moral suasion and law. He advocated in particular the John Brown way. The speaker was sorry that Mr. Phillips was not present at the Tremont Temple to look Mr. Fay in the face. 
Brief addresses were subsequently made by Messrs. Parker Pillsbury and H. Ford Douglass, and Rev. J. Sella Martin. At quarter to 10 o'clock, the meeting adjourned with cheers. 
Up to this time, no acts of violence had been committed, but now, as if by a preconcerted plan, a brutal assault was made upon such colored persons as were peaceably retiring to their homes. Clubs and stones were freely used against them. Among those seriously injured were G. W. Crawford, Daniel Butcher, George Rhoades, Thomas Prout, George Roberts, and several others. Attacks were also made upon several dwelling-house, which were more or less injured. The windows of the Howard Boarding House, and also those of Gregory's Saloon on Cambridge Street, were smashed in. The Cambridge cars were, in several instances, beset in quest of colored victims, on whom to wreak their murderous hate. 
Glorious exploits these, Mr. Richard S. Fay!- Gallant achievements these, Mr. J. Murray Howe! 
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. This document was presented to Congress on Tuesday. We have room but for a few lines to indicate its character. On the important question now agitating the country, the President has much to say. He declares the North to have been the aggressor, and pronounces the Personal Liberty Bills of the Northern States unconstitutional. The right of secession is denied, and the perpetuity of the Union asserted, as the design of its founders. As a remedy for existing evils, an amendment to the Constitution is proposed, recognizing, first, the right of property in slaves in States where slavery now exists or may exist hereafter; second, the duty of protecting such rights in all the common territory, until the latter are admitted as States into the Union; third, a like recognition of the right of the master to recover a fugitive slave!!! This proposed remedy should at least be tried, the President says, before resorting to revolution. He then proceeds to speak of other questions, including our relations with foreign governments.

POETRY. 
For the Liberator.
'THUS SAITH THE LORD.'
Still I'm askingDid He say it?
Did our Father' ever say 
'Gird your swords, and each his neighbor, 
Each his friend and brother slay'?
Did He say to any father, 
'Slay your only, first-born son;
 Burn his body on the altar; 
Saith the Lord, it must be done?
Did He say to any people 
'I command you, go and kill
All the men of such a nation; 
Go, it is my holy will: 
'Only, spare the female children, 
And young women, for your lust;
Tis not sin when God commands it 
Thus the Lord saithgo ye must?
Homeward with their spoils returning.
Did God crave those spoils to share, 
one of each fire hundred cattle, 
Sheep, and maidens young and fair it;
Did He say'If one should gather 
Sticks upon the Sabbath day,
Stone to death the vile offender! 
Tis God speaks ye must obey'?
Did God fight one day for Israel, 
Make the sun and moon stand still, 
Cast great stonea from heaven, yet tell them, 
Solemnly, Thou shalt not kill;
In the Bible these are written
' God's own Book,' His Sacred Word':
Is it sin to doubt these horrors. 
After a Thus saith the Lord'? 
Still this heart of mine is asking, 
Did the Lord thus speak and do?
And forever comes the answer, 
'Never! never! tis untrue! 
So an Infidel' they call me, 
Taking Reason for my guide; 
Tremble for me, lest in judgment
I shall vainly seek to hide. 
Never care I, never fear I;
Loving God and all mankind, 
Heaven within, though hell surround me,
Happiness I still should find. 
In my heart I find it written, 
God's most true and perfect word; 
And the Conscience he has given 
Is to me 'Thus saith the Lord.'

OUR LIFE-WORK.
Do thy life-work calmly, bravely;
Ever trusting, press thou on; 
Never let its toils affright thee 
Rest at last will sure be won. 
Do thy work'tis God-appointed
It will lead thee up to heaven;
Tis the work which the good Father
Unto thee, his child, has given.
Never leave thou for another,
That which thine own hands should do;
When the voice of Duty calls thee,
To that call be ever true.
Though thy way be rough and thorny,
Twas the earth-path Jesus trod;
Shrinking never from its trials,
Doing all the will of God.
Think how calmly, and how meekly.
He, thy Brother, bore the Cross;
Counting every earthly treasure,
If twere gained by falsehood, dross.
Words of truth, most fitly spoken,
From his lips like pearls did fall;
Fearless still each sin rebuking,
Firm and just, and true to all.
If we would his footsteps follow,
He has told us of the way;
Shall we then eer weakly falter,
Or our holy trust betray?
While Humanity is pleading
For the fallen and the weak,
Fearless we must do our life-work-
Dare to think, to act, to speak.

The Reformed Drunkards Reply to one who
Urged him to Drink.
BY MOSS ROSE.
O, take the damning cup away,
Nor press it to my lips again;
And urge me not-for woe the day
I learned the fatal cup to drain!
My head is gray, but not by years;
My brow is lined, but not by time;
My eyes are dimmed, but not by tears;
Iam aged are my manhoods prime.
I drank-my child reached up his hands-
In pleading tones he asked for bread;
I gave him none-my fertile lands
A foreign strangers household fed.
I drank, and slept the drunkards sleep,
While pale in death my first-born lay;
And neighbors met his corpse to keep,
And wept beside that smiling clay.
And then that little bed was made,
With edges strait, and dark, and steep,
Far neath the beach trees leafy shade-
And still I slept the drunkards sleep.
And Mary faded-day by day
Her mild blue eyes were dimmed by tears;
Her golden locks were streaked with gray,
Long ere she numbered thirty years.
I knew her cheek was pale and wan,
I knew her days were full of pain;
And yet the demon lured me on,-
I quaffed the cup, and slept again.
And still that downward road I trod;
And when stern winter swept the world,
They broke for her the heavy sod,
And laid her neath the frozen mold.
Then take the damning cup away,
Nor press it to my lips again;
And urge me not-for woe the day
I learned the fatal cup to drain!
LOVE.
I think that Love makes all things musical;
I think that, touched by its deep musical breaths,
Our <Illegible> lives to blossoming lyrics swell,
And new births, shining upward from did deaths,
Clean dark glooms with white glories. Thus, to-day,
Watching the simple people in the street,
I thought the lingering and the passing feet
Moved to a <Illegible> of rhythm always,
And that I heard the yearning faces say.
Soul, sing me this new song. The very leaves
Throbbed grand <Illegible> of an <Illegible>
And when the warm shower wet the roofs at moon,
Low <Illegible> to <Illegible> down from the eaves,

THE LIBERATQR;
THE PAMINE IN KANSAS. 
NEOSHO FALLS, Woodson Co., Kansas, Nov. 4,1860.
Yesterday, the citizens of Woodson county assembled together for the purpose of devising means whereby they could keep their families from suffering and starving the coming winter, which is now close at hand; and the enclosed resolutions, after serious consideration, were unanimously adopted:- 
Whereas, by a most extraordinarily severe drought of more than a year's duration, our crops have been entirely cut off; and whereas, our former supplies being consumed, we were dependent for our support the coming winter on our crops, which have failed; and whereas, unless assistance comes from abroad, we must see our wives and children starve before our eyes, with no means of alleviating their distress; and whereas, no agent of the Aid Society now seeking relief for Kansas has visited our county to ascertain the wants of our inhabitants; therefore,
Resolved, That holding in remembrance the generous assistance rendered to Kansas: in former years, and believing that the people of the East are as ready and willing to respond to the, appeals of suffering humanity now as heretofore, we deem it our imperative duty not to remain longer silent, since every other source is exhausted, but once more to ask our friends to contribute to our aid something, though it be little and thus save from utter destitution many highly respectable, worthy and industrious families.
Resolved, That while we sanction and approve of the action of Mr. Hyatt and others in relation to the needs of Kansas, yet we believe that the scale upon which they are acting is so large that many of the most needy will escape their notice, and small places, like ours, will hardly feel any effect from their devotedness to the cause in which they are enlisted.
And be it further Resolved, That Mr. James Crane be requested, and is hereby appointed a duly authorized agent for Woodson county, to go East and solicit contributions of provisions, clothing and money; and we do earnestly recommend him to all persons generously disposed as one upon whose faithfulness they can implicitly rely.
These resolutions speak for themselves. The county of Woodson is pleasantly situated on the southern borders of civilized Kansas, and is a part of the land known as the New York Indian Lands, through which the beautiful river Neosho meanders, making it a most desirable location for settlement. These lands were not open for settlement by the U. S. Government until last June, and yet most of our citizens, being freedom-loving, brave and enduring, came from their homes in Iowa and Wisconsin, long years ago, to found an empire of freedom in the wilderness of Kansas; and you, having always watched their course, know with what result.
Most of the settlers here do not even own their farms, but hold' claims,' which they hope to pay for some time, if the Homestead Bill should fail to secure to them these their hard-earned homes.
Since September, 1859, up to the present time, there has not rain enough fallen here to wet the ground four inches deep; nevertheless, trusting in God and nature, and believing there is a time to sow and a time to reap, our farmers put in their fall wheat, which was killed in the winter. Not to be discouraged by this, the land was newly ploughed, and spring wheat and corn put in the ground in April. As the month of May was closing, the spring wheat was dead, and the corn, which had been planted early, had failed to come up for want of rain, and great consternation began to be felt by our citizens, who met together and considered what they should do, no one wishing to leave his home in this beautiful country, made dear to him from its having cost so much, and yet no other feasible plan seeming to appear- when on the last day of May it rained slowly nearly all day. Would that I could picture to you the happy faces of parents and children on receiving this blessing from heaven, and tell you how many hearts were lightened of a burden almost too heavy to be borne! Then might you have seen whole families at work in the cornfield, replanting the corn-land where it had failed to come up-and every little urchin large enough to carry a tin cup and drop corn, male and female, of high and low degree, from the youngest to the lowest, were in the field, doing their utmost to get the corn planted before the ground should dry.
From this time to the 13th of June we received several refreshing showers, and corn promised an abundant harvest, and all hearts were glad, and all hands were busy tending the crop; but, alas! as July came, the scorching sun and the withering south-west wind, too hot to be endured by man or beast, unaccompanied by rain, destroyed the corn crop which had promised so well. One more forlorn hope still remained. Buckwheat had never been known to fail, and now all the available land was sown to back wheat,. which came up, and for a time promised to do tolerably well; but want of rain blighted it, and its growth was so slow that all that lived, and would have produced, was cut off by an early frost.
Thus are our people left destitute of provisions, and with nothing with which to buy clothing for their families. Probably one half of the inhabitants of our county have gone back to their former dwelling places, and almost all who had teams or means with which to remove, are gone, leaving their three years' improvements behind them. How appalling must be the distress that would drive them to this sacrifice, and how deep must be the despair of those remaining here, which drives them to the only resource left them, of begging, and depending upon charity! Yet with a firm trust in the goodness of God and the humanity of mankind, they send their delegate forth to you to ask for alms.
The cast-off clothing of your citizens will be received with tears of joy by our shivering and ague stricken people.' Yes,' said one of our best and oldest citizens to me yesterday,' a half-worn coat would not be refused by any one; indeed, I should be. extremely thankful for one.'
Our children need shoes, and the half-worn shoes of your children, if sent to Kansas, would save many a little sufferer from an attack of fever and ague. Our men need boots and shoes, and so do our women, and clothing for their backs. We also must have money to pay the freight on contributions sent to us, and provisions to keep us from starvation.
We feel sure that we shall not ask in vain for these things, nor do we ask of any one much. Let each contribute his mite, and we shall have an abundance-and the blessings of a distressed and poverty stricken people shall be showered upon your heads.
'Friend of humanity, wait not, O, watt not, I beseech you, until the opened heavens shall flood the land with rains that shall add sickness to poverty! For then, what shall these poor people do? Delay not your work of mercy until drifting snows and driving sleet shall intensify suffering already too great to be borne. For the love of God, I pray you postpone not your philanthropy an hour. Believe me, there is no time to spare. Let not the wailing winds of March be the requiem of the dead who shall have perished for want of your timely aid.'
GEO. PORTER PAINE.
N. B. Mr. Crane, the delegate from Woodson county, will visit Boston, but will not have tune to remain to solicit contributions. Meantime, R. F. Wallcut will receive, at the office of the Liberator, donations of all kinds to await Mr. Crane's arrival; and may every person who reads the foregoing appeal contribute something, and rest assured that much good will spring therefrom-for it is written, 'Cast thy bread upon the waters, and thou shalt find it after many days.'

REPORT
Of an Anti-Slavery Convention at Mendota, III. In accordance with previous announcement, the friends of the slave met in Convention in Music Hall, in the town of Mendota, La Salle Co., Illinois, on Saturday evening, Nov. 10, 1860, and continued their meetings through the day and evening of the 11th.
The meeting was organized by the election of Mr. J. Pinkinton President, Dr. Wiley Vice President, and C. Tomlinson, Secretary.
C. B. Campbell, by request, opened the meeting with a song, accompanied by music on the melodeon. 
Parker Pillsbury then took the stand, and in a brief but forcible manner argued the necessity of continued anti-slavery effort; showing that the triumph of the Republican party had not rendered such meetings as the one we are now holding useless, but, on the contrary, of absolute necessity.
Mr. P. was followed by Mr. E. R. Brown, of this State, in a very appropriate discourse.
SUNDAY MORNING, Nov. 11.
Mr. C. B. Campbell, of Iowa, spoke at some length; enforcing, by facts drawn from various sources, the view that slavery must be abolished at no distant day, by peaceable means, or that it will ultimately go down in blood.
The following propositions, submitted by Mr. Pillsbury, and supported by him in an able speech, elicited considerable discussion, the opposition being, mainly, confined to the third and fourth propositions:-
1st. That American slavery is not only a great social, pecuniary and political evil, but also a heinous sin against God and humanity.
2d. That slaveholders, as such, have no rights more than other thieves, which any human being is bound to respect; and the fact that their outrages are perpetrated in the name of Government does not change their character.

3d. That a confederation and Union under which thirty-three States perpetrate piracy on sea, or robbery on land, is as much greater crime than thirty-three individuals committing such outrages, as the greatness of the power and the extent of the crimes committed.
4th. That the American Union is therefore an immorality that should never have been formed, and certainly should not longer be continued.
5th. That since the slaveholders themselves declare, and every sensible man knows, that slavery depends wholly on that Union for its perpetuity, it becomes the imperative duty of the non-slaveholding States, in the exercise of State sovereignty, to secede and form a new Northern and Free Republic, that shall be uncursed by tread of slaveholder or slave-hunter, and unstained by the blood of slaves.
6. That the Constitution and laws of Illinois, as they relate to the people of color, are cruel and proscriptive in the extreme, a scandal to humanity, and a disgrace to civilization.
7th. That the religion of the South, represented in the Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist and other denominations, tolerating and even defending slave-breeding, slave-trading and slaveholding among its ministers and members, is the worst form of practical atheism; and such ministers and churches in the North that fellowship them as Christians are in reality no more worthy of respect or confidence than themselves.
AFTERNOON SESSION. The discussion was resumed on Mr. Pillsbury's propositions; Dr. Adair, Mr. Kelsy and Mr. Philleo of Mendota, and Mr. Wm. S. Allen of Geneseo, in opposition; A. J. Grover and C. B. Campbell spoke briefly in favor of the propositions, leaving their support mainly to Mr. Pillsbury.
EVENING SESSION, The meeting was opened by an appropriate song from C. B. Campbell, with music on melodeon.
The following resolutions were read by C. Tomlinson:
1. Resolved, That the Fugitive Slave Law, in its requirements, is repugnant to the moral feelings of all who sympathize with the oppressed slave.
2. Resolved, That law or no law, Constitution or no Constitution, Government or no Government, we will not return to the demon of slavery the panting fugitive, whether the administration be Democratic, Republican, or any other.
Mr. E. R. Brown took the stand, and in an impressive speech, enforced the doctrine of No Union with Slaveholders.'
 Mr. Pillsbury followed with a touching appeal in behalf of the slave, and also of the free colored people of the North.
A few remarks were made by Wm. T. Allen, in which he urged the people (from a Republican stand-point) to a higher anti-slavery -life.
On motion of Parker Pillsbury, it was <illegible> to lay the foregoing propositions and resolutions on the table, and that they be published with the proceedings of the Convention.
On motion, the Secretary was authorized to forward the proceedings of this Convention to the Anti-Slavery Bugle, Salem, Ohio, and the Liberator, Boston, Mass., for publication.
J. PILKINGTON, President.
C. TOMLINSON, Secretary.
Numerically considered, the meeting was not large, but we trust an influence will go out from it that will be felt so long as a single slave continues to clank his chains, or a single being can be found to rivet the fetters on his limbs.

MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE.
MR. GARRISON:
The Liberator has been to me, for many years, a moral, social and religious teacher; and it has inspired me with a living faith to labor for the redemption of humanity, irrespective of clime, sex or complexion. It has taught me to encourage the freest utterance of thought and feeling, and that he or she who would limit the earnest soul in its searchings for truth is either a coward or a dishonest person. What was my surprise to read the statement, said to have been made by Mrs. Dall, that the women of Boston who were laboring for the elevation of their sex, had decided that it was premature and unwise' to consider the subject of marriage and divorce, and to see that C. K. W. recommends the lecture, and expresses a hope that lyceums will call for it? I say I was surprised-yes, I am disappointed if Mrs. Dall represents the so-called Women's-Rights women of Boston in that utterance. That Mrs. Dall as one claiming to be at work for her sex should entertain such an opinion is not at all to be wondered at; but that she represents the class of women in Boston known as reformers, it seems to me must be a mistake.
Why, the young women of some of these Western States have so long considered the matter, that they feel to entirely repudiate marriage until some slight sign of equality is visible, in such contracts at least. They believe that they see that the foundation of all rights for woman lies in her right to her own person. This right the present marriage relation knows naught of. They feel their only hope of redemption is in keeping out of that net, set by Church and State, wherein they lose all identity, and out of which they can never pass without committing some criminal act, or death comes and severs the man-made tie.
'Premature and unwise' is it to consider the condition from which, above and beyond all others, comes the highest happiness ever conceived of, or the deepest wo ever felt! Heaven help the women of Boston' to see what it is they would pass by without consideration! In that subject is involved the God-given right of woman to maternity; and when we consider that Mrs. Dall and those she represents would still give to a body of men the right to decide under what conditions she shall be true to her nature, I feel called upon to say that there are those who will not re- 
<co4>
cognize their power to determine that of which they cannot have the least conception. It is well known that nought but reproach, odium and contumely can come from the world at large upon one who resolves to live her or his own life, regardless of man-made laws; but the Father always tempers the wind to the shorn lamb, and in the strife to live the truth, as revealed unto us, comes the needed strength from day to day. We are, as it were, hedged round with a wall of fire impenetrable to all shafts of ridicule, scorn or contempt. Marriage in some form is universal and eternal as God himself; showing itself not only in the human, but in the animal, vegetable and mineral worlds. True marriage is the source of all unfolding; but that which cramps or fetters the affections is unworthy of the name, and belongs, where it is found, in the society where man rules. As I look at things, the affections are far above and beyond all legislation. Persons should be left free to unite as they please-to themselves to decide what is and what is not marriage-to marry permanently or temporarily-and to separate when they themselves feel called upon thus to do. I know that the world at large will see nothing but pollution and destruction in the path of such sentiments; but I thank God that the old doctrine of total depravity never got such hold of me as to render me blind to the tendencies of freedom and truth. So long as women and men need these man-made laws to govern their affections, so long, I believe, they will remain, and no longer. At the present moment, the right of a State to secede from the American Union is under consideration. I see not why a State or an individual who desires to withdraw from a compact should not have the right thus to do. I would have persons who choose enter the marriage relation as into any other copartnership, and if it be not for the interest of all parties to remain, let there be secession. So I say to-day to Alabama, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, if you don't like the Union, peaceably leave it.
When the American Union was formed, New York hesitated to join the confederation without the right to leave. ALEXANDER HAMILTON, in July, 1788, wrote to JAMES MADISON on the subject in these terms:-
'You will understand that the only qualification will be the reservation of a right to recede, in case our amendments have not been decided upon, in one of the modes pointed out by the Constitution, within a certain number of years, perhaps five or seven. If this can, in the first instance, be admitted as a ratification, I do not fear any further consequences. Congress will, I presume, recommend certain amendments to render the structure of the Government more secure. This will satisfy the more considerate and honest opposers of the Constitution, and with the aid of them will break up the party. 
Yours, affectionately, A. HAMILTON.' 
And here is Madison's reply:-
'NEW YORK, Sunday Evening. 
MY DEAR SIR: Yours of yesterday is this instant at hand, and I have but a few minutes to answer it. I am sorry that your situation obliges you to listen to propositions of the nature you describe. My opinion is that a reservation of a right to withdraw, if amendments be not decided on under the form of the Constitution within a certain time, is a conditional ratification; that it does not make New York a member of the new Union, and consequently that she should not be received on that plan. Compacts must be reciprocal; this principle would not in such case be preserved. The Constitution requires an adoption in to and FOREVER. It has been so adopted by the other States. An adoption for a limited time would be as defective as an adoption of some of the articles only. In short, any condition whatever must vitiate the ratification. What the new Congress, by virtue of the power to admit new States, may be able and disposed to do in such a case, I do not inquire, and I suppose that is not the material point at present. I have not a moment to add more than my fervent wishes for your success and happiness. The idea of reserving the right to withdraw was started at Richmond, and considered as a conditional ratification, which was itself abandoned-worse than rejection. 
Yours, JAMES MADISON.' 
As Madison said in the above reply to Hamilton, so does the Legislature of Massachusetts say now-that I must adopt the marriage law 'in to and forever. There are those not ready to do so-who prefer to be outsiders-to live their own lives, and, if need be, bear all the odium that attaches to such a position. 
To E. C. S., of Seneca Falls, I would express my thanks for the utterance of words which carry conviction to every liberal soul, and to PARKER PILLSBURY for his timely utterance in the same number of the Liberator. 
It seems to me that the subject considered premature and unwise by Mrs. D. and others is winked out of sight, kept under the curtain, completely swallowed up, and does away with the very being they would give education, vocation, civil position.' Some of the Women of the West feel that their womanhood can never be obliterated, and that it is eminently in season, and the highest wisdom, to consider that which affects their growth, and development through all time.

From the Harvard Magazine. 
MISS GILBERT'S CAREER.
This is a pleasantly written and entertaining novel, by one whose name is well-known to the public from other works, both in prose and verse. The scene is laid in the valley of the Connecticut, (near the northern Massachusetts border, we should judge,) and the whole book has an air of freshness which it may well have caught from that delightful locality. Of plot there can scarcely be said to be any; the story is rather a picture than a drama, with few complications and little mystery. The characters were perhaps drawn from real life, and are, at all events, natural and human. Those who are fond of tracing resemblances may, without impugning the author's originality, liken Arthur Blague to Nicholas Nickleby, with old Ruggles for a shadow of Squeers, and Leonora as the counterpart of Fanny S.; while Cheek, whose portrait is very cleverly and humorously painted, may suggest to the readers of the Atlantic the young man by the name of John.' Dan Buck is a kind of Alfred Jingle, Esq., though of a coarser and more villanous description. 
The aim of the book is to be deemed twofold. It seeks, in the first place, to show the injurious effects of the early and forced education of children; and, in the second, to maintain the propriety of woman's confinement to the domestic circle. As the title of the story imports, the latter is the chief purpose for which it was written. Probably no one will find fault with Dr. Holland's portrayal of the infant-school system of Crampton and its unhappy consequences, or with the obvious deduction he would have us make from these. Few, indeed, we are sorry to think, will take exception to the second and real moral of the story; but to us it is the weak and censurable feature of the book, deserving of an extended consideration, for the very reason that so many accept it without knowing or caring what they do.
We have said that the story of Miss Gilbert's Career is told for the purpose of maintaining the propriety of woman's confinment to the domestic circle. We must remark at the outset, that the author seems to have shunned criticism by the exercise of no little adroitness. When we say that the story aims to deny the right of woman to labor and to advocate her social and political rights in public, we are aware that the remark may seem unfounded to many who have followed the Career to its end. Why? Because the author, in wishing to affix a stigma to a good cause, inspires his heroine with a questionable motive for doing an act highly proper in itself, and then would have us condemn the latter, independently of motive, whenever the actor is, as here, a woman. In other words, Miss Gilbert writes a story: it is a failure. She has pluck, and she writes another: it is a decided success. But what is she alter? Is she obliged to write for her living? No. Has she some noble end in view,-the eradication of an abuse,-the elevation of her sex or of mankind? 0 no! She writes for the applause of men. She wishes to be famous, to have a Career. She is applauded; she is famous; she has a Career,-after some tribulation. But the applause becomes unwelcome, her modesty suffers from her notoriety; and her Career unexpectedly terminates 
<c05>
in her becoming the wife of a New York pastor, after she has purged herself of all masculine and unwomanly propensities. What is the moral? That women, as well as men, should not write for the sake of fame or for the gratification of vanity? Not at all. It is simply the reiteration of the advice of Pericles to the women in his funeral oration: She among you is the most honorable whom men hear of least for good or ill.' 
Let it not be supposed that we have attempted to draw a fictitious distinction; that we give the author credit for more subtlety than he exhibits. It is enough to answer, that the condemnation of the course of his heroine does not proceed from the inherent faultiness of her motives, and is not extended by him to the same conduct in the case of man. But, fortunately, the spirit of the book is apparent in more than one place, beyond all chance of doubt or mistake. Let us look at some of these passages: 
'"I wish to God I were a man!" says Miss Gilbert, talking with her father about her first novel; "I think it a curse to be a woman." 
"Why, Fanny!" exclaimed Dr. Gilbert, greatly shocked. 
"I do think it a curse to be a woman. I never knew a woman who was not a slave or a nonentity, nor a man who did not wish to make her one or the other. A woman has no freedom, and no choice of life. She can take no position, and have no power, without becoming a scoffing and a by-word. You have been talking to Fred ever since he was in the cradle about a career; you have placed before him the most exciting motives to effort; but you have never dreamed of my being anything more than Dr. Gilbert's very clever daughter; or a tributary to some selfish man's happiness and respectability. I say that I will not accept this lot, and that I do not believe my Maker ever intended I should accept it." 
'"Fanny Gilbert, never speak such words to me again, while you live. I will not allow it; I will not permit you to insult me, and disgrace yourself, by such language. I am astonished. I am confounded. I am-ah!-who has been putting such mischievous, such blasphemous, notions into your head?"
For 'Dr. Gilbert' read 'Dr. Holland,' and you have the author censuring what is really a very moderate statement of some of the wrongs of woman. As he does not attempt to refute it, however, we can leave Miss G. to conduct her own defence and that of her sex. Read the following, put purposely into the mouth of one of the most disagreeable characters, Mrs. Ruggles:-
"What is your notion about a woman's holding her property in her own right? I mean after she gets married, of course." 
"Arthur replied, coolly, that he trusted all married women who desired to hold property in their own right would do so, by all means. As far as he was personally concerned, while he would not blame a woman for having property, he should altogether prefer that she should depend upon him for support, rather than be independent of him."'-p. 110. See, also, p. 101, etc. 
Very condescending, is it not? in this young man not yet a minister. 'He would not blame a woman for having property,' but he would have her dependent on her husband. No qualification here for the possible character of the latter,-brute, drunkard, profligate, madman; no complaint for laws which open every married woman's purse to the rapacity of her master; no thought of the chances of the man's gambling away in stocks the support, the happiness, and, ultimately perhaps, the honor of his wife; no hint of beggary, and sudden reversal by the bankruptcy or death of him on whom the woman should depend. O Dr. Holland, how many poor women, who haunt by night the streets of the great city where Arthur Blague is minister of the Gospel, owe their wretchedness and their torment to the very dependency which you would encourage! 
"To me," says Miss Hammett," the idea of making my name public property,-of permitting it to go abroad as an author, subject to criticism, and to unjust and frivolous judgments,-the thought of being talked about in private parlors and public places, and of coining my heart's best emotions and my sweetest imaginations into words which the world can use as a glass by which it may read my life, is very terrible."
-p. 152.
We wonder whether Dr. Holland is troubled by the same sensitiveness. 
'He [Arthur] pitied any man who would consent to be known as the husband of an ambitious and bepraised notability. Mother Hubbard's dog was a very insignificant individual. Besides, he disliked a "blue," and not only disliked her, but was afraid of her.'-p. 310.
Here is a good example of the adroitness (far from praiseworthy) which we have already pointed out. For 'an ambitious and be praised notability,' read 'a woman superior to her husband, and celebrated for her abilities.'
Pages 244 and 379 contain very significant hints of the proper 'sphere' of woman,-the home circle, of course. One would think there were no unmarried or homeless women in existence. 
The unpleasant effects of Miss G.'s notoriety upon herself are described on pp. 388, 389. In travelling in the cars, she is so much stared at, that she is obliged to take refuge behind her veil. Those curious eyes invaded the sanctity of her womanhood.' Indeed! then Heaven repair the damages which the manhood of Baron Renfrew sustained in his tour through the States and the Canadas! Who is so obtuse as not to see that this vulgar curiosity is obtrusive and annoying beyond what marked men have to endure, precisely because book-writers and others are careful to brand as brazen-faced and ambitious those women who make the world acknowledge their humanity? If the relation of the two sexes were that of equals, Florence Nightingale or Miss Dix would be no more the object <illegible> impertinent staring than John Howard, or any other male philanthropist. While such is not the case, we have a right to say that Dr. Holland must be counted among the 'men with canes in their hands and cigars in their mouths,' who so rudely invaded the sanctity of Miss G.'s womanhood. We shall see further on, indeed, the character which the author allows to men of this description. 
Pages 411, 412, 413 are again an index of the spirit of the author. Miss Gilbert, to relieve her father from some of his burdens, becomes the 'accountant, farmer, and general manager of the estate,' with a success in the administration of affairs which 'was the marvel of all who knew her.' She looked after the cattle, and learned to drive the horses. What praise is accorded her? So much:- 
'He [Arthur] had been pleased with her efficiency in the service of her father, but there were displays of masculine tastes [videlicet, p. 450, her fearlessness, her self-confidence, her love of masculine, out-of-door life, her daring drives, and the genuine, business spirit with which she came into contact with men in the management of her father's affairs] that troubled him more than he would have been willing to confess.' 
-p. 413. 
We do not learn that the author or Miss G. was troubled by the feminine tastes which Arthur displayed in nursing and tending his helpless brother; neither is the question mooted of the comparative value of a divinity student and an agriculturist; but it seems to be assumed that, for a woman to do what a man can do, is to display a masculine taste,-wherefore, away with multiplication-tables and ledger! Why, then, does the author applaud the action of Miss Hammett, who runs away from her pater ardens' to become first a factory-girl, and then a school-teacher? Thank God,' cries Dr. Gilbert enthusiastically to her father, she is not a dependent!' Only think of it, Arthur Blague! She whom you loved and to whom yon offered yourself,-she who so lifted you above the level on which she found you,-she was not a dependent! Nay, but for the villain who robbed her, she might even have had in her possession a certificate of bank stock in her own right.' How masculine and unwomanly a woman is this! Why was Arthur attracted by her, and repulsed by Fanny?
One more quotation, and we have done. Arthur and Fanny are engaged:-
'Toward her new life, Fanny proceeded tremblingly. Her self-confidence relinquished, she turned to him to whom she had pledged herself for guidance and encouragement. She had lost her habitual self-seeking,-lost her imperious will,-gladly laid down her proud self-reliance, and found her womanhood. In after months and years, she learned, through feeding the springs of a man's power, enriching the food of his life, purifying his motives, encouraging his efforts, and filling his heart with love, what were her true relations to manhood. She learned that man holds in his constitution the element of power,-the basis of all demonstrative public function,-and that, by the degree in which woman possesses this element, is she exceptional, even if she be not abnormal. When her life had become fully blended into unity with his, she learned that a woman's truest career is lived in love's serene retirement,-lived in feeding the native forces of her other 
<c06>
self,-lived in the career of the husband.'-PP. 465, 466,467.
Here we get at the definition of womanhood; it is the absence of 'proud self-reliance' in a woman. Hence to Miss Nightingale, Miss Hosmer, Mrs. <illegible>,-nay, even to Miss Hammett herself, Dr. <illegible>, the fugitive factory girl,-no womanhood belongs. Genus hoc argumenti, attend quo serpet.
Woman's relation to man, too, is that of a supply-pipe to a reservoir,-a one sided arrangement which we have before noticed,-or, as it is afterwards expressed, her career consists in the discharge of this feeding process, while living 'in love's serene retirement'! The deduction is plain. Women should vote only through their husbands. But what if there is a difference politics between the twain? O, woman must increase the fuel! Timothy Titcomb, do you believe the Fugitive Slave Law would ever have been enacted, had woman had the right of suffrage? do you believe Fremont would have been defeated, if the women could have had a hand in the election of '56? do you believe we should have any dram-shops, if the wives of <illegible> husbands could sit upon juries, and make liquor laws to suit themselves?
See how skillfully the author words his claim of executive and legislative authority for man. Demonstrative public functions.' That means, 'sitting in General Court.' A woman who holds in her constitution 'the elements of power' is exceptional,' abnormal;' i.e., 'a female legislator, judge, or officer is a monstrosity.' But a home legislator is all right. In the parlor or the nursery a woman may try to influence her husband by speeches and arguments of any description, because she can often no opposition to what he is determined on doing; but in an assembly of her peers, where every vote counts, how easy it is to magnify the mole into a mountain,-the right into a monstrous abuse!
Such are the extracts upon which we rest our original statement, that the book we have been criticising is an attempt to frown down the revolution known as the Woman's Rights Movement in this country. Let each one judge for himself of its success. We commend to Dr. Holland, and those who agree with him (they are many enough), the little work of Mrs. Dall, called Woman's Right to Labor.' If they rise from reading it with the same feelings with which they sat down, it can only be that they have eyes, and see not.
Of the book as a display of the author's ability, we would say a few words. The opening of Chapter IX. may be cited as a specimen of Dr. Holland's descriptive powers, while pp. 209, 470, 471, and many others, will testily to his humor. We notice also a few defects. Pages 216, 217, 218; it is certainly a grave blunder to represent Arthur, the noble and high-spirited gentleman, as lowering himself to bandy billingsgate with a blackleg. It is no compensation, but rather an aggravation, to have the latter beaten at his own game. So the picture of two saints, p. 433, is by no means a pleasing one. They were 'specimens of Young America sanetified,-one of them a flashy gentleman, with a moustache on his lip, and a cigar under it, and the other an overworked, lean, wiry little man of thirty-five, prefaced by a violent diamond breastpin.' The likeness of these saints to the 'men with canes in their hands and cigars in their mouths' should not be overlooked. 'Moustache drove a very fine horse at home, and loved him.' Why may not Fanny be a saint as well, with the same penchant for driving? 
But, to our mind, the great defect of the book lies in the disposition which is made of the unfortunate Leonora. The poor girl, betrayed by a heartless scoundrel, and brought to the streets in New York, is dismissed in a single paragraph, with barely a sigh of commiseration. Yet what an opportunity for the writer! Suppose that Miss Hammett or Miss Gilbert had undertaken to recover the lost one, and to give her that chance to support herself by honest labor which would have saved her from her life of infamy. There was a career more noble than the one recorded of either, but both were strangers to it. Now remember, that in the great metropolis where Arthur Blague is minister, ten thousand Leonoras swarm by night like vermin, under the merciful cover of God's darkness. How shall we help them? 'Shut the door,' says Dr. Holland, 'if women ask to enter your counting-rooms. A female accountant is a monstrosity. Look to your fields, farmers of the Connecticut valley; a woman with a hoe is a man. Guard well the jury-box, Messieurs judges: a woman fit to enter there is an exception to her sex. Hustle her away from the polls, brave voters; what does she know of demonstrative public functions? and the traders, the farmers, the judges, and the voters do as they are bidden. Then God help Leonora!

DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
The following 'Declaration of Independence,' which we find in the Scranton Republican, enumerating the 'insufferable wrongs' and impositions practised upon Luzerne county by the rest of the State, completely 'takes down' the grandiloquent document sent to the President by South Carolina. We subjoin the declaration:-
A FREEMAN'S PROTEST. We won't stand it any longer. The freemen of Luzerne will not tamely submit further to the impositions of the rest of the State. We have already endured insufferable wrongs, and forbearance ceases to be a virtue. Inspired by the example of the great Whiskey Rebellion and the Buckshot War, we will resist the Commonwealth's exactions and bid defiance to its tyrannous rule. We will rend creation's fabric from turret to foundation stone, and pluck an additional feather from the tail of the American Eagle. Our whole history has been one of aggression on the part of the State. They interfered with our titles in the Pennamite wars, and made us pay twice for our land. They won't give us a Governor, though we have more than once asked it. They have never allowed us a United States Senator, though we have had plenty of patriots ready to serve their country. They have compelled us to pay our share of the State taxes. They doled out the appropriations for the North Branch Canal in beggarly allowances. They have run down our coal, and stigmatized us as a buck wheat district. They imposed an exorbitant charge on the New York and Erie for the right to cross our territory. They refused us their money for our railroads, and we were compelled to resort to New York, and the Delaware and Hudson and Lackawana and Western are the products of New York capital. They owe us nothing, and we do not intend to pay them. They sneered at our magnificent railroad, and said it could never ship 400,000 tons of coal a year. Ketcham and our representatives shall never serve. We will keep them at our own expense, and Hillman shall flourish on buckwheat cakes and molasses, and Pugh grow fat on sauer kraut and Welsh rabbit. We are in for direct trade with New York and the Beech Woods. Our interests are all in that direction, and we will cut loose from the rest of the State. We will stretch a big newspaper across the Nescopeck mountain, and guard the passes of the Pocono with a fan-tailed kite. Armed with a thousand pop-guns from Germany, and five hundred shawl pins from Connecticut, we will bid the foe defiance. The day of our independence draweth nigh, and our valleys shall yet be stained with the blood of the turkies slaughtered in honor of Thanksgiving. Hurrah for Luzerne and liberty!

HOLIER THAN THOU!
Mr. Wendell Phillips is certainly entitled to the sympathy of all kindly-considerate persons. He has made the Anti-Slavery reform what the advertising doctors call "a specialty." He is like a man who has invented a pill, and believes nothing in the world greater than his orbicular marvel of scammony and gamboge. He sometimes, reminds us of the dog in the Prologue of Rabelais. "Did you ever," says that facetious philosopher, "see a dog with a marrow bone in his mouth, the beast of all others, according to Plato, the most philosophical? If you have seen him, you might have remarked with what devotion and circumspection he wards and watches it; with what care he keeps it; how fervently he holds it; how prudently he gobbles it; with what affection he breaks it; and with what diligence he sucks it." Anti-Slavery is Mr. Phillip's bone; and no man can venture to indulge in a little philanthropy without provoking from that gentleman a sub-acidulous snarl. He dotes only upon those who disagree with him, and all his converts immediately become the objects, not perhaps of his jealousy, but certainly of his suspicion. He loves his enemies, because it is so delightful to pummel them, and he dilates with pleasure over some fresh and uncommon wickedness, just as a surgeon admires a large ulcer better than a cheek which health has incarnadined. D'Israeli says somewhere that the Jews shrink from a convert as from a calamity; and very good Abolitionists may be very good Jews in more ways than one. Mr. Phillips is a close communion reformer. You must take the wine out of his cup, or you shall not have a drop; you must receive the bread from, his plate, or you shall not swallow a scrap When you have confessed according to his prescription, and eaten uncommon quantities of humble pie, Mr. Phillips admits that you may possibly have a blinking idea of the sin of slavery, and just a little feeble and emotional desire to combat, it; but what he does not by any means admit is, that you hate it as he hates it, that you are sincere as he is sincere, or that you are consistent according to his code of consistency. He puts you instantly upon the defensive; he challenges your right to assist in the good work; he carps, sneers, and undervalues; and having quibbled you into the category of man-stealers, he makes cruel speeches about you, upon all possible occasions. A mind so warped and twisted, a judgement so inequitable and dislocated, a character so essentially and incessantly unamiable, is the more to be pitied, when traces of its original generosity are still perceptible, and when, in spite of its standing protest against being
admired, we cannot help admiring its better qualities. The contest in which Mr. Phillips has passed his life has been a cruel one; we wish, with all other sacrifices, that he had not felt himself obliged to sacrifice his catholicity and kindness of nature. A bigot of liberality, a sectarian anti-sectarian, a sour philanthropist, is not a pleasing object. Mr. Phillips should remember that hostility to human bondage cannot be monopolized by seven men in Corn hill, Boston; and that a Presidential Election is of more consequence in the world's turmoil than six "Anti-Slavery Bazaars," with a stock of virtu from the Duchess of Sutherland, and of ninety night-caps embroidered by the hands of Lady Byron herself. It is one thing to work actually in public affairs, and to have immediate, social results depending upon practical discretion and diligence; it is quite another to fight folly and wrong in the abstract, to be bold upon a platform, but never to be seen at a poll. The best philosophers become in time mere amateurs, and have no honors but, those of quotation. Gentlemen who begin by ignoring citizenship, are not the best judges of those who still recognize political relations. 
There is one ramification of Mr. Phillips's wellrooted spleen which perhaps we are not disinterested enough to consider with charitable equanimity. He is afflicted by a great and chronic grudge against newspapers; and we suppose that of the thousand sheets emitted daily or weekly in the United States, he regards as worthy of respect only two. For the Tribune we are sorry to notice that he has little affection; and it is really painful to observe what circuitous journeys he is, once or twice in a year, in the habit of making, merely that he may have his gibe at us. If any journal rises to the honor of being named in his speeches, it is always the Tribune; and the impression of us which any auditor would receive from these amiable allusions would be, that we are in conspiracy with Keitt, Slidell and the ghost of Mr. Preston S. Brooks to preserve the Union and postpone emancipation. We are, as a matter of good taste, almost defenceless against this kind of attack. It is not for us to say how much we have been enabled to do; how many minds we have convinced, or how many men we have led in the path of right action. But we have certainly the right as we have not less the inclination to speak for the general Republican press of the country; and to declare that in earnest and practical advocacy of the Rights of Man, and in educating the public thought up to a healthy abhorrence of Slavery, the Republican can newspapers have done and are still doing a noble work. Mr.Phillips, who knows nothing at all about the conduct of newspapers, cannot understand this. He has never used them. His experience of them is confined to the occasional contribution of half a column to the Liberator. When he was a very young man, all the newspapers were against him, and he fancies that they are all against him still. He lacks largeness of view to that deplorable extent, that he cannot conceive of a tempest on the outside of a tea-pot. A little Convention in a little village passing a little series of little resolutions, and just a little disturbed by the lewd and base, is to Mr. Phillips the most august of all possible human gatherings. He wastes upon a score of drunken rioters more indignation than he has to spare upon the assassination of a Senator. It is his misfortune, as it is that of the handful who concert with him, that they look at large events through the large end of the telescope; while, when little affairs are to be scrutinized, there is no microscope powerful enough to satisfy their appetite for magnificence. They cannot work conveniently except in a corner. The reform which is legislated-the ripe result of popular conviction demonstrated in the election returns-the hope of honest work initiated by an honest Congress, and consummated by an honest President-these are, according to Mr. Phillips, impossible. Everything must be done in the routine of a clique. You must subscribe for the Liberator. You must be mobbed twice in a year-once in New York, and once in Boston. You must think as Mr. Garrison thinks, and you must not think as anybody else thinks. If you are found faithful in these things, you are esteemed faithful in all.
It is, we confess, melancholy to find this poor result of really honorable and praiseworthy exertions. Something, we suppose, must be conceded to honest purpose; some allowance must be made for that infirmity of vision which follows too close a scrutiny of a single point. Very good men may work by for-
<c02>
mula, and work, alas! to small purpose. Our only doubt is, whether it is even worth while to try to put them right. Perhaps it would be most merciful to leave a mill-horse to stagger in his circle to the end; for he will fall down if he is taken out of it, and even if he should survive transplantation, he would be utterly useless for the plain and straightforward highway.-New York Tribune. 
THE SOUTHERN CHURCH.
Rev. W. O. Prentice, Episcopal rector at Columbia, S. C., has preached a discourse in favor of secession the fourth time, at the earnest request of the people, who do not seem to want to hear anything else. He proves not only slavery, but secession, to be scriptural, and draws a magnificent picture of the tranquility and glory of South Carolina out of the Union. One of the amusing things in the discourse is a version of the Lord's Prayer suited to Southern wants. The preacher said that the South, rich and poor, kings and paupers, poured out their petitions to the Almighty to "give us this day our daily cotton." 
The Southern ministerial view of the slavery question is given by the Rev. Mr. Fleming, as follows:-
"If slavery in itself is a sin, then Abraham, the father of the faithful, was a great sinner, for he owned hundreds of slaves. If it be the' sum of all villainies,' then many of the saints of the Old Testament and New were 'sinners before the Lord exceedingly.' And if to return a fugitive slave to his owner be a crime, then St. Paul, who sent Onesimus back to Philemon his master, and the angel of the Lord, who bade the runaway Hagar return to her mistress, were not guiltless. 
The Providence of God brought the negro to our shores; and whatever may have been the motives that influenced those who conveyed him hither, it is certain that his condition here is vastly better than it is in any other part of the world. Not only is he better fed, better clothed, better cared for in sickness and old age, and better loved by those he serves, than the laboring class anywhere else, but his moral and religious wants are better supplied. To him the gospel is preached, and his religious privileges are much greater than those of the poor laboring white man in many portions of our country. Sustaining to each other the relation of master and servant, a strong affection exists between us. I believe, before God, that not only the institution of slavery, but the preservation of the negro race on this continent, depends upon resistance, on the part of the South, to Northern domination. " 
The "irrepressible conflict" has invaded not only the churches, but touched the Bible itself. The 'Southern Bible Revision Association has withdrawn from co-operation with the Baptist Bible Union, because in the revised edition of Paul's epistle to Philomon, <illegible> The Tennessee Baptist says, "Just as certainly as immersion is the primary and proper signification of baptismos, slave is the meaning of doulos. It signifies a 'bond slave, a chattel,' strictly one born so. Wherever it is used in the New Testament, it requires this signification; any other destroys the sense. " 
DOWN WITH THE EVIL TREE. 
The irrepressible conflict has commenced in good earnest among the clergy. Rev. Mr. Vandyke, of New York, in a sermon printed in full, maintained the four following propositions:-
I. Abolitionism has no foundation in the Scriptures.
II. Its principles have been promulgated chiefly by misrepresentation and abuse. 
III. It leads, in multitudes of cases, and by a logical process, to utter infidelity. 
IV. It is the chief cause of the strife that agitates and the danger that threatens our country.
This is a regular clerical Paixhan! His introduction contains a classification of the preachers of this doctrine of Abolitionism into two divisions: those who denounce slavery at home, and those who act like John Brown; but thinks it don't belong to him to say which is the most heroic man. Mr. Vandyke says:-
"It is not for me to decide whether the man who preaches this doctrine in brave words, amid applauding multitudes in the city of Brooklyn, or of the one who in the stillness of the night, and in the face of the law's terrors, goes to practise the preaching at Harper's Ferry, is the most consistent abolitionist, and the most heroic man. It is not for me to decide which is the most important part of a tree; and if the tree be poisonous, which is the most injurious, the root, or the branches, or the fruit. But I am here, to-night, in God's name, and by his help, to show that this tree of abolitionism is evil, and only evil, root and branch, flower and leaf and fruit."
There is no namby-pamby here, verily: this goes to the root of the whole matter. This is the sort of talk the hour demands. All good parties should make it their chief business to hew this Bohon Upas down. -Boston Post. 
A CLERICAL DISUNIONIST.
Extract from a Thanksgiving (!) Discourse, delivered in New Orleans by Rev. William C. Dana, son of the late Rev. Dr. Daniel Dana, of late Rev. Dr, Danied Dana, of Newburyport:-
The same principles that impelled our great ancestors, in their day of trial, to shake off (not without sundering many pleasant ties of early recollection) a foreign and hostile government, now dictate the same course to their sons. 
Those States in which the dominant majority, whether from misguided conscience or party virulence, thus deliberately set at naught those provisions of the Constitution which were placed there as the special safeguards of the South, and without which the Union would never have existed-those States have no right to exercise one particle of sway over any Southern State. Not one of them ought to; have any share, directly or indirectly, in governing South Carolina. 
The Northern and the Southern States are, by their different institutions, so far distinct nations, that the possession of the Federal Government by a Northern political party implacably hostile to Southern institutions, and persistently reckless of constitutional restraints, is of itself the most odious and most dangerous form of foreign aggression; the most odious, because the forms of free government are made subservient to purposes directly antagonistic for which that government was constituted (a "more perfect Union"); the most dangerous, because that aggression is gradual, stealthy, insidious in its movement, so as least to alarm and arouse to united resistance those whose safety is threatened, whilst yet as long as nominal Union lasts, they are despoiled of their natural resources of defence. 
What a position for the South! To hang dependent on the justice, or the mercy, of a party foreign to her soil, and hating her institutions; and such a party, in respect to constitutional restraints, as this has shown itself to be!
What may have seemed, but fifteen days ago, a political heresy, is now a political axiom. "The South alone should govern the South." Only under her own protection are her rights and interests safe.

FREE SPEECH, PREE PRESS, FREE PULPIT.
The question of freedom, once started, is not restricted to one race or color. It instantly sweeps whites as well as blacks into its ample verge. It does not restrict itself, either, to the point of bodily servitude, but it forthwith comprehends mind, morals, religion, literature, speech, press, pulpit, up to the highest spiritual interests, and the loftiest thought, in its tremendous framework of iron. It follows the preacher to his closet, the artist to his studio, and the poet to his Parnassian haunt; and it lays its commands upon them, each and all, to pray, design, speak, sing nothing which does not square with the sentiment of the prevailing party, or say, mob. Is this freedom? Is this the boon our fathers came across the ocean to seek? Is this the sort of society Washington and his great compeers forecast? Is this chain, drawn around liberty of thought, opinion, expression, made out of the old muskets and bayonets that did such execution at Bennington and Germantown ?
The late outrages in Boston, and the threatened violence in Brooklyn and Philadelphia and New York, raise the question, Are the people in these cities free? or are they at the mercy of Judge Lynch, in the form of an irresponsible mob, either of "gentlemen of property and standing," or the refuse of society from Ann street or Five Points? We do not believe that those who thus trample the laws under their feet, and strive to put a chain on the tongue, the press, and the pulpit, know what they are doing. They do not see that they are giving the worst possible construction, in the minds of men, of the justice of their cause, by renouncing reason and right, and appealing to club law. They do not see that they are sowing the wind to reap the whirlwind. They seem to be judicially blinded to the fact, that by encouragement of the use of arms in the settlement of social and political questions, they are sowing broadcast the seed for a future crop of John Browns, and in fact, by their own example, justifying his appeal to the sword. They are John Browns on the other side of the question "Let these gentlemen of Boston know that their outrageous and cowardly assault upon the freedom of speech and of debate has stamped the fair fame of their city with a brand of disgrace which will be remembered for many generations. If it is said that the speakers were abusive in speech, let it be borne in mind that it is precisely such acts that exasperate the most extreme denunciators, and "make even wise men mad." Have we got to fight the battles of freedom all over again? Cannot citizens meet and freely discuss any subject in our country? Are we to have a censorship of speech, forum and pulpit? Is a reign of terror to be inaugurated at the North, as well as at the South! We do not believe a word of it? We have not the remotest apprehension of it in the world. But we are heartily ashamed that, at this time of day, and in the boasted Athens of America, the civil authorities should not have decision and firmness enough to say, "Liberty to speak, print and preach shall never suffer at our hands, in the good old Puritan city." We have committed to heart too faithfully the proud lessons of the olden time, the Miltonic strain of freedom, the liberty of conscience, the rights of Magna Charta, the sublime Declaration of 1776, to allow them now to be dragged in the dust at the heels of a mob, no matter whether that mob is dressed in rags or in broadcloth. Ill fares the day when any city parts with its manhood, its civil order, and right of free discussion, at the beck of any master, domestic or remote. We know full well that this freedom is unfortunately too often abused, but we cannot help that result. There is an unavoidable imperfection in the working of all institutions, but that incidental evil shall not justify us in abandoning the institutions themselves. A free press, pulpit, or lyceum may be abused. But we could not respect the preacher, editor, lecturer, or debater who spoke, or fore bore to speak, as "King Cotton," or any other authority dictated, not as his own individual convictions prompted him to speak. Life in America would soon become cheap and of little worth, if only those sentiments are allowed utterance which please the populace for the time being. We had rather remove to Austria, Russia, or Turkey, at once, than live in a society which should thus undertake, not to enslave the body, but to enslave the mind itself. Let us do penance by not reading the Declaration of Independence, or celebrating any Twenty-second of February, or Fourth of July, until we can better appreciate the spirit Of'76, and honor its immortal heroes.
But we have no fears. The mob spirit will find no favor, even in our most commercial and cottonized cities, among the great masses of our people, but a swift and sure condemnation. The schoolmaster and preacher have not been abroad in vain. We discern a vast but silent reaction taking place. Freedom, more than
Ever-a calm, just, constitutional freedom, is to take the control of our destinies. Men will say less about it, but they will do more.
If we are threatened with any more of these disgraceful scenes, we shall fall back upon the people, and we believe that the steam fire-engines and the metropolitan police will be able to extinguish any mobs which unscrupulous demagogues can raise. Or, if worst should come to worst, the mass of the yeomanry under executive authority would soon be able to control the worst localities, and to make it everywhere felt and understood, that the cause of law and order and freedom would be maintained, at whatever cost. As children of Washington, we are not going, in an idle caprice of fear or folly, to throw away the magnificent inheritance of constitutional freedom which he bequeathed us, and bow our necks under any yoke, foreign or domestic.-
Christian Inquirer.
FREE SPEECH
Suppression of the freedom of speech is the very culmination of tyranny. A denial of freedom of speech involves a denial of the right to think, freely and manfully, for one's self. Those who would fetter the utterance of a thought, would lay an injunction upon the formation of that thought, if they had power to do so. Out upon the craven hirelings who think to kill Truth by setting mobs upon peaceful assemblages of citizens convened in her name! What examples have recently been presented to the world of American manhood, culture, liberty and civilization! In Boston, a little handful of men hired Tremont Temple, and came quietly together, on the 3d of Dec., to discuss the great evil of slavery and the best means to secure its discontinuance in America. They are crushed out by a mob in broadcloth-violently hurled from the premises they had hired with their own money-hounded through the streets like miscreants-and their homes, in many instances, partially demolished by the rabble. On the Sabbath following, the congregation worshipping at the Music Hall were disturbed by riotous and clamorous interruptions; and on the Sunday follow-
<c04>
ing, Wendell Phillips, having addressed the people at the same hall, was escorted to the threshold of his residence by an armed police force, while a mob of hundreds howled along the streets, foiled of their victim. On the same Sabbath, Henry Ward Beecher preached from his own pulpit, while policemen were pitched within and without to ward off threatened violence. And in Philadelphia, Mayor Henry declines to allow Geo. W. Curtis to pronounce a literary lecture before an Association that had engaged his services! Such craven, toad-eating humiliation before the Cottonocracy of the South is disgraceful in the extreme. Is this the sort of manhood we inherited from our Pilgrim ancestry? Is this the progress we have made in our four-score years of national development and unfolding? Is this the way we hallow the memory of dead sires who laid down their lives in defence of freedom of speech and of opinion?
The Truth never suffers from the fullest investigation. On the contrary, it courts the fullest investigation, and claims it as a right. "Error of opinion may well be tolerated," said Jefferson, "so long as Truth is left free to combat it." Every man has a right to his own opinions, and to the expression of them. Each man claims this right for himself, and if so, he must freely accord it to all others. In admitting another's right to express his individual opinions, it by no means follows that you endorse those opinions. His opinion, may be false-if so, meet him with the force of logic and respectful argument: never with brickbats or blows.-Erie True American. 
THE MOB SPIRIT IN BOSTON.
It is to the burning disgrace of the Boston press that with at most a single exception, they have said nothing in reprobation of the mob spirit which has been recently manifested in that city. It is true that, on two occasions, the police of the city has to some extent protected obnoxious men in the exercise of their right to the free discussion of unpopular subjects. But this is not enough. It does not suffice for the papers to say as a sufficient extenuation, that the Abolitionists have had this protection. It is the spirit that requires the interference of the officers of the law, that needs to be reproved. And this the press of Boston has entirely failed to do, and so has come short of its high duties. While men of wealth and vaunted "respectability" have assumed to say that free speech shall be suppressed in Boston, and public meetings shall be summarily abated, while they have given countenance by their presence to the attempt to wrest the conduct of a meeting from the control of those that called it, while the baser mob encouraged by these fine gentlemen, has undertaken the dirtier part of the business, throwing stones, chasing and beating inoffensive negroes, filling the air with their cries for blood, and seeking to murder the leaders of the anti-slavery party, making the Sabbath hideous, the press of Boston looks quietly on, and has no word of reproof, of indignation, of instruction, of argument against the mob spirit. The papers fill their columns with accounts of the barbarous treatment of Northern men in the slave States, and are excessively shocked and indignant at it. But they have not a word against similar attempts right at home. What wonderful consistency! It is a pity they would not use the microscope as well as the telescope, and have something to say in reproof of a Boston as well as of a Charleston mob. 
The people cannot help drawing from this conduct the inference that there is very little real independence in the Boston press. It displays great enterprise in getting the news, but there its merit ends. It cannot be relied on for honest, persistent, unselfish adherence to principle and defence of popular rights. When the wealth and "respectability" (how we loathe that word in its present acceptation!) of Boston requires it to yield to the demands of expediency, of trade, of selfish interest, of the narrow views of the day, without regard to ultimate consequences, it has always been found ready to do so. It reflects accurately the opinions of a small but dominant class ever varying as that fluctuates, now loud-mouthed in pretended zeal for freedom, but the next day showing its insincerity and hollowness by an abject readiness to sacrifice all that it professed to have been struggling for. It is always engaged in a most painful attempt at preserving its equilibrium between opposing forces, and if any credit is due to the man who, by long continued practice, had acquired the power of standing on one leg as goose as a goose could, the Boston press is fairly entitled to the same.-New Bedford Republican. 
THE MOB AT MUSIC HALL.
We certainly cannot trust the keeping of free speech in Boston to the dictum of a mob. If men are to be punished or put in peril of person or life, for speaking boldly, or even madly, the experiment ought to commence in some other meridian than in the metropolis of New England. Mr. Phillips did not, in his wildest utterances, parallel that of a Senator from Georgia, who recently invoked in a speech, in his place in the U. S. Senate, the rise of a Texan Brutus to assassinate the Governor of Texas; and yet, for the venting of this murderous outbreak, we do not read that he was even so much as called to order! That was at the Capitol in Washington; this, that evoked a mob, was at the Music Hall, in Boston. The pen of History will note these things. -Christian Watchman. 
FUGITIVE SLAVE ACT-DISUNION. 
Whatever may be said of the opinion of the conservatives of the North, of the Constitutional obligation to obey the Fugitive Act of 1850, every thinking man admits that its requirements are unreasonable, in many particulars. A large class of our Republican politicians contend that such an act is not contemplated under the Constitution; but that the rendition of fugitives is a matter strictly belonging to the States; and, in pursuance of this idea, several of the Northern States have passed personal liberty bills, for the protection of their inhabitants. At this time, when the slaveholders of certain States are threatening disunion and secession, we find a proposition of compromise started, and indeed warmly pressed in the North, for the repeal of these personal liberty bills, to propitiate the Union men of those States, and appease the disunionists. Under this pressure, a bill has been introduced in the Vermont Legislature to repeal their Personal Liberty Act. But the telegraph tells us that they refused to repeal by a vote of 58 yeas against 125 nays. 
This looks likes decision; and we are strongly inclined to believe all the States having such laws will preserve them at all hazards. They may as well; for their repeal will not satisfy the disunionists, who demand the nationalizing of Slavery as their ultimatum. And further-these laws are an absolute necessity. But if we are to obey a fugitive slave act passed by Congress, we have an act to demand on our side. Art. IVth, Sect 2, of the U. S. Constitution says, "The citizens of each State shall 
<c05>
be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States." Under this clause we are entitled to an act to protect our citizens of the North in Southern States. As it is, a perfect reign of terror prevails in the Southern States; and no Northern man is safe in those States, be he there from what motive or for what purpose he may. To of be a citizen of a Northern State is to be an outlaw. The same men can go into any other government on earth, and their citizenship will protect them. Can they not have the same right at home-in their own country, under this guarantee of the Constitution? The power of the Nation has been put forth to retake a fugitive slave, and men have been persecuted and hunted by the officials of the General Government, for doing an act of humanity, of Christian charity, because it was forbidden by Slavery. In justice, we now demand that an act be passed by Congress and enforced by the Executive, for the protection of the personal liberty of persons who are so journing in States of which they are not citizens. Let such an act as this be passed, and faithfully executed, and the Fugitive Slave Act might be more tolerable. But to ask us to suffer our free territory to be made the hunting ground of the arrogant bullies of the slave interest; to be called out to play the blood-hound at their beck, and persecuted for disobedience, while we dare not pass over the line of a slave State for the most laudable purposes, is more than we either can or will stand. 
If the spirit of the free North is not wholly crushed out, it will be folly to talk of compromise with the South on any such basis as is talked of. Justice between the States must be respected; and the rights of the citizens must take precedence of all else. If the slave party cannot submit to right and justice in their commonest forms, they must be made to. If the power of the Nation is only to be put forth to sustain wickedness and oppression, it is time for the Nation to yield up its existence. But there is no such alternative presented. The Nation has the power to preserve its integrity, and the Union can be preserved. And better still-the people have elected men to do both; and the Union is to be preserved in its integrity and honor. Secession must be put down. It is easier to permit it; but the higher duties we owe to humanity and our own interests, and to the patriotic men of the South, require that it shall not be. The malcontents who talk of secession must be subdued-and we believe Old Abe has the grit to do it. We know, if he has not, his party has the grit to leave him-Ashtabula Sentinel. 
RENDITION OF FUGITIVES. 
It is as much a matter of regret, as of astonishment, that Northern journals claiming a respectable degree of candor and fairness, should be so ready to recommend concession to the insolent demands of Southern fire-eaters, that we shall repeal the laws that have been passed by several of the free States to protect their citizens against the outrageous provisions of the Fugitive Slave Law, while not a word is uttered in relation to the villanous enactments which preceded the existence of that most abominable statute, incarcerating the citizens of other States guilty of no crime, unless to have a black skin is a crime, and compelling their employers to pay their board or permit them to be sold into slavery, and to hire their slaves to do the very work their men might and should have done. Not a word do these journals have to say about this violation, not only of the Constitution of the United States, but of justice and humanity. 
It seems to us these fire-eaters should first begin the work of conciliation, and wipe their statute books clean of all their unconstitutional acts, purge the Fugitive Slave Law, passed at their behest, of its outrageous and insulting provisions, afford the same protection to Northern men going South that Southern men enjoy North, and a general reformation of their manners and morals, before asking anything of us. They are not the men, with the history that they have left behind them, to ask us to recede, or propose measures of conciliation. 
If the concession is to be all on one side, and the North called on merely to bow down to the demands of the Democratic leaders of the South, and the doughfaces of the North, we fancy it will require a good deal more than threats of dissolution to bring the people to it. It is quite unendurable enough to see these men lord it over the negroes, without submitting to the same treatment ourselves. It is quite bad enough to submit to the rendition of a fugitive after he has enjoyed all the benefits of the forms of law in defence; but repugnant as this would be, such is the respect for law, that the people of the North would bear it. But to see a man, though black he be, seized like a dog, and on testimony not sufficient to establish a claim to the smallest pecuniary value, dragged into perpetual bondage, the men of the North will never submit to, and they ought not. Let the South pay some decent respect to the moral, religious and humane sentiments of the North in doing an odious thing, and not attempt to trample under foot and spit on all this, and on our persons, too, in pursuit of their chattels human, if they mean to get along peaceably in the abominable work. Then we can turn our backs and shut our eyes on the detestable thing because it is law, and executed with the least possible offence; but we must be permitted to hate the whole thing with our whole heart, soul, mind and strength. This is the least we can ask. If, in addition to this, we are to be forced, under pains and penalties, to hunt their slaves for them, betray them when they come to our dwellings for food and protection from an iron despotism, shut our bowels of compassion against their entreaties, it may be written down as certain, that the decent men of the North will never submit to it, though the heavens fall. The unrighteousness and the humiliating character of the deed are too great to be endured by any one having any sense of justice or any manhood left in him. We are not yer all of us such slaves or heathen as this, however it may be with the whiskey-drinking and debauched politicians and their tools-Maine Temperance Journal. 
MRS. H. B STOWE ON THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 
We think no State paper so remarkable has ever appeared from a Chief Executive in this country-perhaps in any other country.
The cool, decisive manner with which the President, all through a certain
portion, identifies himself with the Southern States, and speaks with perfect naivete to from their point of view, is the first striking feature. 
The coolness with which he turns round upon the Northern States, and charges upon them the whole guilt and responsibility of the extravaganzas now going on in the South, is another feature.
The coolness with which, from first to last, he ignores the existence of any moral and religious sense as forming any component element in regulating national movements, is another and very striking one. "The fool hath said in his heart, there is 
<c06>
no God," said David in his time. David had not seen the bottom of atheism. The fool he speaks of had, it seems, raised the question. It had occurred to him as a possibility. It was left for the nineteenth century to show a specimen of a State paper, proposing to a Christian nation to become, more formally than ever they had been before, robbers, kidnappers and pirates-without betraying through a line that a God had ever been heard of in America-unless it be in certain customary rhetorical phrases at the close. 
The South is all in an uproar, he tells us-they cannot sleep nights for fear of servile insurrection, and, of course, somebody is to blame for this, and something most be done. Who is to blame ?
There are four million men and women-some of them black, and some of them white-whom the Southern law, systematically, and with logical accuracy not to be misunderstood, has stripped even of the name of human beings, and declared not persons but things; they cannot sue or be sued-they cannot buy or sell-they cannot own a foot of land-they cannot form a legal marriage-they cannot own or educate their own children-their family loves are all accidents of bargain and sale-they cannot learn to read or write-they cannot raise a hand against the will of any white person who may choose to insult or dishonor themselves, or wives, or children, on pain of death; and yet, among this mass of struggling, repressed human life, are multitudes of men-more vigorous, physically, than their masters-with all the energy given by the constant habit of work-with all the fire and pride which comes from being born of white fathers; and, thus repressed, the South herself is constantly tampering with and stimulating them to insurrection.
What are these madmen now doing, as they sit on their powder magazine, and fire hot shot to right and left ? 
In the theatres of South Carolina, they are singing in the ears of an impressible, nervous people, who are quick to catch both tune and words, that furious Marseillaise which seems to breathe the very roar of a wild and angry mob of barbarians. They forget who listens while they sing:-
"Oh! Liberty, can man resign thee,
Once having felt thy generous flame?
Can dungeon bolts or bars confine thee,
Or whips thy noble spirit tame?"
Is it credible that these words can be allowed to go ringing and echoing in the ears of plantation slaves? and then is the North coolly to be told in State papers that the South cannot sleep for fear of servile insurrections, and that it is her agitation on liberty that is the reason?
?
It is not the fault of the South-no. It is not the laws which forbid marriage which agitate-it is not the rending of families which agitates-it is not exposing four million human beings without legal protection to any insult which four million others may devise that agitates-it is not forbidding education and improvement which agitates-it is not the having a class of white sons and daughters in their houses, whose talents and beauty are marketable, and who with all the pride of their masters, are exposed to all the insults of the slave-it is not this that agitates! 
It is not that with all this outraged, struggling, abused mass around, they go round roaring the Marseillaise in their ears, and advertise them in public speeches and private conversation that Lincoln's election is likely to break their chains, (we wish it were.) It is not the murderous, brutal barbarism which tars and feathers, burns alive, hangs up without judge or jury, and afterwards tries, which causes excitement. No; none of these tend to servile insurrection-not a bit of it-it's the North; the wicked, truculent, horrid North, who are constantly declaring things they have no business to in sermons, magazines, poems, and speeches. 
The North keeps expressing an opinion on such delicate points as adultery, robbery, piracy, kidnapping. They are not convinced yet, and don't seem likely to be, that these are reputable courses. The North will hold that a man is a man-that all men were created free and equal, and have equal rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
The North holds that it is wicked to forbid marriage to a whole community; that men ought to have rights to their wives; that it is a shame to sell children from their parents' arms; that it is a greater shame for a man to sell his own sons and daughters. They have these opinions in common with all civilized nations, and mean to act upon them-and the President thinks it is the defending of such ideas as these has made all the difficulty. 
The remedy he proposes is quite as remarkable. He says, "After all, the Constitution gives only such an ambiguous foothold to this state of things, that it is impossible to convince the majority of the North that it supports them all The way to do is to alter the Constitution of the United States so as fully, freely, and clearly to admit and legalize slavery, and agitation will cease."
Agitation cease! It reminds us of an anecdote of an old black slave-woman calling herself "Sojourner Truth," who sat in the front ranks once in an Abolition meeting, when Frederick Douglass, fired with the wrongs of his race, and the despairs of the white race, declared that there was neither hope nor help for the slave but in their own right arms. In the pause that followed this appeal, Sojourner lifted her dark face, working with intense feeling, and said, in a low, deep voice, which was heard in every corner of the room:-
"Frederick, is God dead ?"
Let that old black slave-woman's question ring through this nation, as then it rang through Faneuil Hall. To all who hope or dream to put down agitation by a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell, old Africa rises, and raising her poor, maimed, scarred hand to heaven, asks us-"Is GOD DEAD?"-New York Independent. 
PLATFORM OF THE PEOPLE'S PARTY.
SPEECH OF HON. JOHN HICKMAN.
Last evening, at 8 o'clock, a "social re-union" of the People's Party operatives had a public dinner at Samson street Hall. About three-hundred persons were in attendance. Most of them were well-known Ward politicians, and some of them hold prominent Municipal offices. 
The first toast, "The Memory of Washington," was drank in silence, the whole audience standing. There was no verbal response. The second, "The Union and the Constitution," was responded to by Hon. John Hickman. The mention of this gentleman's name exacted great cheering, prolonged through several minutes. He said:-
Mr. President, and gentlemen of the People's party of Philadelphia; I thank you for the opportunity you have afforded me, for giving expression to my devotion to the Constitution and the Union. I love the Constitution because it secures the Union, and I love the Union because it gives to us security and prosperity. Without them we should fall into anarchy; 
The United States Constitution is "a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell."
"What order of men under the most absolute of monarchies, or the most aristocratic of republics, was ever invested with, such an odious and unjust privilege as that of the separate and exclusive representation of less than half
a million owners of slaves, in the Hall of this House, in the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential mansion? This investment of power in the owners of one species of property concentrated in the highest authorities of the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of the twenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privileged order of men in the community, more adverse to the rights of all, and more pernicious to the interests of the whole, than any order of nobility ever known. To call government thus constituted a Democracy is to insult the understanding of mankind. It is doubly tainted with the infection of riches and of slavery. There is no name in the language of national jurisprudence that can define it-no model in the records of ancient history, or in the political theories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. It was introduced into the Constitution of the United States by an equivocation-a representation of property under the name of persons! Little did the members of the Convention from the Free States imagine or foresee what a sacrifice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of this concession."-JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.

and worse, without them brother would be arrayed against brother, and blood would run down the streets of your beautiful city. 
It is not necessary for me to declare to you, who are apprised of transpiring events, that they are both in danger, and that neither of them will be preserved by paper resolves. The time has rather arrived for action than expression. No man can maintain the integrity of this Union by popular assemblies, declaring devotion to the Constitution. The time has come when every man has got to define his position in the great struggle which is about to come off between rival sections and rival interests. No greater truth was ever proclaimed in the hearing of the American people, than that there is an antagonism between freedom and slavery. [Applause.] And let no man console himself with the reflection that this antagonism is to be quieted by the palliatives of compromise [A voice. Or by public meetings.] You cannot form truces between them, which will last. It is as impossible as to dam up mighty rivers, and to say that from such a point dry land shall appear. As long as the free sentiment of the North shall invade the territory of the South, so long the South will have complaints; and you have now to make up your minds whom you will serve-whether you will serve God or Belial [Applause.]
This is not the first time in our history that these difficulties have come upon us, and when the safety of the country has been imperilled. In 1820 we compromised, in 1832 we compromised, in 1854 we compromised for the purpose of making peace between these rival and conflicting interests, and in every instance in which compromises have been entered into, these compromises have been followed by increased difficulties and dangers. And now it is proposed to us. with all the experience of the past, that we shall again endeavor to make a lasting truce between freedom and slavery. I have said at another time, and in another place, that air lines may divide rival States, but they can never bound conflicting sentiments. The lights of the press, the waves of proficient craft, the mechanical tendencies of highly productive art-these will always make an impression upon the weak and the impotent. My fellow-citizens, I put it to you, sober, staid, sensible men, to give to me if you can, the lines of compromise which shall give to us rest. Will you restore the Missouri Compromise line [A voice, �No"] enacted in 1820 at the demand of the South, and repealed in 1854 at the same demand? Will you reenact it again? [A voice, �Not by any means."] Not by any means. No, I would rather suffer my right arm to be severed from the shoulder [cheers] than place upon myself any such mark of humiliation and disgrace. [Renewed cheers] Are you willing that this game of battledore and shuttlecock shall longer be played between the South and the North? If you are, I am not, and the line is drawn between us as distinctly as it is drawn between the North and the South. [A voice, �He's exactly right," and cheers.] As for myself, I say it here, and I say it distinctly, desiring not to be misunderstood by any, man-and you will find I will carry it out through my life-no more compromise. [Cries of �Good," and vociferous and long-continued applause.] I love the Constitution and the Union equal to that of any other man. [cheers,] but I will not buy them from any man who does not exclusively own them.[" Good," and cheers.] If the Constitution and the laws will not secure the fealty of every right-minded citizen, is it to be expected that a flimsy compromise, patched up by members of Congress, is going to do what they cannot effect? My motto is, �Millions for defence, not one cent for tribute." [Cheers.]
It is proper, my fellow-citizens, that we should look at the realities of the times. South Carolina declares that she has already seceded from the Union; that the bonds have been severed which bound us together. I contend that if South Carolina is out of the Union, there is no State in it, [cheers.] for there is not vitality or power in the bonds which we supposed held us. But I give it as my opinion, as my conviction, that she is not yet out of the Union, and I also give it as my conviction that, with the blessing of Almighty God. she never will be out of the Union. [Tremendous applause and wild enthusiasm.] If you feel as I do, I know she will never be out of the Union [cheers]; and I repeat to-night what I have said on a former occasion, that the eighteen millions of the North, the toiling millions who monopolize all the art, industry, and intelligence of the country, are not to be overcome, paralyzed and moulded into shape by eight millions without these auxiliaries.
But, my friends, we have fallen upon evil times. I would not magnify our danger, nor would I in any way diminish the aspect which it presents. We have already arrayed against the Union a sovereign State. We have the sympathies of five or six other States so far extending to South Carolina that, in my judgment, they are ready to join her at any advantageous moment, and I am by no means certain that all the border States will not be found in affiliation. We have, in addition to this, a traitor President, [loud cheers] a corrupt and rotten Cabinet, [cheers] and for aught I know, we may have the regular army against the Union, inasmuch as the President is the commander-in-chief of that army; but I declare to you my solemn conviction, to-night, that with all these fifteen States, this Federal Administration, and the army and navy banded together, the mighty millions of the North will defend and save the Constitution and the Union. [Cheers.] If I did not believe so, I should despair of my country, for I look at this thing as I know that; it exists�-I should despair of my country, and I would cry aloud to my God,� Oh! give me a city of refuge!" 
What is your determination? You have declared for the Constitution and the Union. How do you hope to save them? There is, in my judgment, but one way known under Heaven and among men, by which they can be saved; that is, by such an expression as will go out from this hall to-night, that banded treason, no matter how strong, shall not destroy them. ["Good," and cheers.] Neither merchants nor manufacturers, however respectable they may be in town meeting assemblies, can do anything for the cause which we have at heart, and much less can they give us safety by a truckling, mean, dog-like subserviency to the South. [Cheers.] The day will come to all such men, and it will come quickly, too, when they will call for the mountains to fall upon and hide them from the gaze of their fellow-men. [Cheers.] These are the men who would bind the Constitution and the Union by tape and bobbin. They have offered their price to the South, and we have seen how the South has spurned them. The only plan to save the Constitution is by a union of hearts and of hands, [cheers] of resolute, determined men, who will meet the last issue. [Cheers,] I do not doubt that I speak very far in advance of the sentiment of the times. I have never measured my expressions by present prevailing opinion, nor do I intend to do so now. I would not degrade myself by appearing before any body of men in Christendom, to express opinions which I know are false. [Cheers..] I tell you that the South believe that the North is craven, and those men, to whom I have alluded, have but afforded them stronger ground for this belief. [Cheers.] I want to know of every man I meet, here or elsewhere, if he belongs to that body of men, or whether he belongs to another. I want to know whether he is going to purchase peace by meanness, by betraying his own people and his own interests, or whether he is going to defend the peace. [Cheers.] My fellow-citizens, the Constitution and the Union should be upon the lips of every man, and the Constitution and the Union should be defended by the valor of every man. ["Hurrah! and cheers] Unless you think as I do-unless you speak as I do-as sure as we have met here to-night-the Constitution and the Union are lost forever. [Cheers.] And I call upon you to save them. I call upon you to muster all your manhood, and to meet the issue, not that you have framed, but which the South has forced upon you. To meet it boldly and determinedly, not defiantly, and if you shall do so, you will have the satisfaction to know your country is again safe. [Cheers.] And soft as the tones of the seraph, yet loud as the thunder of heaven, the cry shall come from the sentinel on the watch-tower of liberty, "God prospers the Republic. All is well!"
The applause during Mr. Hickman's remarks was, at times, deafening. When he uttered the sentiment of �no more compromises," the shouts were tremendous; cheers rang confusedly up; the whole house stood. The sentiment relative to South Carolina's inability to go out of the Union was received with even more applause, if that were possible. The denunciation of the President and Cabinet was greeted with an approving storm. So the allusions to the duty of the people, and the strong anti-slavery sentiments at the speaker, were tremendously cheered. 
The third toast was the �People's Party of Pennsylvania." responded to by a speech from Wm. B. Mann The great �hit" in this speech appeared to be the denunciation of Mayor Henry. That gentleman was groaned by some enthusiastic persons, and the shouts of applause were deafening. He said:�
<c02>
He was no advocate for force, except as the last dread arbitrament. He would bear with his brother to the last moment. He sought no war against them. There was no feeling in the North of hostility to their Southern brethren. The North had no desire for war, but if it is forced upon us, then the feeling here must be unanimous that no traitor must be allowed to breathe in Pennsylvania. [Cheers.] He did not believe there was a citizen of this State who voted for Mr. Lincoln, who would refuse to battle for the Constitution and the Union. In regard to the matter of force, that was discretionary with the constituted authorities. When called upon by them, let the people respond. Prior to such call, it would not become members of the People's party to make offensive threats, or to boast of their strength and power. The country and its resources were known; from the Atlantic to the Pacific, thousands would be found ready to perish in obedience to the call of the officials. The mighty army of the North was capable of defending the interests of its section. It was against all history for a Southern nation to encroach upon a Northern one. It was for the interest of both North and South to keep the fraternal tie permanent, that all the people might be protected. Tear it asunder, and the world would not know a period of equal violence. The tie was not yet destroyed. Not withstanding the deeds of these Palmetto people, the Union was yet intact. Their Commissioners had not been recognized by the President, who, it was possible to hope, might yet prove himself to be something of a man. Mr. Mann then related a remark which Mr. Douglas had made in the President's hearing, relative to the sterling virtues and courage of Andrew Jackson: �He is dead!" How sad it was to know that his olden worth had no place in the heart of James Buchanan! He (Jackson) would have clutched rebellious Carolina as a steel glove clutches a handful of hornets. Jackson had regretted to the day of his death that he had not quite enough law on his part to enable him to hang Calhoun. He was a soldier and a man of action. Mr. Mann paid a copious eulogium to Gen. Jackson. The spirit of Jackson still lived, and was ready to act. The People's party would preserve the Union as it had preserved the city and the State. It would give justice to the South with an open hand, and was a conservative party, which would, nevertheless, yield no single right fought or voted for.
Spirited speeches were also made by J. R. Flanigen, Esq., David Newport, Esq., John E. Latta, Esq., Dr. Frank Taylor of Chester County, Gen. William F. Small, Mr. Charles Wilson, and others. 
[Philadelphia U. S. Gazette. 

AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP. 
Mr. Buchanan, in his Message, appealing to the people of the Union, says:-
"But I may be permitted solemnly to invoke my 
countrymen to pause and deliberate before they determine to destroy this, the 
grandest temple which has ever been dedicated to human freedom, since the world 
began. It has been consecrated by the blood of our, forefathers, by the glories of the past, and by the hopes of the future. The Union has already made us the 
most prosperous, and ere long will, if preserved, render us the most powerful nation on the face of the earth. In every foreign region of the globe, the title, of American citizen is held in the highest respect, and when pronounced 
in a foreign land, it causes the heart of our countrymen to swell with honest pride." 
It was one of the boasts of the Roman State, when in the height of its grandeur and power, that the solemn declaration, �I am a Roman citizen," was a protection in foreign and barbarous lands. Cicero, in his great invective against Verres, the tyrant of Sicily, made it an aggravation of his cruelties, that he had disregarded this plea of Roman citizenship. St. Paul, at Jerusalem, made the same effective appeal:-
"The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know wherefore they cried so against him. 
And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, 'Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?' 
When the Centurion heard that, he went and told the chief Captain, saying, 'Take heed what thou doest, for this man is a Roman.' 
Then the chief Captain came, and said unto him, 'Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, 'Yea.'
And the chief Captain answered, 'With a great sum obtained I this freedom.' And Paul said, 'But I was free-born.' 
Then straightway they departed from him, which should have examined him; and the chief Captain was also afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him."-Acts XXII, 24-29. 
Such was Roman citizenship and its immunities, even in Judea, eighteen hundred years ago. Mr. Buchanan extols the power of the United States and the value of American citizenship abroad. There is something to predicate such a boast upon. It is not many years ago that Capt. Ingraham (a native of South Carolina.) nearly plunged the United States into a war with Austria, in behalf of one Kozta, an Austrian subject, not even a citizen of the United States, but who, having declared his intention to become so, was sojourning in Asia Minor. The country sustained even that arrogant pretension, so jealous are we of any aggression upon the rights of American citizens. 
Within no very long period past, the case of naturalized American citizens travelling in their father-land, and there held to supposed claims to military services, attracted much attention. Their rights were vindicated, after considerable doubt and hesitation on the part of our Government. 
We suppose there can hardly be a doubt that if, in any country of Europe, or even in the Barbary States of Africa, a single citizen of our country were seized and subjected to torture or other indignity, instant redress would be demanded, and insisted on; that without such redress there would be just cause of war, and actual war waged with our might. Were he so seized and maltreated, upon the ground that he was an American, and was in favor of American institutions, there would be no bounds to the universal indignation. 
Suppose the Rev. Dr. Cheever (a well-known clergyman now in Europe ) should be there arrested and lynched, by hanging on a tree, for no other offence than because he is an American-would it be passed by in silence? A government which fails to protect the lives of its citizens, and their persons from insult, even by arms if need be, has no rank among the nations of the earth. It would be idle for a foreign power to say, this was the act of a lawless mob. We should reply, �Have the perpetrators been brought to justice?" Happily, however, it is true that citizenship of the United States is respected in all foreign countries pretending to civilization. 
How is it in the States of our own Confederacy? The newspapers daily give us accounts of the maltreatment of American citizens upon American soil. Throughout the cotton States-indeed, in several of the border or breeding States-the life of no Northern man is safe. The merchant from the North-the preacher of the Gospel from that section-the teacher, male or female�the traveler for health or business, is in much greater danger than he would be among the Bedouin Arabs, or the roving tribes of Sahara! So frequent have these cases become, that every day brings us new ones, often with some new form of atrocity and barbarism. Not a citizen of Ohio to-day can travel in the cotton States, and register his name and address, without exposing himself to scourging, tar and feathers, or hanging. It is only a few weeks ago that Stephen A. Douglas and his wife were pelted with eggs at the State Capitol of Alabama. Not to be forgotten either, is the hanging of the Rev. Mr. Bewley, in Texas, now authentically known; this, for no crime, no misdemeanor, but simply because he was a preacher of the Gospel, and came from a free State. It would require columns to enumerate the cases where the parties are known, and the facts unquestionable. We have not chosen to fill our paper with stories of hangings and minor tortures,-of the driving men away by brute force, because of simple Northern birth. They are wearisome and painful reading; humiliating to every man who calls himself a citizen. 
Such is the value of citizenship at home, and under the flag of the Union. It will be said, all this is in violation of the laws of those States-the work of lawless men or mobs. True; but we have yet to see the first offender punished. Nay, we have yet to hear of the first attempt on the part of State authorities, to bring such offenders to justice. Lawless these crimes are; but those who administer the laws silently sanction, or expressly approve them. 
Such is the immunity of our boasted citizenship at home, and on our own soil. Is there not food for reflection in facts like these? Are offences against rights so sacred, more venial when committed by Americans, than if they were committed by Algerines, or by the barbarous islanders of Australasia and Polynesia?-Ohio Beacon.

The Liberator.
No Union with Slaveholders! 
BOSTON, FRIDAY, JANUARY 4, 1860. 
SPECIAL NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBERS.
Delinquent subscribers for the past year,-that is, from January 1, 1860, to January 1, 1861,-are respectfully requested to remember our STANDING RULE, by which their papers will be discontinued after February 1,1861, unless payment for the same be previously sent in. We shall be extremely sorry to lose a single subscriber in this manner, especially at this crisis in our national affairs; but, as our printed terms indicate that payment is to be made in advance, we are sure if, instead of rigidly exacting it, we allow (as we do) a credit of fourteen months to delinquents, they can have no cause of complaint when their papers are stopped for omitting to make settlement; yet, with all this indulgence, we have known various instances in which such persons have taken this treatment almost as a personal affront! What ideas have they of the sacredness of contracts? And, surely, our subscription list is always too limited to make us willingly lose a single subscriber. Exceptional cases there will be, calling for special consideration; but it is absolutely necessary that we should abide by the rule we have laid down, to prevent losses which cannot be borne.

ANNUAL MEETING. 
The Twenty-Ninth Annual Meeting of the MASSACHUSETTS ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY will be held at the TREMONT TEMPLE, in Boston, on THURSDAY and FRIDAY, January 24th and 25th, commencing at half past 10 o'clock, A. M.
The members and friends of the Society are urgently requested to make the attendance on their part larger than ever before seen since its formation. In view of the position of the Anti-Slavery cause, and of the state of the nation, it will be the most important anniversary the Society has ever held. Troublous as is the aspect of things, it is a sure indication that the cause of impartial freedom is moving onward with irresistible power, and that the day of jubilee is rapidly approaching, to be succeeded by universal joy, peace and prosperity. For nothing disturbs the repose, deranges the business, assails the interest, dishonors the character, and imperils the existence of the republic, but 
SLAVERY. Freedom, and the love of it, and the advocacy of it, and the uncompromising support of it, without regard to color or race, can never work ill to whatever is just, honest, noble, humane, and Christ-like. It is not the Abolitionists, who simply espouse the cause of God's poor and needy and oppressed, that it may go well with our land, but the Southern slaveholders and slave-breeders, who traffic in human flesh and enslave even their own blood-kindred, and who hate every thing that savors of liberty, who have brought the nation into its present distracted and distressful condition; for theirs is the spirit which chooses� rather to reign in hell than serve in heaven." 
Come, then, friends of freedom, to the Anniversary, strong in the righteousness of your cause, serene and undaunted in spirit, and resolute in your purpose to seek the speedy removal of the cause of all our national suffering and danger! 
Able and eloquent speakers will be present as usual. [The list will be given hereafter.]
In behalf of the Society, 
FRANCIS JACKSON, President. 
ROBERT F. WALLCUT, Secretary. 

THIRTY YEARS COMPLETED. 
We have completed thirty years of editorial life connected with the Liberator. We commence a new decade with the same confidence in the principles we espouse, the same assurance of success in the cause we advocate, that we felt at the commencement of our labors,-only greatly strengthened by the experience gained, and the progress made toward the goal of final victory. It has been a long, desperate, and (humanly speaking) most unequal struggle with the organized religious sentiment, the political power, the combined wealth, the recognized respectability, the popular feeling, the business selfishness, the satanic malignity, and the universal brutality and ruffianism of the country; but, from the hour the bugle of freedom first sounded its notes in favor of immediate and universal emancipation, the movement has advanced with slow but irresistible power, under Divine guidance, confounding the wisdom of the wise, contemning the might of the strong, taking the cunning in their own craftiness, unmasking the hypocritical, swallowing up all the rods of the magicians, breaking sects and parties into fragments, vanquishing all opponents, its poverty more than a match for all the wealth of the land, its conscience outweighing Church and State, its spirit sublime and unconquerable, its truths self-evident, and its results glorious in the annals of historic achievement;-and still, 
"Against the wind, against the tide, 
It steadies with upright keel," 
outstripping all competition, and with the haven of righteousness and peace full in view. 
For thirty years, we have been the target of popular scorn and violence, for imploring the nation to �undo the heavy burdens, break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free�!
For thirty years, we have been ignominiously branded as heretic and infidel, disorganizer and fanatic, because we have declared chattel slavery to be diametrically at war with the spirit and teachings of Christianity, and that into the true Church enter neither the enslavers nor despisers of their fellow-men! 
For thirty years, we have subjected ourselves to outlawry in all the slaveholding States, and have had no common country to recognize our rights and accord to us equal privileges, because we have maintained that liberty ought to be� proclaimed throughout all the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof"! 
For thirty years, we have been held up to public abhorrence as a monster of iniquity, and represented as quite unfit to live, because we have� remembered 
those in bonds as bound with them," refusing to compromise their cause, and carrying out in their behalf the Golden Rule! 
For thirty years, the Abolitionists have been mobbed in city, town and village-misunderstood, misrepresented, calumniated, caricatured, ostracised-injured in business, and cut off from all preferment-because they have endorsed the language of JOHN WESLEY, that �Slavery is the sum of all villany," and believed with THOMAS JEFFERSON, in regard to the enslaved at the South, that �one hour of their bondage is fraught with more misery than ages of that which we rose in rebellion to oppose�-and trembled with him, when they� reflected that God is just, and that his justice cannot sleep forever�!
The �head and front of our offending," and of theirs, �hath this extent-no more." 
So stands the record of impartial history. 
But the Anti-Slavery cause being of heaven, not of men, and guarded and defended by the arm of Omnipotence, no weapon formed against it has been able to prosper. In vain have been, and will be, all compromises between the North and South. The �irrepressible conflict" sweeps every thing before it, and laughs to scorn the fulminations of priestcraft, and the devices of political tricksters. All Union-saving efforts are simply idiotic. At last,�the covenant with death� is annulled, and� the agreement with hell� broken-at least, by the action of South Carolina, and, ere long, by all the slaveholding States, for their doom is one. �The dissolution of the Union is� the abolition of slavery," said Mr. Arnold, of Tennessee, in the U. S. House of Representatives, a few years ago. Hail the approaching jubilee, ye millions who are wearing the galling chains of slavery; for, assuredly, the day of your redemption draws nigh, bringing liberty to you, and salvation to the whole land!.

LETTER FROM DR. A. BROOKE.
MARLBORO', Ohio, Dec. 14th, 1860.
MY DEAR FRIEND,-Your remarks upon the late mob in Boston, in the Liberator of the 7th, include the following passage:-
"It was our impression that the Convention would prove comparatively a failure, as the Call did not emanate from a source calculated to carry any personal weight, and as no conference or consultation whatever was had with the long-tried advocates of the anti-slavery cause, who, if they had been consulted, would have suggested a very different mode of procedure, and who had nothing to do with it directly." 
Inasmuch as you acknowledge �the right of the young men," alluded to, �to call the meeting in their own way," is there not something needlessly ungracious, to say the least, in such a remark, under the circumstances? While perilling much in a struggle for free speech for all, and smarting under undeserved violence, was it wise towards our cause to enter a disclaimer of any part of their course, which could not be condemned as a moral delinquency? Is there not reason to feel encouraged by, and to encourage every evidence of uncompromising hostility to slavery, whether the actors in it pronounce our shibboleth, or ask our opinion of the �how to do it," or no? 
Yours, with true regard, A. BROOKE.
REPLY. We deem it neither unfair nor improper to �let every tub stand upon its own bottom," or to state facts truly as they exist. The reason why we used the explanatory language, referred to by Dr. Brooke, was, that the meeting at the Temple was falsely represented by the press and telegraph to have been a �Garrisonian" convention, and especially under the guidance of Mr. Phillips and Mr. Garrison, who were taunted with cowardice (!) by the Courier for not having been present. While we shrink from no responsibility of our own, we are not willing to have that of others thrust upon us against our consent. We fully vindicated the right of those who called the meeting at the Temple to do so, against all disorderly interruption, and have ever since been assiduously endeavoring to deepen the infamy of those who riotously broke it up, by recording our own views, and the sentiments of various manly journals in different parts of the country. We still think, however, that it would have been not only courteous, but judicious, on the part of the young men who signed the call, to have conferred directly with those older in the struggle, as to the best mode of procedure upon an anniversary calculated to arouse the demon-spirit of slavery, far and wide. There can be no good objection to� personal weight," or to the presentation of the most influential names, when these can be obtained in the cause of ostracised liberty. Nevertheless, it is for each and all to labor as they may. Our only aim was, to make a simple explanation in order to correct a wide-spread misrepresentation. What would have been a comparative failure, has resulted in a meeting for the whole country, commanding millions of hearers, owing to the efforts of Messrs. Fay, Howe, and their mobocratic associates. So kind Heaven-
"From seeming evil, still educes good."

FAMINE IN KANSAS. 
With all the relief that has yet been extended, the famine in Kansas continues to be sorely felt, and thousands are in a state of destitution closely bordering upon starvation. The number is estimated at thirty or forty thousand. This is truly appalling; for they can realize nothing for themselves until another harvest. On our last page, we give a highly interesting letter from Mr. R. J. Hinton, dated� Atchison, Kansas, Dec. 20, 1860," in which some painful and heart-moving facts are communicated respecting this terrible visitation, and a strong appeal made to Eastern benevolence, which we are sure will not be made in vain. The most reliable arrangements have been made in the Territory to sacredly and judiciously distribute the charities given, according to the necessities of the parties presenting themselves for relief; so that there need be no apprehension on that point. Think of a bare-footed population in the inclemency of winter, to say nothing of rags instead of clothing for a covering! 
Below is a private note from our esteemed friend, Col. Whiting of Concord, Mass., characteristic of his spirit, which we publish in this connection as an incentive for others to �go and do likewise." Blessings on the heads of the juvenile benefactors in Concord of the suffering people in Kansas! 
CONCORD, Dec. 16,1860.
DEAR FRIEND,-Reading in the Liberator of the 7th inst. an affecting account of the sufferings of the people at Neosho Falls, Woodson County, Kansas, I thought it would be well to read it to our Sunday School, which I accordingly did. We then and there voted to take up a collection on the 16th inst. It amounts to $10.62. It would have done your heart good to see the bright eyes of the dear little children sparkle when the amount collected was announced to them, because it is so much more blessed to (be able to) give than to (be obliged to) receive.
May God in mercy grant that every one who has the means may be kind and generous to the poor sufferers, not only in Kansas, but wherever they may be! 
Yours, truly, WM. WHITING.

FUGITIVE SLAVES AND THE LIBERTY ACT. 
NUMBER I.
There will, undoubtedly, be an attempt made, in this State and the other States, to repeal the so-called Liberty Act, with a view of conciliating the South, and preventing its secession. It has been stated in the newspapers, recently, by high legal authority, that, the Liberty Act of this State is unconstitutional,-as conflicting with the National Constitution,-and for this reason should be immediately repealed. How this may be, I do not know, and I will not undertake to call in question the legal opinions of men so eminent as lawyers, as many of these gentlemen undoubtedly are. 
I take, however, an entirely different ground from them, and would prevent the execution of the Fugitive Slave Law, whether it is constitutional or not, and whether the Liberty Act of this State is a violation of this provision of the National Constitution or not. 
The ground I take-and I think it is an impregnable one-is, that the States had no right to make this provision a part of this Constitution, nor adopt it; and that it is entirely null and void, as such. I will now endeavor to prove the position I thus take. And to do this, I will review the decision of the Supreme Court of this State, in the case of the slave Med, which came before them more than twenty years since, and which decision was given by Judge Shaw, in his own language. I say, then, that there is an evident inconsistency, in principle, between the law as it was decided by the Court in that case, in reference �to slaves brought here voluntarily by their masters, and the law in relation to slaves who are fugitives from other States, under the provision of the National Constitution. In the former case, the Court decided that they are entitled to their liberty immediately, and in the latter case, that they must be returned back again to a state of slavery. To perceive this inconsistency in principle, we must examine the ground upon which they are declared to be free when coming with the consent of their master, and see whether these grounds do not equally apply when they are fugitives from another State. The Court, in giving their opinion in that case, say:-
"Without making inquiry further, it is sufficient for the purpose before us, that by the Constitution, adopted in 1780, slavery was abolished in Massachusetts, on the ground that it is contrary to natural right and the plain principles of justice. The terms of the 1st article of the Declaration of Rights are plain and explicit,-'All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, essential and inalienable rights, among which, are the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberty, that of acquiring, possessing and protecting property.' It would be difficult to select words more precisely adapted to the abolition of negro slavery." 
Now, if these were the grounds upon which slavery 
<c05>
was abolished in this State, and can no longer exist here, why do not they apply as well to fugitive slaves as any other? Why is it not as �contrary to natural right and the plain principles of justice� to hold them in bondage, or return them to bondage, as slaves who have come here by the consent of their masters? These principles apply to the system of slavery in itself, and not to the mode by which they same into the State. The rights of the slave must be the same in both cases. 
But in reply to this it may be said, that, in the case of fugitive slaves, the State of Massachusetts has, by adopting the National Constitution, bound themselves to recognize slavery in the Southern States, so far as to deliver up fugitive slaves when claimed by their masters, but have not bound themselves to deliver up slaves who come here under other circumstances. But the question recurs again, what right have they! to bind themselves by adopting a Constitution containing such a provision �against natural right and the plain principles of justice"? What right have they to assume dominion over the lives and liberty and welfare of a race of men who were not parties to this Constitution, and who had no voice, either in fixing its provisions or making the laws under these provisions-who were not represented in the Convention that framed it, or in Congress who made laws under it? If there is any truth in the assertion made in the Declaration of Independence,� That all just laws proceed from the consent of the governed," they are certainly not bound by these laws, for they never gave their consent to them in any manner, either directly or through their representatives. And I would further ask, what right had the States to bind themselves by an instrument, which, under certain circumstances, requires them to rob a fellow-man of all his rights, personal, domestic and civil, and to reduce him again to the condition of a brute and a chattel? If they have no right by the Constitution and laws of Massachusetts, grounded upon �natural right and the plain principles of justice," to deprive a fellow-being of all his rights, and treat him as a slave, they have no right to become parties to a National Constitution which is intended to produce this effect. This principle will apply to the one as well as the other. 
But it is said by the Court, in this case, that the Constitution of the United States partakes of the nature of a treaty between foreign powers, and that it would be perfectly competent for one foreign power to stipulate by a treaty to deliver up the fugitive slaves of another foreign power. This position of the Court I would respectfully dispute. In my judgment, it is never competent for one foreign power to bind themselves by a treaty to do that to another foreign power, which the party stipulating confesses will, in its consequences, lead to something �against natural right and the plain principles of justice." If it were competent, it would be competent for a nation to do what is an acknowledged wrong, and a violation of justice. 
The plain distinction in the case appears to me to be this: that though a government has no right forcibly to interfere with the laws or institutions of another State, within that State, though such laws or institutions may be unjust and oppressive, yet it ought not, in any way, to cooperate with the other State within its own jurisdiction and territory, in the support of such institutions and laws. It is not bound to reform and purify the laws or institutions of another State of their injustice and evils, except by the exercise of a moral influence; but it is bound in any way to execute these laws, or uphold these institutions, within its own dominions. It is not bound to make other nations do right, but it is obliged itself not to do wrong. 
Again: see the absurdity which follows from considering a man a slave who comes into Massachusetts as a fugitive, and a freeman when brought here by his master. In the former case, he is considered a mere chattel-a movable-personal property attached to his master, which may be reclaimed as a stray horse. In the latter, he is considered a freeman, entitled to all the rights of a freeman. Yes, the same individual, having the same natural rights, which he has never forfeited or transferred, is to depend for the character, in which he shall be treated, whether as a horse or a man upon the <illegible> by which he shall have found his way into the State-a circumstance not at all affecting the fact whether he is a human being, endowed with all the faculties of a human being, and entitled to all the rights of a human being. If such a doctrine is not absurd and destitute of sense, and such as never would have entered into the head of anybody, but those who are wedded to the artificial principles of law, I do not know what would be such. 
I have often thought that the habit of studying the law has an effect in obscuring the mind from the perception of the clear principles of common sense and common justice, which are so readily felt and understood by people in other occupations. Lawyers often make artificial distinctions, where no one else would think of making them, and carry the subtleties of special pleading into the great and fundamental principles of justice. A man may make a good lawyer, and a miserable statesman. The one allows his reason to be shackled by the rigid and often arbitrary rules and principles of law, in all the views he takes of great national questions. The other takes a broad and expanded view of these questions, in reference to their influence upon the welfare of society, and the great principles of justice and humanity. No other circumstances will explain the illiberal and irrational views which pervade the speeches of many of our legislators in Congress, and the opinions of many of our distinguished lawyers and judges. There are views expressed, in many of these speeches and these opinions, which are totally abhorrent to all the first principles of justice, and even to the plain principles of common sense. These persons talk with great flippancy about the rights of individuals to hold property in human beings, and the political rights of States to determine their own institutions and laws, while they totally ignore, and treat with the utmost contempt, the doctrine that these human beings have any property in their own bodies and souls, and the same right to make use of their faculties for the acquisition of other kinds of property as they themselves have. They can prate about civil rights, which are the mere creatures of a political frame of government, but disregard, totally, 
those natural and inalienable rights which belong to the whole human family, whether black or white, which are the gift of God, and inherent in our very natures. W. S. A. 
ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTIONS IN NEW YORK. We call special attention to the series of Anti-Slavery Conventions to be held in Western and Central New York, commencing this day at Buffalo, and extending through the entire month of January-culminating in the anniversary of the State Convention, to be held in Albany, February 4th, 5th, and 6th. It will be seen that a strong array of speakers is advertised, among whom we are highly gratified to see the names of Gerrit Smith and Beriah Green. In all the various localities named, every effort should be made to secure a full attendance, by giving extensive notice of the meeting. 
It is by this process of �agitation" that the chains of the slave are to be broken, and the impending judgments of Heaven averted. Therefore, be up and 
doing! 
THE TRIBUNE AND WENDELL PHILLIPS. The editorial article we have copied on our first page from the Tribune, caricaturing Mr. Phillips for his noble devotion to the Anti-Slavery cause, has not a particle of truth or wit to redeem its coarseness and assurance. The Tribune has many anonymous contributors to its editorial columns, so that it is often a matter of guess-work as to the authorship of particular articles. In this instance, it is not difficult to identify the writer; and whatever intellectual smartness he may possess, his well-known habits are such as to render him as incompetent to measure the philanthropy, and moral elevation, courage and disinterestedness of Mr. Phillips, as a Hottentot is to judge of the merits of Shakespeare or Milton. In this he is out of his element. Let him learn to speak� the words of truth and soberness."
<c06>
THE DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION AND THE�SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY."
It were a �consummation devoutly to be wished" that the citizens of this country could be brought to understand the true character of our boasted Union. There are indications that Northern men, at least, will see, before the present agitation subsides, the utter and eternal incompatibility of freedom and slavery.
For the last quarter of a century, the changes have been rung so incessantly on the �inestimable value of the Union," the might of its power, the dread consequences of its rupture, that we at the North have not ventured to breathe a possibility of its disturbance, however slightly, even to ourselves. In direct violation of our finer instincts, we have been persuaded to press the viper of slavery to our bosoms, and suffer it to suck out our life-blood, as preferable to a dissolution of the Union.
It is only within a few short weeks that most of us have been made sensible of a marked modification of our proclivities in this respect. The possibility, may, the probability of a dissolution, will we or nill we, has been precipitated upon us by the South; and whatever may have been our previous misgivings, as to disunion, we have no choice but to look its responsibilities, if there be any, fully in the face. However cheerfully Northern men would have sacrificed for its maintenance in the past, under the impression of its incalculable benefits, the facts we find ourselves pondering in this season of anxiety force upon us all the question, whether the Union, under any such circumstances as we have been compelled to behold it, is, after all, so valuable a boon and worthy of so great sacrifice.
A few weeks more of opportunity to observe the Southern temper, as well as Southern weakness, in the elements of either intellectual or national strength, will not fail to convince most of us at the North that the presence of the South in the Union can well be dispensed with. It may be well for the South to understand, first and last, that the North, so far from dreading her threats of secession, has occasion to rejoice that she has taken the initiative, and proposes of her own accord to go out of the Union, and thus relieve us of the 
unpleasant necessity, at some future time, of forcibly removing from the body politic so hurtful an excrescence. 
The North and the South, or freedom and slavery are irreconcilable terms. Nothing like a Union in any rational sense has existed, or can exist, in the face of such facts as have been forced upon our contemplation for twenty-five years past. Whatever efforts may be made by the shuffling politician and statesman, unworthy the name, to force together what God and nature intended should be forever antagonistic, will be futile in all time to come. 
Union by force of law or by external pressure, as opposed to the laws of nature and reason, is inconsistent with the intelligence, the freedom, the wealth and power of the North. Whatever may have been the exigency existing when the thirteen States entered the Confederacy for Union against foreign and internal aggression, no such necessity now exits with the free States, which of themselves are a power sufficient to command the respect of every civilized country in the world. They are amply able to hold their place among the nations. They have the inherent skill to make the most of their great natural advantages, and could they once for all be entirely relieved of the incubus of slavery, a new impetus would be given to their energies, and the good effects would soon be visible in a rapid growth in wealth, intelligence and population.
It is time the South were made sensible of the impotency of her threats of dissolution; that she should open her eyes to the causes of her own ignorance, poverty and weakness; that she should be forced to understand, and if possible to be grateful for, the immense advantages she has enjoyed in times past by her 
connexion with the North; and that when bereft of the vitality and support which she draws from union with superior forces, she must soon sink to decay. Let Northern men but once become conscious of their strength and their immeasurably superior advantages, and they would have less occasion to tremble before the phantom of dissolution. The cry of Union is generated in pride, cowardice, and the consciousness of a bad cause. Whence comes the necessity for eternal preachment of the value of the Union, but that in the depths of our being we know the utter nonsense of attempting to force together elements which, in their essential nature, are eternally disjoined? 
Let the North duly appreciate its own strength, and the justness of its cause. In no spirit of defiance, but in the calmness of its own self-respect, let it afford to be generous; and if the South, either from taste or by force of its geographical position, desires to try the experiment of an independent existence, let it go with our good will. Let the separation, if it must come, be and cable; give them all the United States property now located within their present boundaries, pay all the existing national debt, and then make them a reasonable gratuity in ready cash to meet the smaller contingencies connected with setting up the new government. This would be a good outfit for a Southern Confederacy, and all connexion of the North with slavery forever ended. It would be the best bargain the North ever made, and perhaps the poorest for the South. 
Let the great truth be made to stand prominent before the civilized world, that the Northern section of this country alone embraces nearly all that is valuable in a material, moral and intellectual point of view; that it is to the vastly superior civilization of the North that the United States are entitled to respect abroad and at home; and if the character of a people, rather than the extent of its domain, furnishes a criterion by which to estimate its magnitude and power, then them sixteen Northern States, once made independent of slavery, are richer in all the elements of greatness than the present thirty-three burdened with the cost of supporting an institution which can operate only decay and final destruction wherever it goes.
Yes, gentlemen of the South, take your cotton and your beloved �institution," and lay the foundation of your Southern Confederacy; lash up up your slaves; draw on your own loins for their increase, swell by every means the product of your one great staple; go forward in your stupidity and ignorance in the labor of exhaustion of your soils; establish your military rule; tax yourselves most liberally, as you will be obliged, to do to maintain vast naval and army establishments; enlist the flower of your new-fledged nobility, as well as your �mud-sill" constituency, in the glorious task of preserving order within and without. With your thousands of miles of frontier, both on the land and the sea; with your vast plans for the conquest of Cuba and the dismemberment of the Mexican Empire, the robbery and pillage of the present territories of the United States, for the protection and maintenance of the high road from the Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of Mexico, the reopening of the African slave trade, for possible conflicts, not only with your immediate neighbor,-so recently your copartner,-but with the mighty powers on the opposite side of the Atlantic, to say nothing of the glorious opportunities you offer to one or more Anglo-African Garibaldis in your midst, and to John Browns on your borders and in the fastnesses of your mountains.
Go, we say, ye chivalric gentlemen, ye worshippers of yourselves, and of the �divine institution"! Go, and inaugurate your darling experiment of a Southern Confederacy, before which all Christendom must �pale her ineffectual fires." Give it a fair trial; and when you have suffered enough, and become wiser, knock at the doors of your abused brethren of the North, and we will not turn you away penniless. W.

JANUARY 4. THE LIBERATOR. 3
MEETING IN FITCHBURG.
Pursuant to appointment, the Worcester County North Anti-Slavery Society held its quarterly meeting on Saturday evening and Sunday, Dec. 8th and 9th in Fitchburg.
On Saturday evening, an informal meeting was held in the Trinitarian Church, which, from its faithful adherence to the cause of the American slave, has long been stigmatized as the 'Black Orthodox." The meeting was opened with prayer by the pastor, Elnathan Davis, and animated addresses were made by E. H. Heywood, of Boston, and H. Ford Douglass, of Chicago, upon the great problem of the day, and the principles involved in its solution. The speakers were listened to by not a large, but intelligent audience.
On Sunday, the meetings were held in the spacious Town Hall. The afternoon session was opened with reading of the Scriptures, and prayer by Joshua. T. Everett, of Princeton, President of the Society.
In the absence of the Secretary, F. H. Snow was appointed Secretary for the day.
For the consideration of the Convention, the following resolutions were presented by E. H. Heywood: 
1. Resolved, That though we rejoice in the recent triumph of the Republican party, at the ballot-box as the first Federal victory of "thirty years' war" for an idea; an insurrection of the awakening conscience of the North against an aggressive and insolent despotism; a revolt of the masses against the classes, and the elevation of the "mudsill" of our political fabric to the head of the corner, we by no means regard it as the end of the battle with slavery; but, while four million bondmen clank their chains upon our soil-while fifteen States are trodden into servility, ignorance and squalor by a fiendish and bloody oligarchy-while the man-hunter, under the aegis of law, courses with impunity throughout the insulted and disgraced empire of the North, and the unfettered ocean loathes multitudinous and still multiplying ships, crowded with the manacled freemen of Africa-our war-cry, as heretofore, must be not the restriction, but the extinction of this fivefold barbarism" and "sum of all  villanies": nor will any true Abolitionist lay off his armor while the foot of a single slave presses the continent.
2. Resolved, That since the national government in its present form, as in its origin and growth, is a conspiracy against the black man's rights, and a piratical bargain between the North and the South to doom him to perpetual slavery, the incoming administration of the Republican party must be pro-slavery; and Abraham Lincoln, with his indorsement of all the dishonest and fatal compromises ever claimed by Calhoun, or conceded by Webster-his declared fidelity to the Draconian black code of his own State his connivance with slavery in the District and the inter-State slave trade-and his startling attitude as the approved author and pledged executive of an "Efficient Fugitive Slave Law-like his predecessors, cannot but be, to the negro, a FEDERAL TYRANT-to be tolerated for a time, but, at length, repudiated and execrated by the kindling moral sense of the age, and thrown aside as a terror and warning to all future aggressors upon the rights of man.
3. Resolved, That whatever may be the opinion of the freemen of Massachusetts as to Federal obligations, it is due to our dignity and self-respect, as a sovereign State-to the historic glories of our Commonwealth-to the cause of impartial liberty everywhere-to the law of God spoken from Mount Sinai, and in the universal consciousness of the race-that soil, hallowed with the blood of heroes and the prayers of Puritans, shall no longer be desecrated by the polluting foot of the slave-hunter; and we solemnly demand of the Legislature elect, a law decreeing that all fugitives from the South, who choose to reside among us, shall be "free against the world."
4. Resolved, That the proposal of leading representatives of the Republican press to repeal the Personal Liberty Bills of the North, is a base betrayal, upon the threshold of office, of the very idea which lifted the party into power; a cowardly concession to the impudent and loud-mouthed ruffianism of the South, flagrant treason to freedom and humanity, and bold infidelity to the law of God, and should be scouted by every well-wisher of his country, or lover of his race.
5. Resolved, That the healthful and cheering agitation every where apparent in our politics has a sad and disheartening contrast in the deathly stupor of the American Church, still in the bonds of iniquity, and yet dead in tresspasses and sins; that its open and shameless fellowship of the apologists, defenders, and immediate supporters of slavery, with all their foul and appalling immoralities-its deliberate and atrocious sacrifice of four million immortal beings, with their countless descendants, upon the bloody Moloch of its own self aggrandizement-its idiotic denial of the sinfulness of slaveholding, after fifty years' examination under the meridian light of the 19th century-its adroit and unscrupulous efforts to shield it from the avenging bolts of the world's conscience-its haughty and tyrannic bearing toward the brave minority, championed by Cheever and Furness, unmasking its stupidity and crimes-and the tacit indorsement of the foreign slave trade in the recent refusal of the Episcopal Convention and the American Board to rebuke that ineffable abomination flourishing under the shadow of their own steeples, and in their own mission fields-make it the most powerful ally of oppression in this age, and a burning scandal to the Christian name.
6. Resolved, That the deliberate and avowed conspiracy to "crush out" free speech in Boston by mobocratic violence is a significant evidence of the demoralizing and barbarizing influence of National despotism-a humiliating spectacle of servility to Southern taskmasters, calling the roll of their white slaves under the shadow of Bunker Hill and Faneuil Hall-and a new and startling proof that the logical and inevitable result of the continuance of slavery on this continent must be the overthrow of all the guaranties of human rights which the toil and agony of centuries have erected, the obliteration of every vestige of constitutional freedom, the retrogression of civilization to the dark period of brute force; and hence, liberty of thought and lips, the security of persons and property, "law and order," alike with every sentiment of justice and humanity, demand the immediate removal of the primal source, the "causing cause" of the evils which lacerate and madden the nation SLAVERY IN THE STATES.
7. Resolved, That since the Federal Union is the Gibraltar of the slave system, not less than an impious and defiant insurrection against justice and God, which no freeman can support, except at the sacrifice of personal honor and the liberty of the negro, we hail with joy the mad and suicidal efforts of the South (however base and tyrannical her motives and purposes) to break it up, confident that its death-knell will be the hymn of emancipation to her enslaved millions; echoed by the acclamations of all free and generous hearts the world over.
Mr. Haywood then proceeded to expound the idea contained in the resolution concerning the Church. He proved conclusively, by sound reasoning and stubborn fact, that the American Church, with its forty thousand speechless pulpits, is utterly faithless to the rights of the down-trodden negro, and a shameless apostate to Christ.
The speaker then urged the importance of a more effective Personal Liberty Bill in the Old Bay State, and showed the hypocrisy of refusing to say in Boston, at the State House, as boldly as in the streets of Fitchburg, that no fugitive slave shall be returned to bondage from Massachusetts soil. No man in Fitchburg would help return a fugitive.
To the last remark, exception was taken by the President, who declared his belief that there were men in town so hopelessly the tools of the Slave Power, that they would gladly consent to become the bloodhounds of the South.
A brief discussion upon this point ensued between Messrs. Joel Smith, of Leominster, and Goodwin Wood, of Fitchburg.
In the evening, the Hall was nearly filled by an interested audience. The President offered to all present an opportunity to criticise and discuss the senti-
<c02>
ments advanced by the speakers. The resolutions of the afternoon having been read again, H. Ford Douglass presented the following resolution:-
8. Resolved, That we read with profound regret the declaration of the Hon. John P. Hale, of New Hampshire, in the Senate of the United States, that the South has the right to demand of the North the rendition of fugitive slaves, and that he is willing that there shall be an honest, fair and faithful performance of that duty; that such a concession on his part to the insolent demands of that combination of robbers and pirates called "Cotton States" is an outrage upon the confidence of the anti-slavery and liberty-loving North, who warmed him into political life, as well as another sad evidence of the demoralizing effect of American slavery upon every noble nature that places itself within the circle of its influence; demonstrating at once to every friend of freedom, that the duties and necessities of the hour demand that there shall be "NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS." 
Mr. Douglass was then listened to with fixed attention for nearly an hour and a half. He clearly showed the retrograde movement of John P. Hale, since 1852,  when he consented to be the representative of a platform, the chief plank in which was the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave Bill, while to-day he unblushingly declares himself ready to renew that hateful compromise with the slaveholding States. 
The speaker then paid an eloquent tribute to the memory of John Brown, remarking, that while he disclaimed the principle of force employed by the hero of Harper's Ferry, still, looking from the standpoint of his audience,, he would give more for the memory of John Brown fifty years hence, than for that of a hundred Washingtons; because Washington, having achieved liberty for himself, used it to fasten the chains upon the black man. 
Mr. Douglass then referred to the degraded position of the free colored man in this country, and pressed home to his audience the duty of securing to the negro his full rights. 
A collection was taken up, after which, Mr. Heywood made a brief speech, in which he revealed some striking inconsistencies in the Church, and in conclusion avowed himself in favor of a dissolution of the Union as a matter of justice, expediency and necessity. 
Throughout all the proceedings of the Convention, great interest was manifested by our people, and no disturbance whatever occurred, notwithstanding a few sympathizers of the Boston North Street' roughs, whose name with us is not legion, had declared their determination to break up the meetings; while one "grave and eminent" citizen, once the representative in our Legislature of a now defunct party, and a prominent member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, had illustrated the tone of his piety, and his fidelity to law and order, by publicly expressing the wish that, if the Abolitionists did hold a meeting, they would be served as they were in Boston! 
JOSHUA T. EVERETT, President.

A VOICE FROM VERMONT.
TOPSHAM, Vermont, Dec. 6th, 1860.
DEAR MR. GARRISON,-What are your Boston divines and Massachusetts editors made of? I had supposed that the Springfield Republican had some anti-slavery, at least some morality. Especially had I taken for granted that the Boston Recorder had some pretensions to regard for the Higher Law. But how can this be, when these papers unite-the religious following the secular!-in expressing such  infamous sentiments as lately appeared in their columns? Of course, you understand me to refer to the Republican's article, copied by the Recorder, and endorsed by its editor, recommending the repeal of such "Personal Liberty Laws," now existing in some of the Northern States, as are intended, or seem to be intended, to prevent the untrammelled operation of "lower law," whether Constitutional or Congressional. 
In these times, when such evidences of impiety and inhumanity are not uncommon, some of your readers, who may not have noticed the fact may be glad to learn  that the Vermont Legislature has recently refused to repeal her Personal Liberty  Law of two years' standing. The proposition to repeal came from a Democratic member of the House. Had it come from a leading member of the dominant party, it might have met with much more favor. As it was, however, the infamous proposition met with a decided negative. Let us rejoice that our "great little" State is both in advance of your Massachusetts Republicans and Recorders, and not yet ready to go on her knees to beg South Carolina to not go out of the Union. 
But I took up my pen to hastily inform the Liberator, that we have not forgotten the hero of Harper's Ferry and the martyr of Charlestown, as, according to a vote passed at our meeting when Messrs. Douglass and Remond gave us able and eloquent addresses, we have observed the anniversary of the execution of John Brown, by holding an anti-slavery meeting on the occasion. The meeting was not large, but quite spirited. Our presiding officer was an intelligent and zealous Garrisonian Abolitionist, whose young son bears the name of John Brown, in memory of the hero and martyr. Mr. Charles P. Divoll, a young man of talent-a Covenanter, and, of course, a Garrisonian also-delivered an eloquent eulogy on John Brown. The following resolutions were then introduced, which, after a spirited discussion by several speakers, were passed by a full and unanimous vote. They will give the animus of the meeting:-
Resolved, That the great object which we, as Abolitionists, have before us is the speedy and entire destruction of chattel slavery, and the temporal and spiritual salvation of the slave; and that the question before us to-night is not whether John Brown was a moral hero, and a noble martyr to a great principle-for to this, millions of warm hearts, if not as many eloquent voices, have given their verdict-but the great question before us, in common with all true-hearted philanthropists, is, how can we, with a conscience void of offence toward God and man, help to abolish slavery?
Resolved, That it is with pain we see strong indications of a retrograde movement in the ranks of political anti-slavery, and it is to be feared that, in accordance with the spirit of unholy compromise always dominant in the counsels of the nation, and to appease the threatening anger of the South, there may be successful efforts to compel Northern States to repeal their "Personal Liberty Laws." 
Resolved, That though very many anti-slavery men have recently done violence to their own principles, by voting for a presidential candidate who not only is opposed to the great truths long contended for by Abolitionists, but who is in favor of the North fulfilling her pro-slavery constitutional pledges to the South, as well as the infamous Congressional Fugitive Slave Law of 1850; yet we heartily rejoice that, in the election of Abraham Lincoln, we can see cheering indications of the rapid progress of the Idea of Freedom, in as much as he was elected principally by Northern votes, and by a Northern party in favor of excluding slavery from the national Territories. 
Whereas, the union between the slaveholding and non-slaveholding States was formed by base and unholy compromises with slavery, and still continues by the execution of said compromises; 
Whereas, the United States Government was formed in violation of the law of God, by allowing slaveholders to be eligible to office, and so to be able to control  the Federal Government; 
Whereas, the Federal Government, if true to the fundamental law of the land, must be a cruel despotism, aiding slave-masters to hold their human chattels;
Whereas, throughout the vast domains of slavery, liberty-loving men are fined, imprisoned, cruelly scourged and tortured, exiled, or shamefully put to death, for no crime but philanthropy; and 
Whereas, the South, by their inhuman laws, mock trials, and lawless violence,  have suppressed free speech and destroyed the freedom of the pulpit as well as of the press, while terror reigns throughout the do- 
<c03>
mains of slavery, thus fortifying itself by a wall more impassible to the friends of humanity than the Chinese; therefore, 
Resolved, That to cling to the Union, and to the United States Government as an institution worthy of the voluntary and conscientious support of the Christian, is worse than infatuation. 
Yours, for the slave, N. R. JOHNSTON. 

KANSAS. 
The Troubles in Southern Kansas-Kidnapping band broken up-Emancipated Slaves, &c.
ATCHISON, Kansas, Dec. 20,1860. 
WM. LLOYD GARRISON:
MY DEAR SIR,-I want to give you a statement of the troubles in Southern Kansas, and the present condition of affairs there. The wild statements telegraphed by the drunken, imbecile old man, Williams, who presides over the U. S. District Court in that vicinity, and the wilder rumors sent out by the "shivering chivalry" of Missouri, must have caused considerable confusion in the minds of Eastern readers. Let me tell you what I believe to be the real facts in the case. 
The cause of the hanging of the men executed by Dr. Jennison was this: they were notorious pro-slavery partisans, and were well known to have been both engaged in kidnapping colored men, and in aiding the assassination of white men. Owing to the forbearance of the anti-slavery men, the past summer, the gang to which these fellows belonged had become very active and daring. Two parties had been up to the Captain's (Montgomery) house, but had not the hardihood to attack it, and Dr. Jennison was fired at while returning to his home near Mound City. This for the offence against them. During the summer, members of the pro-slavery secret order are known to have hung or otherwise killed four of the Free-State men-Hugh Carlin, Guthrie, Frank Marshall, and John Denton. They claimed that these were horse thieves. Of this I know little, though I am not inclined to believe one iota of their pretext. 
But they have done this:-These men who were punished, and their companions, have kidnapped during the past summer, a number of free colored people. A number of refugees, families from Arkansas, driven from that pirate State by its inhuman laws, have settled in Bourbon and Linn counties, stimulated thereto by the sympathy expressed and the protection proffered by Capt. Montgomery and all of the active anti-slavery people. At Fort Scott, Barnesville, Trading Post and Paris, little towns in Kansas, either a few miles from or on the border, a number of the vilest ruffians have found shelter. These wretches are the dregs of the pro-slavery abomination of'56. When even these holes get too hot to hold them, they find shelter in Missouri, the citizens of which State readily give them aid and comfort. 
Out of these materials, a gang of active kidnappers has been formed, who indiscriminately seize, in Kansas, upon all persons whose skin  may  be darker than their own tobacco-stained cuticles, and whom their whiskey-soaked  consciences think it unsafe to allow at large, for honest people to make comparisons with themselves, or for whom they can nett a few hundreds. Missouri is a good market for kidnappers at this time. Slave-dealers find plenty of live stock, and they ask no questions if a likely chattel is offered at less than current rates. These ruffians make no pretence of carrying out the infamous fugitive slave law, though they pretend that the captured are fugitives. A number of persons have thus been kidnapped. 
Whatever may be said against force by the editor of the Liberator, and those who advocate non-resistance as a rule of conduct, this lesson has Kansas taught many, viz: "To do unto others as they would others should do unto them." I have often said before, the logic of force is very simple and direct, and men who have had to face death, and look down the revolver's mouth for a principle, are very apt to feel for others in the same position, even though it be the poor despised negro. From the mouth of a revolver to the cause which points it, is a very simple but direct process of reasoning, and from defending their own liberty and that of white men simply, they reason back logically to the system itself as the cause, and declare all must be free, ere peace can reign. 
Many men reach the same end by divers means, some later, some earlier. Let none complain who desire the right to triumph, even though it be through the Evangelists of Pluck, that the Gospel of Peace is proclaimed. "First pure, then peaceable," is a good sentiment for a fighting anti-slavery man. I am not going to argue the ethics of this view, for I am not inclined to split metaphysical hairs, when nothing can be found inside, or when hair-splitting of a more practical kind is to be done. I want to say, however, that this question would be solved much more readily for them if every colored man would resolve himself into a Pluck Evangelist, of either Gospel-that of Peace or of Resistance. 
But this is a digression. To return to the doings in Southern Kansas. Dr. Jennison, an active anti-slavery man living at Mound City, determined with his immediate command to put an end to kidnapping, and make an example of some of the gang. Russel Hines was the first man visited. The party consisted of seventeen or eighteen men. Capt. Montgomery was not in the party, and did not know of it till after the execution of Hines. This fellow was seized after having, by his own indiscretion, confessed the crime. He was held till morning, then tried by a jury of twelve men, found guilty of kidnapping, and hung. A card was left on his person, stating why he was hung, and declaring the determination of the people to serve all in the same way who should do the same act. Hines lived half a mile from the State line, and was in the habit of going over when in danger. 
The party then went south to the Osage, to the cabin of a man named Moore, a member of the same gang. The party that had shot at Jennison had been traced to his place, a few evenings before. He was summoned to surrender, the door was broken open, and while he was in the act of raising his gun, he was shot by Dr. Jennison, and instantly killed. His companion, a Vermonter named Scott, was taken prisoner, and tried next day, in the presence of two hundred persons; but sufficient evidence was not brought forward, and he was discharged. One or two others were arrested, but discharged. 
On the next night, the same party went to the house of a ruffian named Sam Scott, took him prisoner, convicted him of kidnapping, and hung him. This fellow was a notorious ruffian of'56, was at the sacking of Osawatomie, and was known to have committed violence upon two Free State women at that time. Through all this, which created no unusual excitement in Kansas, for it was well known that none but the guilty should be punished, Capt. Montgomery had not left his farm, Fort Scott had not been seized or even approached, Judge Williams was not threatened, nor was Missouri invaded. 
Let me here remark, that Capt. Montgomery, with his command, has never invaded the State of Missouri. The only act of the kind was the liberation of eleven slaves, in the winter of'58, by Captains John  Brown and Aaron Stevens, of immortal memory. The first the people of Linn County knew that they had taken any towns, broken up the United States Courts and Land Office, frightened the Judge, and invaded the State, was when the papers returned with the despatches forwarded by the scared Judge. 
The only time Montgomery left his farm was when a pro-slavery neighbor, McDonald, was arrested and tried by the Squatter Court, on the charge of piloting a party to the Captain's house. Being so near, he was compelled to attend. The Secretary of the Territory, Beebe, was present, and at his request the man was dismissed. The Secretary talked with Jennison and his party, listened to their reasons, and coincided with them fully. He then came to Lecompton, and published a proclamation against them, and otherwise added fuel to the flame. 
<c04>
After this, Jennison's party left the field, and has not since appeared. This was the whole of the difficulty-three men killed for kidnapping, after being tried and proved guilty. The courts are in the hands of officials who sympathize with the kidnappers, and pack juries against the Free State men. 
The real cause of the bluster was to add fuel to the disunion movement. Harney was sent to precipitate a border war.  He is a disunionist, and hoped to involve Missouri and Arkansas, with the slaveholding Indians, in that movement. No doubt, the same strings acted upon that drunken puppet, Governor Stewart of Missouri. 
Harney was sent with general instructions to hunt, burn and destroy. These were afterwards modified so as to make them subservient to the civil authorities of the Territory. He was exceedingly angry at this, and while Gov. Medary was at Fort Scott with the command, every effort was made to induce him to proclaim the two counties of Linn and Bourbon in a state of insurrection, but without avail.  A public meeting was held at Fort Scott, and resolutions passed to the effect that martial law should be declared. But Medary knew better, and would not yield. Harney, in addition to his general blood-thirsty character, was willing for any pretext by which to cover up the laughable position wherein the cowardice of Williams and the over-anxiety of the ultraists had placed him. Gen. Frost, of the Missouri militia, was anxious to cross the border, but Medary was inflexible, so the storm blew over. 
On the day of the land sales, the troops were drawn up in front of the office, and two pieces of cannon placed to command the settlers. No disturbance occurred, though the insolent conduct of the U. S. Marshal and his deputies was well calculated to provoke one. Seven men were arrested and thrown into a jail, heavily ironed. They asked for the warrants to be shown them, but none were shown. The next day, they demanded an examination, and were taken before a Justice of the Peace at the County seat. No one could be obtained on the part of the Government to act as prosecuting witness; so, after keeping them two days, the men were discharged. All of the seven could have proved an alibi; but the fears of the kidnappers were a sufficient protection. 
After making a laughable parade, by surrounding, with great display of warlike pomp, Captains Jennison's and Montgomery's dwellings, to find no one in them except the wives and children, the troops returned with General Harney to Fort Scott. A company of dragoons and two of infantry were left at Fort Scott and Mound City, but as the majority of these are either Germans or old "Jim Lane men" of'56, who enlisted during the hard winter that followed, it is not anticipated they will engage either in murder or robbery, as has been the case hitherto with United States troops located in that section. Jennison and Montgomery have probably returned ere this, and things will resume their wonted course. 
The gang of kidnappers who so long have been a terror to the colored people of Kansas are nearly all killed or in prison. Two of them are in jail at Lawrence, charged with robbery and kidnapping, two in Leavenworth, three were killed in Linn and Bourbon counties, and two more (one of them a quadroon named Allen Pinks) are waiting trial at Kansas City, Mo. These last stole a man in Kansas, sold him in Missouri, then attempted to steal another in the State, with the intention of selling him in another town. They were caught in the act, and in all probability will be sent to the penitentiary. Two more are reported as having been killed near Osawatomie during the past fall. The only one now at liberty is the notorious Jack Hurd, who broke jail at Council Bluffs, Iowa, a few weeks since. It is possible that a colored man may live peaceably in Kansas hereafter. 
The U. G. R. is in successful operation. I heard of the safe arrival of a train bound for the North Star a few days since. In Leavenworth, there are two companies of emancipated slaves from Kentucky and Alabama. They have a large amount of money in the hands of agents-some $60,000 in all-and I am told that it is doubtful if they will get any of this amount. My blood boils when I hear of these outrages, and sometimes I feel ashamed of my color, so mean and cowardly do the boasted superior race act to the poor and oppressed. A large colony is being organized in Leavenworth for the purpose of emigrating to Hayti in the spring. It will consist of a number of colored families from Arkansas, a number of emancipated slaves already spoken of, and others in the vicinity. It will number from 75 to 100 persons, and leave about May. 
I intended to tell you of a movement projected in Kansas, in the event of a secession of the cotton States, but as this letter is already too long, I forbear. 
Hoping that Boston will soon retrieve itself from the odium lately cast upon its good name, I may also trust that the next Beacon street ruffian who heads a mob to prevent free speech will be made an example of, by some one who does not believe in non-resistance. 
In this hope, I remain, 
Yours, RICHARD J. HINTON. 

A VOICE FROM HARPER'S FERRY. A Narrative of Events at Harper's Ferry; with Incidents prior and subsequent to its Capture by Capt. Brown and his Men. By Osborne P. Anderson, ONE OF THE NUMBER. 1861. 
It is a fortunate circumstance indeed, that, of all Capt. Brown's associates, "the only man alive who was at Harper's Ferry during the entire time," is enabled to record the facts for history, as they actually transpired, in regard to that famous effort to liberate the slaves of Virginia, and ultimately all who are pining in the Southern house of bondage. Much has been given as true," says Mr. Anderson, referring to the press generally, "that never happened; much has been omitted that should have been made known; many things have been left unsaid, because, up to within a short time, but two could say them-one of whom has been offered up, a sacrifice to the Moloch, Slavery." The other, being Mr. Anderson himself, he has undertaken to discharge that duty; and he has done it in a very modest and creditable manner. The Narrative is published for his benefit, and no doubt will find ready purchasers: it is wholly his own composition. Though belonging to a race, "peeled, meted out, and trodden under foot," on account of their complexion, Mr. Anderson proves that he is "every inch a man." 
OFFICIAL HYPOCRISY. To-day is the National Fast, proclaimed by President Buchanan with matchless dissimulation, and in the vain hope of" circumventing God," and" covering a multitude of sins." Himself guilty of the blackest treason, by his glaring complicity with the traitors of South Carolina, and largely responsible for much of the evil that has come upon the nation, he touches the bottom of cant and impiety by this affectation of reverence and humiliation of spirit. For the fast which is acceptable to God, but most "fanatical" to the President and the South, see Isaiah 1st, 58th and 59th chapters. 
PROGRESS OF THE TREASON. The latest intelligence from South Carolina is, that she is determined to fight the General Government, and is therefore erecting batteries by the aid of her slaves, (!) and obstructing the channels to Fort Sumter. She threatens to sink the Government steamer, Harriet Lane, if she attempts to enter the harbor of Charleston; and will attempt to starve out and capture the small body of U. S. troops at Fort Sumter. Major Anderson has telegraphed that he does not ask for any reinforcement, but is ready to "laugh a siege to scorn." 
Senator Wade has been threatened with assassination at Washington, by a Mississippian, for his speech against the treasonable course of South Carolina. 
TO CORRESPONDENTS. We are obliged to R. B. for her translation of one of Hans Andersen's stories, (we will print it next week,) and it will give us pleasure to receive other favors of a similar kind. 
A letter from Marius R. Robinson is in type. One from Parker Pillsbury is just received, but too late for insertion this week. 
<c05>
BORDER WAR BETWEEN THE CAROLINAS. In the Charlotte (N. C.) Bulletin appears a singular town ordinance. It provides that the engineers, conductors, firemen, train hands, and all employees of the Charlotte and South Carolina Railroad, and the messengers and employees of Adams's Express Company, running on said road, be restricted to the grounds of the Charlotte and South Carolina Railroad Depot; and all persons residing in Charlotte, white and black, are forbidden visiting said depot grounds under the penalties provided in the ordinance. In pursuance of this ordinance, Mr. Little, the Mail Agent from Columbia, S. C., was not permitted to leave the grounds of the railroad. He refused to deliver the mails unless permitted to go to the post office, and up to Saturday evening, 22d inst, the citizens of Charlotte and adjacent towns were cut off from all mail communication with South Carolina. This looks as though the North Carolinians are as much afraid of South Carolina as of Northern incendiaries, or else they mean to give their hot-spur neighbors a taste of the advantages of isolation.
BEHOLD THE DIFFERENCE! The following figures will show how much the disaffected Southern States contribute towards the support of its departments. They are the annual Post Office receipts and expenditures of the five States from the latest reports-Southern figures: South Carolina receipts, $107,536; expenditures,  $319,068; deficit, $211,523. Georgia receipts, $168,965; expenditures, $358,180;  deficit, $189,515. Florida receipts, $25,932; expenditures, $171,185; deficit, $145,253. Alabama receipts, $129,103; expenditures, $363,620; deficit, $234,526.  Mississippi receipts, $101,549; expenditures, $307,001; deficit, $286,445.  Total receipts in the five States, $532,784; expenditures, $1,581,068; deficit, $1,049,281. 
MODEST PROPOSITION. Northern men who imagine that the repeal of Personal Liberty Laws and a little miscellaneous dirt-eating will turn back the secession tide, are invited to digest the following from the Charleston Mercury, in which the demands of the propagandists are stated:-
"And what guarantees should satisfy the South? In my estimation, nothing short of amendments to the Constitution that would make negro Slavery legal and perpetual in every State of the Union, and upon every foot of territory that now belongs, or ever shall belong, to the United States. It is not only possible, but probable, that such a reaction may take place in the public mind."
This, from a correspondent, is endorsed by the Mercury as sound doctrine.
LINCOLN'S INAUGURATION. The Washington correspondent of the Boston Atlas and Bee says:-
"One of the favorite bugaboos hereabouts is the story that Lincoln's inauguration is to be prevented by force, and men will take you mysteriously aside, and tell you that there are so many hundred men drilling here, and so many there, who design to seize the Capitol, and prevent Lincoln from taking the oath. They do not know, perhaps, that for every hundred desperadoes that they might raise for such a violent demonstration, a thousand men would be here to see the laws enforced and rebellion suppressed. Frequent threats are made against the lives of Lincoln and Hamlin. Mr. Hamlin received, three days since, an anonymous letter, warning him to go home to Maine, if he regarded his personal safety; and both Lincoln and Mrs. Lincoln have received letters of a similar tenor. Of course, no attention is paid to such dastardly insinuations or threats. It would not surprise me, however, if we had some violent demonstrations here; they are likely incidents of such disturbed and troublous times. All I desire is, that every patriot should be in his place, and stand firmly by the right."
STARTLING DECISION. The Court of Queen's Bench in Canada decided in favor of the surrender of the fugitive slave Anderson, claimed under the Ashburton treaty as a fugitive from justice from Missouri. The decision is startling, as it probably imperils the safety of every fugitive in Canada. Intense excitement followed the decision, and a rescue was feared. But Canadian sympathy is aroused. A large meeting was held on the 20th ult., at Toronto, at which strong speeches were made against his rendition by lawyers, clergymen, and others. A resolution was passed to appeal the case to England, if necessary, and a petition was addressed to the Administrator of the Government praying for the release of Anderson. 
REPUDIATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S PROCLAMATION FOR A FAST. The Baptist Society connected with the Baptist Church at South Reading, held a meeting between services on Sunday, at which they voted not to observe the Fast recommended by the President, on Friday next.
The Dial, (Cincinnati: Rev. M. D. Conway, editor,) after an existence of one year, has ceased, on account of the inability of the editor to bear the labor it adds to his usual and necessary duties.

WEDNESDAY, the 23d of January, Day and Evening, in Music Hall, Boston. 
As accidental omissions are almost unavoidable, even of those whose company is most desired, the Ladies hasten to say that ALL who hate slavery, and wish to become subscribers to the funds for its peaceful, immediate abolition, without expatriation, may obtain special invitations (without which no party is ever admitted) at the Anti-Slavery Office, 221 Washington Street, and of the Ladies at their respective homes.

The friends of the Cause in distant cities, or in country try towns, with whom we have been so long in correspondence, are earnestly entreated, for the sake of the Cause, at this moment of hope and cheer, when the very evidences of progress make it difficult to raise money in large sums,-to take up collections in their respective neighborhoods; using all diligence to make the amount of smaller subscriptions supply any deficiency the hard times may possibly occasion in the larger ones. Now, as the very time for the most efficient expenditure, should be the time of most devoted effort. It is to be hoped that not a town in any State where we have ever had correspondence, nor an individual whose heart is in unison with ours on this subject, will be found wanting to our list. We have ample opportunity to know that there are many such at the South, as well as at the North, for we are not exclusively of Northern birth, nor all free from the painful remembrance of having once been slaveholders. We hope to welcome as many as possible at the evening reception;-at all events, to receive their subscriptions by letter. Some of the ladies will be ready, while directing the arrangements for the evening reception, to welcome and receive the subscriptions of all their friends who prefer to make their calls during the day.
The Germania Band will fill the pauses of conversation in the evening. The guests may leave cloaks and shawls in the care of the attendants at the entrance and in the ante-rooms.
Each invitation must be countersigned by the guest, as last year, before presenting at the door. 
If Mr. Henry Alexander will call on R. F. Wallent, at 221 Washington street, he will find the document which he left at 26 Essex street.

THE OLD YEAR AND THE NEW.
The sun looks over the eastern hills,
But his glance is chilling and cold; 
He is weaving a robe for the gay New Year
From the fading threads of the Old-
Of emerald, azure, and gold,
From the fading threads of the Old!
The winds, with many a midnight chant, have reaped their flowers and leaves,
And blithely in the morning hours have bound their rustling sheaves.
The snow-bird hops in the brown old hedge,
And his chirp is merry and gay;
He is calling his from her wintry nest,
On the rocking and snow- spray-
Little heed of the cold have they,
On the rocking and snow-wreathed spray!
Their brown coats, smoothed upon their breasts, protect and keep them warm,
And safe as swallows in sun, they 'bide the storm.
The boy looks forth, 'neath his golden curls,
For the gay and merry New Year;
He is wishing the days were soon flown away,
He is hoping for pleasure and cheer-
And joys ever promising near,
In the days that bring pleasure and cheer!
He sees the fresh spring grasses wave beneath the deepening snows,
And hears the summer's softest breath in every blast that blows.
The old man stands, with his frosty locks,
On the verge of the gay New Year;
It is taking him back to the olden time,
As he silently drops a tear!
O'er the Old Year's snowy-wreathed bier,
As he silently drops a tear!
Old friends come back; and olden days, and olden memories dim,
That long were locked in by-gone times, come thronging back to him.
To all there cometh a new, new year,
When the days of the olden are o'er;
And it cometh to some on the verge of this,
And to some on the farther shore!
When the days of the old are o'er,
And to some on the farther shore!
When Time, with his unfailing scythe, hath reaped the flowers and leaves,
The heart has left its harvest-field, to bind its golden sheaves.
The sun looks over the eastern hills,
But his glance is chilling and cold;
He is weaving a robe for the gay New Year
From the fading threads of the Old!
Of emerald, azure, and gold,
From the fading threads of the Old!
And thus do we, as days go by, that come to us no more,
Our robes prepare when we shall stand upon the farther shore.

THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.
The star-spangled banner that blows broad and brave,
O'er the home of the free, o'er the hut of the slave-
Whose stars in the face of no foe e'er waxed pale, 
And whose stripes are for those that the stars dare assail-
Whose folds every year broad and broader have grown, 
Till they shadow both arctic and tropical zone,
From the Sierra Nevada to Florida's shores,
And, like "Oliver Twist," are still asking for more-
That banner whose infantine bunting can boast
To have witnessed the Union's great charter engrossed;
Which at Boston saw Freedom's stout struggle begun,
And from Washington welcomed its victory won-
For our fathers in rebel defiance it spread,
But to us it waves brotherly greeting instead; 
And Concord and peace, not Bellona and Mars,
Now support England's Jack and the States' Stripes and Stars.
Can it be there are parricide hands that would tear
This star-spangled banner, so broad and so fair? 
And if there be hands would such sacrilege try, 
Is the bunting too weak the attempt to defy?
Alas! while its woof Freedom wove in her loom,
She paused in her work, and the Fiend took her room,
And seizing the shuttle that Freedom had left,
Threw Slavery's warp across Liberty's weft.
How the Fiend laughed and leaped as the swift shuttle flew,
With its blood-rotted threads, the fair weft running through!
"Now cut out your web-it is broad, it is long"-
Twixt Fiend's work and Freedom's, let's hope it is strong!'
And now that the blood-rotted warp is worn bare,
The flag it is fraying, the flag it may tear;
For the Fiend cheers on those who to rend it essay,
And the work he's had hand in is apt to give way.
Now, Heaven guide the issue! May Freedom's white hands,
Ere too late, from the flag pluck these blood-rotted strands; 
And to battle and breeze fling the banner in proof
That 'tis all her own fabric, in as in woof.
If this may not be, if the moment be nigh
When this banner, unrent, shall no more flout the sky,
To make fitting division of beams and of bars,
Let the South have the Stripes, and the North have the Stars.
-Punch.

A GLORIOUS REMNANT YET.
BY JOHN G. WHITTIER.
Ay, there's a glorious remnant yet,
Whose lips are wet at Freedom's fountains,
The coming of whose welcome feet
Is beautiful upon our mountains!
Men, who the gospel tidings bring
Of Liberty and Love forever,
Whose joy is one abiding spring,
Whose peace is as a gentle river!
But ye, who scorn the thrilling tale
Of Carolina's high-souled,
Which echoes here the mournful wail
Of sorrow from Edisto's waters,
Close while ye may the public ear-
With malice vex, with slander wound them-
The pure and good shall throng to hear,
And tried and manly hearts surround them.
Oh, ever may the power which led
Their way to such a fiery trial,
And strengthened womanhood to tread
The wine-press of such self-denial,
Be round them in an evil land,
With wisdom and with strength from Heaven,
With Miriam's voice, and Judith's hand,
And Deborah's song for triumph given!
And what are ye who strive with God,
Against the ark of his salvation,
Moved by the breath of prayer abroad,
With blessings for a dying nation?
What, but the stubble and the hay
To perish, even as flax consuming,
With all that bars His glorious way,
Before the brightness of His coming?
And thou, sad Angel, who so long
Hast waited for the glorious token,
That Earth from all her bonds of wrong
To liberty and light has broken-
Angel of Freedom! soon to thee
The sounding trumpet shall be given,
And over Earth's full jubilee
Shall deeper joy be felt in Heaven!
SONNET.
The might of one fair face sublimes my love,
For it hath weaned my heart from low desires;
Nor death I heed, nor purgatorial fires.
Thy beauty, antepast of joys above,
Instructs me in the bliss that saints approve;
For, O! how good, how beautiful, must be
The God that made so good a thing as thee,
So fair an image of the heavenly Dove!
Forgive me if I cannot turn away
From those sweet eyes that are my earthly heaven,
For they are guiding stars, benignly given,
To tempt my footsteps to the upward way;
And if I dwell too fondly in thy sight,
I live and love in God's peculiar light.

THE SUFFERING IN KANSAS.
ATCHISON, Kansas, Dec. 20, 1860.
WM. LLOYD GARRISON:
MY DEAR SIR,-Sitting here in a comfortable room, thinking of friends in the city afar, with the mercury considerably below freezing point without, and the white snow drifting silently down over the bare brown bluffs and roads, I concluded that it would be pleasant to me, and not objectionable to you or your readers, if should pen a few notes about affairs of Kansas and its present condition.
I have been here two weeks to-day, but hope to be eastward-bound on Monday next. During the visit, I have seen much that was sad, and little that was encouraging, in the condition of the inhabitants of this Territory. Atchison being the only railroad point in Kansas is, therefore, the head-quarters of the Relief Committee. I stopped in this town three days before going to the interior, watching the operations of the relief office, and conversing with scores of men from different sections relative to the distress prevailing among them. Words cannot paint in their fearful reality the terribly vivid pictures of distress and suffering their simple words described. Men, many of whom I have known,-stalwart, sober, industrious, live men,-come here from one to two hundred miles, with ox teams, leaving wives and children on from six to twelve days' allowance of food, portioned out in rations much less in quantity than those doled out to plantation negroes. They come for their settlements, to obtain such relief as the Committee can give. In many cases, there is nothing on hand, or the mill which is running steadily cannot grind the corn to meal fast enough to keep them supplied. I wish you could have seen, as I did, when landing here, the long line of wagons on the levee, with hungry-looking oxen, and their still hungrier-looking owners, standing shivering in the biting wind, their garments, in many instances, fluttering to its breath, so ragged and woebegone that one's heart grew tender, and eyes filled with sad tears. Fifty wagons were in that day, two-thirds of which had come from the far southwestern settlements, and on the next, and on the third, twenty-five to forty arrived; and so it has been continually. To-day, there are not so many in town, but it is only a temporary lull. Such stories as these men tell! One or two instances of actual starvation are reported, but as they are not so well authenticated, I refrain from giving them. Let me give you the outlines of one statement.
The man's name is Spillman. He lives on one of the branches of the Verdigris river, in the extreme southwest, one hundred and seventy miles from here. He is well known, and considered reliable. Nothing was raised in his neighborhood. The people are mostly new settlers. They have sold their cattle, &c., to live upon. Previous to Mr. Spillman's leaving for this point, all of the provisions in the community, which consists of two hundred persons, was divided into rations, which it was then estimated would last ten or twelve days (I am not certain which). The teams had been eight days in reaching Atchison, and could not possibly get back before the rations were exhausted, and the people several days without food, except such nuts and roots as the woods afford.
This is not a solitary instance. Whole communities in these remote counties camp together, putting their provisions into a common stock, and send up a wagon or two to get supplies. A rain storm may cause the streams to rise, so as to make them impassable for days together; and in any case, these long journeys over tracks barren of grass, with animals weakened by scanty fodder, and men scantily clothed and poorly supplied with food, is one of the worst features of this destitution. Yet it cannot be helped. It is impossible to forward the stuff to them, because it would cost so much to pay freight as to swallow up much more than is likely to come in. Again, the system adopted seems admirably well calculated to prevent fraud, and relieve those in need. Each township or county appoints a committee. When supplies are sent for, one or more men are selected to go, generally with regard to the fact that they either have a better team, or are in possession of more decent rays by way of clothing. When I say rags, I mean literally that. I have not seen a half dozen men whose shreds of garments could be called by any other name. But to return. These men are furnished with an order on the General Agent here, signed by all the members of the Committee. On arrival at Atchison, the order is presented, and entered on a book kept for that purpose. As soon as possible, the distance the applicant comes being taken into consideration, he is furnished with such a quantity as the supplies on hand will allow. The general amount hitherto has not been for each township more than ten sacks of corn meal, and the same of potatoes. Now the supplies come in more rapidly, and are consumed with equal speed. Some communities are receiving special consignments sent by their local agents. After the supplies are given, the settlers sign a printed receipt for the amount, which is kept in a book for that purpose. With a freight account and cash books to refer to, as well as a published statement weekly of supplies given and received, it would seem as if fraud could not be possible. I have made diligent inquiry as to the workings of this system, and find it meets the general approbation. Of course, there will be some cases overlooked, and some grumblers: but the result is very different from the operations of the Central Committee of Kansas in the winter of '56-'7.
I do not know what New England is doing to relieve those who are crying for aid from this Territory. I am informed that, with the exception of a few small individual donations, and a contribution from a church in Connecticut, nothing has yet been received from the Eastern States. What is the reason? I know that contributions have been made, and have heard that some Committee which received them intend sending an agent to distribute the same. Why don't they do it now? The people are in want, and so far as my observation extends, they have improvised good working machinery, which will be a more effectual barrier against imposition than can be the individual sympathies of any good-hearted, well-meaning man who may be sent to distribute your fund, who will, from his ignorance of the special necessities of each locality, be liable to be imposed upon by any tale that may touch his sensibilities. It seems as if the common Western complaint, that Eastern men have no faith in any body else's good sense or reliability except themselves, was true indeed. But I have faith in New England, and only hope that they will remember in earnest these words of Holy Writ-" For the poor ye always with you."
There is one practical method by which a very pressing need here may be supplied. If our Eastern friends could see the ragged garments of those who come in for supplies, they would not long suffer it to be so. I have heard of women wearing moccasins made of gunny bags, and have seen numbers of men with the most miserable apologies for shoes, &c. Bear in mind that those who come here are invariably the best clothed of their respective communities. They tell of whole households barefooted, and well authenticated cases of complete nakedness have been narrated. Men's, women's and children's boots and shoes, of all sizes, are very much needed. Stuffs for under garments and women's clothing are also needed. They can be made here. Any stout, serviceable article of wearing apparel will be of service. The United States and American Express Companies will bring such goods to this point free of charge.
If the friends could stand but one half day in the relief office here, and see and hear for themselves, I feel sure the apparent apathy of the Eastern States would not continue. There are forty thousand persons in Kansas who win need support of some kind during the present winter. I have but few words to say to the readers of the Liberator on this subject. The men and women now suffering in Kansas, by their heroic devotion, their undaunted courage,
<c03>
their unflinching steadfastness, have saved a region from the grasp of Slave Power as large as that occupied by the original Confederation. They have given an Anti-Slavery State to the West, to be a " leaven which shall leaven the whole lump," made possible the sublime sacrifice of that Virginian gallows, educated those seventeen young heroic souls who flung themselves at Harper's Ferry against the curse of slavery, in a daring hope for freedom, and lifted the whole nation higher by their Christ-like spirit of self-sacrifice, have given birth and expression to such men as James Montgomery, Dr. Jennison and Preacher Stewart, who declare that all men shall be protected from the fangs of the bloodhound and the malignity and avarice of the man-hunter. This community is in danger of being broken up, these people are likely to perish of hunger, fever, and the ills which grow out of such a terrible insufficiency of food. Will the anti-slavery people of New England and the North allow this? They will have to be up and doing, aiding those who cry aloud, or much suffering will ensue. Yours,
RICHARD J. HINTON.
EXTRACT OF A LETTER.
NORTH SCITUATE, Dec. 3, 1860.
DEAR FRIEND GARRISON:
It is mortifying to see even Unitarian clergymen more excited about consequences than causes. If the Boston pulpits had labored the last twenty years to create an anti-slavery spirit, the present hue and cry about the awful state of the Union would have been prevented. But no, they keep quiet, and conservative, and prudent, till the sore breaks, and then they are frightened, and preach discourses of fear and terror. They have seen the slow match ignited and burning steadily and surely for years, without saying a word about putting it out, and now the explosion is near at hand, they preach "timely and impressive discourses." So be it. Every man in his place; some for solemn funerals, and some for preventing sickness. One cannot help, however, admiring superior wisdom, and the foolish may learn by experience.
Our fathers, in framing the Constitution, swerved from the right, when they demanded the free States to take part in enslaving our fellow-creatures, by delivering the fleeing bondman to his pursuer; and no permanent peace nor prosperity can bless our native land till she changes her contract on this subject. Better, far better, that the North and South should be separate confederacies than we continue to perpetuate this wrong; and best of all, that the States be preserved in Union by a National Convention to amend the Constitution, by striking out the unrighteous provision to deliver up the fleeing slave. We are in of the Union, not only of our States, but of all the nations of the world; but not of a contract to perpetuate the horrid sin of slavery; and God will see to it that, sooner or later, a Personal Liberty Bill shall be enacted and observed in every State of the Union. Massachusetts may or may not stand firm in the coming and the future conflicts between freedom and slavery, righteousness and unrighteousness; but there are individuals who will remain steadfast, till what our Governor says of the State shall hold good and true for the whole country. W. G. B.
FROM HAYTI.
[Translated by Dr. J. S. Rock, for the Liberator.] 
On the 13th inst., at half-past 7 o'clock, P. M., Capt. Church, of the American brig 'Uranus,' and several men belonging to that vessel, discharged their revolvers at the chief officer of this port, and the men in his service. Unhappily, one man was severely wounded in the arm and in his breast.
The strangers who have committed this criminal act will learn that such an attack on the persons of the police (who had used no violence against the aggressors) can never be justified. Strangers must submit to the summons of the police-the regulations being the same for strangers as for natives. According to established custom, the stranger who arrives in a country accepts the laws which regulate that country, and more especially so do the captains from foreign countries, who, on entering their ships at the customhouse, sign their declaration of arrival, and swear at the same time to submit to the regulations of the port. Another thing which must not be lost sight of is, that foreign vessels which come here to trade, do so at least on the faith of a treaty, or on that of the liberty of commerce. Now, the captains find themselves, in the one case or the other, immediately under our protection. How then is it, that those men come here to obtrude upon us so odiously in defiance of the laws? Here the law is the same for all. We are convinced that Captain Church and his sailors, who have committed this intolerable act, will find pardon neither from the laws of this country nor those of the United States, nor her representatives here; for if the latter do not lend their influence and aid to the Haytien Government to put down such acts of violence, American commerce will soon be in peril in our ports.
The Consular Agent of the United States (Mr. Loring) has nobly promised justice for the conduct of these American citizens. As to the Haytien authorities, who are now investigating this case, we know that they will be just, and do their duty. The Commandant of the Arrondissment has already used great moderation, which was necessary to calm the excitement of the masses, who were furiously aroused, and demanded immediate justice. The town was, during the whole night, on the 'qui vive'-and why? To look after the natives, who would have organized themselves, and taken vengeance on board the "Uranus." Certainly, in the opinion of some of our fellow-citizens, such a barbarous act, in the middle of the nineteents century, on the part of men who pretend to be civilized, merits from us a response equally savage. But no-the good sense and moderation of the authorities and our citizens have checked the ardor of the masses; and it is honorable for us to be able to say that the offenders are respected, notwithstanding their crime, because we know that they are under our laws, which they have violated.
Notwithstanding our civilizing aspirations, this act will injure our commercial relations with the United States, if ever it is attempted to be repeated.
For the Liberator.
SONG FOR THE FOURTH OF JANUARY.
BY THE OLD COLONY BARD.
TUNE-The Poachers.
I.
Come, one and all, throughout the land, aside your labors cast,
The "glorious" Union now to save, let's hold a general fast;
From North to South, from East to West, pour forth a rending wail,
And with a copious flood of tears allay the rising gale-And with a copious flood of tears allay the rising gale.
II.
The "glorious" Union trembles now; alas! and woe the day,
That Dissolution e'er should think to cross the UNION'S way!
The precedent is dangerous, we must in sadness own;
Then on this fourth of January let us fast and groan!
Then on this fourth of January let us fast and groan!
III.
Slaveholders, groan, lest ye may lose all hope of Northern aid;
Groan, ye fire-eaters, ere ye reap the whirlwind ye have made!
Buchanan, groan, between two fires, groan as you feel the flames-
O, how impossible to play, at once, two different games!
O, how impossible to play, at once, two different games!
IV.
Groan, ye who once did worship Clay, and Webster, and Calhoun-
Groan, lest the which they adored should set in blood at noon!
A brilliant galaxy might shine, perhaps, upon their graves,
Did all men banish from their thoughts millions of chattel slaves!
<c04>
Did all men banish from their thoughts millions of chattel slaves!
V.
Then let us all together join to celebrate this fast-
As great events come far between, this chance may be our last;
Let's weep and howl, and rend our hair, and go without our food,
Believing such a solemn fast must surely do some good-
Believing such a solemn fast must surely do some good!
A FAST APPOINTED.
The telegraph says that President Buchanan has appointed January 4th as a day of fasting and prayer for the Nation. It is well. If ever a nation had cause to fast and pray, we have. Thomas Jefferson, in his day, in commenting upon slavery, said he trembled for his country, when he remembered that God was just; and we have not improved any since Jefferson's time. Let us fast, therefore, by all means. Let us fast, because when we had fought the war of the Revolution, we ever suffered slavery to exist at all in our country. Let us fast, because for eighty years this guilty nation has held millions of God's poor in bondage. Let us fast, because we have robbed the poor of their wages. Let us fast, because of the husbands and wives we separated, and the families we have broken up. Let us fast, because we have shut the pages of light and knowledge from the eyes of a whole race in our midst. Let us fast, for the Bible that we have chained, so that the slave's eye shall not look upon its blessed truths. Let us fast, for our wicked priests and churches which teach that slavery is right. Let us fast, for our Tract Societies, our Missionary Societies, our Presbyteries and General Assemblies, our Associations and Religious Conventions, our New York Observers and our New York Heralds, our "South-side" Adamses and our President Lords, and all other sorts and conditions of moral cowards, individual and collective. Let us fast, for our Fugitive Slave Law and its innocent victims. Let us fast, for our impiety in elevating man's wicked laws above God's "Higher Law." Lt us fast, for the African Slave Trade, and its twin-sister in moral guilt, the slave trade between the States. Let us fast, for our denial of humanity to the black man, and our impious reflection on God's goodness and wisdom in making him black. Let us fast, for the wicked rulers who bear sway over us. Let us fast, for a President whose weakness and imbecility are a direct encouragement to treason. Let us fast, for the corruptions of our Government, and for the hordes of mean politicians who get into office. Let us fast, for our national weakness and folly, for our prejudice and our passion, for our pride and our insolence, for our departure from the ways of the fathers, for our worship of the golden calf, for our treachery to freedom; in short, for that long train of crimes and follies which have led us from the height of prosperity to the brink of destruction!
But mere fasting is not enough. We cannot deal with God as we deal with the politicians. He never makes any compromises. He nothing of the " rights" of wickedness "under the Constitution," or of legal obligations to do wrong. We cannot put Him off with any of our sophisms, or evasions, or prevarications. If we want God to help us in this strait, we must go to work at the bottom. We must stop talking about compromises, and concessions, and catching fugitive Christians, and go to doing right. The Jewish nation once got into a bad way, by reason of just such wickedness as ours-by oppressing the poor and trampling down the rights of the weak. They proposed a fast; and Isaiah (chap. I viii.) denounced them for the sort of fast they got up. "Behold," he says, "in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labors. Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smile with the fist of wickedness" And then, in God's name, he tells them the kind of fast the Lord had chosen: "Is not this the fast that I have chosen? To loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, AND TO LET THE OPPRESSED GO FREE, AND THAT YE BREAK EVERY YOKE." God is unchangeable, and the kind of a fast which became the Jewish people, would not be amiss for our own guilty Nation!
Let us fast, therefore; but let it be such a fast as God can approve and bless.-Lawrence (Kansas) Republican.
AHAB PROCLAIMS A FAST!
The Old Public Fungus at Washington, having perpetrated about all the evil of which he is capable, and involved the country in calamity, civil dissension and disgrace-having in the rankest corruption and venality of which History furnishes any record-connived at the slaughter of a Senator-undertaken the subjugation of a free people with torch and bayonet-permitted systematic piracy on the high seas-given the entire weight of his official power to strengthen and perpetuate the most diabolical system of human bondage known among men-and finally, betrayed the Republic by refusing to protect her fortifications against the depredations of thieves and insurgents-recommends now that we all go to prayers! Accordingly, he proclaims a National Fast.
It is probable that this day which is designated the old Pharisee-and which happens also to be hangman's day-will be made a carnival of cant and hypocrisy at the South, and among the extra-conservative pietists of the North. But what saith the Scripture?-
"Ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high."
"Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break yoke?" [Erie True American. 
MARIE ZAKRZEWSKA,
(PRONOUNCED ZAKSHEFSKA.)
The friends of humanity who are interested in the happiness of womanhood, will gradually learn to assign to the name of Marie Zakrzewska a conspicuous place in their memory, and the exertions attending the conflict with a bristling array of Polish consonants, will only tend to make the retention of the name more memorable.
Marie Zakrzewska was born in Berlin, September 6th, 1829. Her grandfather served in the war against Napoleon I., and founded, in the latter part of his life, a sort of private hospital for invalid soldiers, who, together with their families, worshipped him as their guardian angel. The heroic old man carried on this work of humanity in his own house, by his own, and with the unobtrusive and childlike simplicity, which always attends true grandeur of feeling and action. Marie's father was also a highsouled Polish gentleman of chivalric nature, and her mother was a German woman of great moral beauty. Marie manifested from her earliest childhood a noble independence of character, which afterwards resolved itself into a fixed purpose of directing her energies to the medical profession. Undaunted by the impediments which the prejudices and inanities of society oppose to such a purpose on the part of a lady, Marie succeeded in bringing her studies to a victorious termination, in obtaining her medical diploma from the Faculty of Berlin, and in practising her profession. Penetrated with a strong conviction of the incalculable advantages which women would derive from the medical assistance of one of their own sex, she next resolved on founding an institution in which she would give full scope to the practical application of her designs; and with this purpose fixed in her heart, and amply possessed with the intellectual power to carry it into effect, she came, in 1853, to the United States. Here she had to struggle with adverse circumstances, which she overcame by virtue of unfaltering courage and uncompromising integrity. While her medical skill, and her electric power of imparting her knowledge to other minds, made her a fit compeer of persons of the highest aims and endowments, the first year of her life in America was passed in struggles for her daily bread, and in occupations which brought her into contact with some of the most unseemly and insipid " lords of creation." Her courage, as is generally the case with those of noble spirit, rose in the midst of the most tantalizing vicissitudes. Her original purpose, far from being weakened by adversity, was strengthened by the necessities which she discovered in American life for the application of her science. She succeeded, at length, in founding a hospital in New York (at No. 64 Bleecker Street.) with the cooperation of American lady physicians, and she has lately officiated in a similar position in Boston.
A letter addressed by Marie to one of her friends has just been published, under the title of "A Practical Illustration of Woman's Right to Labor."
A scholar and man of the world, (Count G-y,) celebrated for the comprehensive grasp of his erudite

<c05>
and statesmanlike mind, and for his broad sympathies with the progress of humanity in all its manifold directions, has remarked in regard to Marie's letter:-
"It is instinct with simplicity, and consequently instinct with grandeur. I have read it through at one sitting, with an eagerness and interest, which the most incident in the life of a great hero of humanity could not have inspired in a greater degree. The utmost effort should be made to circulate millions and of copies of this book, among all classes of the people, and in all parts of the world."
It is rarely that real heroes speak much about themselves, and Marie Zakrzewska has, consequently, very little to say about herself. But the little which her letter discloses is immensely suggestive. We do not wish to offer any compliments to Miss Zakrzewska. We might as well undertake to congratulate the nightingale upon her gift of song, as to lavish encomiums upon this lady for her gifts of heart and mind. She has simply and grandly acted up to the highest inspirations of her nature; and next to the gratification which she must derive from the applauding voice of her own conscience, she will find a still greater source of happiness in the thought of having contributed so powerfully to raise the sense the intellectual and moral possibilities of woman's usefulness in the sphere of action generally, and in her own chosen sphere of action, in which benevolence and humanity of feeling, clearness and coolness of judgment, self-abnegation and regard for others, quickness of perception, and skill in execution, must be more harmoniously united than in any other profession. Every word in Marie's letter breathes the divine atmosphere of sincerity and truthfulness, and of the most womanly refinement, culture, and sensibility. Select beings like Marie Zakrzewska are the pioneers of a higher and nobler life of womanhood, and in a far higher degree, even, than that of the celebrated Florence Nightingale; for comparatively few ladies command the pecuniary and social resources which facilitated the execution of Miss Nightingale's charitable project; nor are the peculiar advantages which the mechanism of the Church of Rome presents to the vast army of Sisters of Charity, who for ages past have preceded Miss Nightingale in the work of nursing the sick, accessible or desirable for women generally. No action, no movement, no reform, no benevolent or intellectual impulse, however beautiful or ennobling in itself, can ever take an abiding, influential, and historical position in the life of the race, in the life of humanity, unless it is attended by certain normal conditions, which have the faculty of appealing to the universal mind as powerfully two thousand years hence, as they would have appealed to it two thousand years ago. These normal conditions, unless they establish the pure, unsophisticated, adamantine genuineness and humanity of the action, beyond a cavil or a doubt, fail in their highest aim. Unless they establish the fact that the action springs from the divine life within the soul, they will only result in partial, periodical, temporary conclusions, and never command imperishable sympathies.
But in Marie Zakrzewska's performances we find some of the normal conditions which contain the germs of an immortal influence. Her purpose of consecrating her life to the welfare of her fellow-beings sprung from her noble soul. It was unconnected with any selfish consideration. She bore up, on the contrary, with innumerable mortifications, humiliations, privations, moral, mental, and bodily sufferings, in pursuing her end. She displayed energies of which the strongest man might justly feel proud, and a loving disposition which the most tenderhearted woman would feel tempted to admire and to emulate. She displayed intellectual powers and professional skill in a profession from which, with few exceptions, women have hitherto been excluded. She has at length accomplished her purpose, in the midst of a foreign country, aided certainly by some worthy and congenial minds, but yet beset by difficulties which a foreign language, foreign manners, and an alien mode of thinking and feeling must more or less create. The performances of Marie Zakrzewska will strike root in millions of minds who stand outside the pale of reformatory literature and religion, for they possess those normal conditions of unimpeachable sincerity, honor, virtue, modesty, humility, goodness, courage, intellect, and heroism, which will impress the most ignorant and lowly children of humanity, while they will, at the same time, exact the reverence and admiration of the most cultivated and proudest men and women of the world. Marie Zakrzewska's letter, once sown broadcast among the masses of women and is destined to encourage many poor, struggling girls to bear up their hearts high in adversity, and to make a spirited use of their God-given faculties; it is destined to induce many wealthy and cultivated ladies to make a noble use of their pecuniary, intellectual, and social powers; it is destined to make mean men blush, and to make high-souled men rejoice, at living in a century which offers no better guarantees for the constant and providential improvement of the condition of womanhood, and hence of society, than in the generous impulses and endowments of beings like -New York Christian Inquirer.
AN APPEAL TO THE BOSTON DOCTOR, 
THE APOLOGIST FOR TOBACCO IN THE "ATLANTIC MONTHLY."
SIR,-The Anti-Tobacco cause, for which I labor, is decidedly too poor to pay for superfine language or popular eloquence; hence I address you in a style rather concise, but in words of no "doubtful signification."
Your article in the Atlantic, stripped of its insidious garb, is an APOLOGY FOR THE COMMON USE OF TOBACCO, and, like the gigantic nuisance to which it panders, is highly popular. Wherever I meet a visionary of your profession or my own, a somnambulist of any type who has smoked and dreamed away years of precious life, and designs to smoke and dream away the residue, he is full of its praises. Wherever I meet a genuine dandy, well fumigated, whose elixir of life is expressed by a slight play on tenses,-fumo, fumavi, fumabo,-he utters like praise, and lights his cigar with fresh zest and pride. These, with the sons of smoke on every hand, thank you for raising a rampart around a darling vice, and consign us poor reformers to "the tomb of the Capulets."
Your production, doctor, is doing mischief. Hence I must do the little I can to neutralize the poison which it is infusing into the veins of rising millions.
The outline of your is easily stated. You give us the history of Tobacco and statistics of its consumption, and from its enormous consumption and great popularity you draw the sage conclusion that its influence is innoxious!
You argue, 1. "THAT AN ARTICLE SO WIDELY USED MUST POSSESS SOME PECULIAR QUALITY PRODUCING A DESIRABLE EFFECT." Tobacco, we admit, as an article in Materia Medica, used as a sedative, a laxative, a clyster, a cathartic, an emetic, or when used to kill moths, bugs, or other vermin, does " produce a desirable effect"-just such as God intended it should produce. But never does its produce this effect on man, so long as he stands erect in health and beauty. He must become a sick man, a subject for medicine, before this, noxious poison acts beneficially upon him. A gentleman once said to Dr. Franklin, "Doctor, why have you never used tobacco?" The doctor rejoined: ", I never saw a well man, in the exercise of common sense, who would say that tobacco did him any good: why, then, should I use it?"
If by "desirable effect" you mean that the victim of the quid and pipe, while gratifying his appetite, feels better for the time, I answer, the drunkard, the libertine, the opium-eater, feel better in the gratification of their debauched tastes, for the time, and your logic bids you apologize for every vicious and popular indulgence on the globe, as well as for the practice of this particular vice.
Man, doctor, man in his normal condition, which is allegiance to God, abhors tobacco; and its popular use, instead of indicating any "desirable effect," shows that its devotees have "sought out many inventions." Alas! it shows their stupendous folly in attempting to fill up the void between them and God by abominable narcotics.
You argue, 2dly, "THAT AN ARTICLE SO WIDELY USED CANNOT PRODUCE ANY MARKED DELETERIOUS EFFECT." Its popular use, if I apprehend your logic, is evidence of its harmless character.
Glance at your argument in the light of analogy, and see to what absurdities it conducts you. Fifty years ago, alcoholic drinks were "widely used" in every section of our country; temperance was the exception-inebriety the rule; but was their popular use any evidence that they "produced no marked deleterious effect"? Did they not the incendiary torch, sink ships, and lay unnumbered thousands in dishonored?
Stat nominis umbra.
A genuine Mephitis Americana of civilization.
<c06>
Idolatry is "widely" practiced. Six-eights of mankind, instead of the true God, worship senseless images and horrible deities; but does the popularity of such worship show that it "produces no marked deleterious effect"?
, in all its developed forms, abroad from "sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth;" but does the popularity of sin show that cannot "produce any marked deleterious effect"? 
Such, doctor, is your logic!-the full amplitude of your The orations of Demosthenes, it is said, smell of oil. Your article smells of smoke; and those gentlemen who assigned it a place in the Atlantic, I regret to say, gave evidence of "the deleterious effect" of the weed on themselves, at least, when they disfigured a graceful periodical by admitting an which panders to a loathsome vice.
You, doctor, are without excuse. You know that this drug is a poison. Medical science, the world over, attributes to it the essential elements of a poison as deadly as prussic acid, stramonium, or stryehnine! You know that it is a poison in relation to human organism; that nature unabused sternly repels its first aggressions, and cries, "I will spue thee out of my mouth." You know that you use it professionally as a dernier resort, and with great caution, and that you would not place the of one cigar on the empty stomach of your child for California, with all its treasures.
You know it would prove fatal more frequently, did not constitutional vigor,, perspiration, and expectoration, acting like safety valves, eliminate much of the poison.
You know that, used by the millions, it must produce some effect. The idea that it produces no effect is simply ridiculous. You know that it can produce no good effect on a man in health. It aids neither the power of the mind, nor the strength of the body. The inference is irresistible, that its common use is " evil, and only evil, and that continually." This is undeniable. Still, an educated physician, a sworn guardian of health, in a popular magazine, in a highly elaborated article, the style of which is the seductive "attire of a harlot," tell credulous young men in this happy land that tobacco "must produce some desirable effect," and "cannot produce any marked deleterious effect"!
We confess we lose our when educated physicians, educated in our beneficent institutions, educated on purpose to care for the mighty interests of health, prove recreant to their high calling, recreant, and give the millions to understand that they can use this and other rank poisons with perfect innocency in the sight of God and man. Is the vulgar notion a true one, that physicians in the ruin of the general health? This we are almost constrained to believe when members of the profession become special pleaders for common vices.
Accuse us of an exuberance of zeal in battling an evil which destroys fellow-men soul and body on a wholesale scale! In view of your apologies, we are ashamed of the little we have done; we are ashamed of a heart so lukewarm in a cause so vital to the salvation of mankind.
As White field was once in the midst of an eloquent discourse, three British officers, regardless of good manners, mixed their punch and drank it before him. The orator, dropping the thread of discourse, and raising his hands towards the skies, cried, "I am ashamed, I am ashamed of my in thy service, O Lord, whilst these servants of Satan are so bold!"
But here, right here, sir, we must pay homage to great men of your profession, who denounce this narcotic as a mournful and We are surprised that you count the solid testimony of RUSH, TWITCHELL, WARREN, MUSSEY, and other revered Americans, as not deserving even a passing notice. You parade before us European names in abundance. You bid the "lovers of pleasure" on every hand-princes, poets, maniacs, debauchees and sots-sound the praises of the weed, and fight battle.
How can I do better, doctor, than to close the little I have now to say with testimony tobacco by a few foreign of science and distinction? I begin now, and will finish at a future time:
THE TESTIMONY OF PHYSICIANS AGAINST TOBACCO.
J. B. BUDGETT, M. D., L. S. A., says: "Tobacco is a poison of a most virulent and terrible character. I do not know one of a more destructive in the vegetable, and I believe that a drachm of deadly nightshade would not be more fatal than the same quantity of tobacco."
Dr. PROUT says: "Although tobacco is one of the most virulent poisons, to it to insure its and pernicious Surely, if the dictates of reason were allowed to, an article so injurious would speedily be banished from common use."
Dr. PIDDUCK states that leeches are killed instantly by the blood of; and in no instance is the sin of the father more strikingly visited on his children than the sin of tobacco smoking.
TYRRELL that it is one of those "pleasant vices" which the just gods make instruments to scourge us and proceeds to show that it destroys the very of manhood.
Dr. PAXTON says: "Tobacco is soothing to the nerves-a temporary intoxication. In plain English, it is a poison." He adds: "The sallow complexions, debilitated frames, and disordered digestion of the young men of the present day attest the noxious influence of tobacco. The plant possesses no salutary; its use is subversive of the purely natural functions of life, impairing the finer sensations of taste, smell, and correct feeling."
Dr. HASSEL says, it is an acrid narcotic, and that a few grains cause death. It is a source of intemperance-induces drinking-drinking, jaundice-jaundice, death.
Dr. PUGH mentions cases of amaurosis, softening of the brain, paralysis arising from the nervous prostration induced by tobacco, and thinks, with SOLLY, that the happiness of nations may be jeoparded by the practice.
MAURICE JONES, a surgeon of Narbeth, says: "A greater curse never befell this country than the introduction of tobacco. Let its advocates flourish under their delusion, and may they never rue the day when they yielded to its charms."
Dr. HIGGINBOTTOM, of Nottingham, gives this testimony, after fifty years of extensive practice: "Tobacco in every form has no redeeming property whatever, and at the present time is a main cause of ruining young men, pauperizing working men, and rendering useless the best efforts of ministers of religion."
J. RONALD MARTIN, F. R. S., a great living authority in diseases incident to warm countries, states, from his own observation, that the miseries, mental and bodily, produced by cigar smoking, chiefly in young men, far exceed anything detailed in the "Confessions of an Opium-Eater."
The Dictionaries des Sciences Medicales says: "Parents cannot too much oppose the fearful custom of using tobacco. They allow it without appearing to foresee the evils to which they deliver youth whom they permit to contract this habit."This testimony we can extend indefinitely. We can specify, on sound medical authority, more than fifty diseases which spring from this vile narcotic, or which are greatly by its use. And yet you, a city physician, in this year of GRACE 1860, tell the world that "it must produce some desirable effect," and "cannot produce any marked deleterious effect"! What infatuation! what blindness! The Lord interpose, doctor, to heal your patients, if you treat them as you treat your readers!

"THE UNION, THE CONSTITUION, AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS!" This was the favorite motto of the Belleveretts during the last Presidential campaign, and no paper in this section of the country had more to say about law and order and constitutioned rights than that notorious proslavery sheet, the Boston Courier. Now the editors of that incendiary journal not only uphold traitors and rebels in and out of office, but one of their number, Mr. George Lunt, has become bold enough to declare in shall never be inaugurated, if he can prevent it. The only way the law-loving Lunt can prevent such an act would be to Mr. Lincoln. The fair interference then is that GEORGE LUNT has determined on the assassination of the President elect! We would caution the Awakes to look after this blood thirsty individual.-Boston Atlas.
ANOTHER SECEDER. Col. Harney, the old war horse of the Lousiville Democrat, -and-out Douglas paper, thus secedes:-
"We go with the South. This bite of cold weather has finished us. No reasonable man will consent to go with the colder division. We go with the more moderate climate, and look forward to mild weather as soon as the line is drawn, as did the good old dame when the Georgia line was run and she found she was in that State instead of South Carolina. It was a blessed thing to know it, because she'd 'always hearn tell South Calliny was onhealthy.'"

Refuge of Oppression
TO ALL LAW-ABIDING AND PEACE-LOVING 
CITIZENS
A FOURTH OF JULY UNION MEETING
Having convened at Sharon Center. Medina Co., Ohio, on the Anniversary of the Freedom and Independence of this Confederacy, we wish to improve the occasion by mutual consultation, and an unrestrained and respectful expression of our sentiments upon the measures and policy-which have blighted the interests and blasted the- expectations of our once happy country. We cannot celebrate this day with joy, as we have done in former years. We feel more like mourning over our ruined country, despoiled of unalienable rights and privileges, and likely to be shrouded in the sable festoonery of mourning for the fearful sacrifice of human life in this unnecessary, unnatural, unholy and barbarous civil war.
The inauguration of this war has alienated those who were friends-precipitated the border States to dissolve their connection with the general government-depreciated the value of real estate-ruined our commerce, and rendered bankrupt many of the most enterprising commercial men; and it has also produced a perfect stagnation in every business department throughout our country: and it is fastening upon our government an enormous debt which will require the patient toil and economy of years in liquidate; effectually crippling all our operations for internal improvements: destroying all mutual confidence at home, and producing distrust and dishonor abroad. This frightful state of things could ought to have been avoided by the adoption of 
honorable compromise measures. But Congress, composed of those who were hostile to the Smith, refused to-do anything conflicting with the sectional Chicago platform, and even refused submitting 
the question to the voice of the sovereign people. The action of the Peace Conference, composed principally of "Republicans, being referred to Congress for final action, was ignored by that body. The earnest appeals of Virginia-the mother of States-to save the Union, were hooted at.
Her soil is invaded by the general government. Other States, loyal to the general government, but desiring to be neutral in this fratricidal conflict, have a military espionage placed over them, which has invaded State rights and set at defiance State authority. And all this is done under the most solemn obligations to observe inviolate the articles of the confederated agreement, and the Constitution of the United States of America! All this is destructive of that freedom and independence, for which our sires, on this memorable day, "pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor" to secure, and to transmit unsullied and unimpaired to unborn generations.
Hence we object, most seriously, to the highhanded, unconstitutional, and illegal usurpations of the party in power, which is subversive of sovereignty, freedom and independence. And us quiet, peaceable and law-abiding citizens, we enter our most solemn protest against the spirit and acts of mobocracy, illegally countenanced by the civil authorities, 
under a military despotism; and,
Whereas, some of the peaceful and law-abiding citizens of this county have been grossly outraged by threats of personal violence, for the exercise of rights guarantied to them by the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Ohio, and that said outrages are known to the citizens of our county scat, and in all probability to the officers of the law, who connive at the indignities to peaceful citizens of the county, and make no efforts to suppress the violations of the law by a rampant mob-therefore,
Resolved, That we solemnly enter our protest against all such outrages and violations of law and order, and that we will hold the officers of the law responsible for their dereliction of duty, and for not making every legal and possible effort to suppress the insubordination of mobocracy.
Resolved, That we are opposed to hanging, shooting, assassination, or maltreating men, for their opinions of public men and measures, because we believe it subversive of all good order and government, degrading and enslaving to the noble faculties of intellectuality, subjecting them to the decisions of incompetent and prejudiced judges and irresponsible tyrants, and because such acts are violations of the "higher law" of God's moral government, which says, "Thou shalt not kill," and" thou shall not avenge nor hear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" (Lev. xix. 18): from which it is evident good government is designed to save, and not to destroy human life.
Resolved, That we heartily approve of the farewell addresses of the immortal Washington and Jackson, and that we have, from the first dawning of abolitionism, frowned indignantly upon all attempts of that party to alienate one portion of our country from the rest: and that we will continue to oppose that dominant faction, which has become a frightful despotism, and which, under the mask of Union, is striving to perpetuate its power upon the ruins of our constitutional liberty.
Resolved, That we will suspend all social intercourse with the town of Medina, (except when required to attend the sessions of Court and to the payment of taxes.) and that we will withhold our patronage from the merchants, mechanics, &c., until we have the evidence that the citizens are effectually cured of their political madness, and have recovered the equilibrium of saneness and justice.
Resolved. That we advise and encourage the formation of similar Union societies in every township 
in the county, for the purpose herein set forth.

THE WAR.
The course of events within the last few weeks has opened the eyes of many of our people, especially in the country, to the greatness of the task the North has undertaken, in endeavoring to conquer the 
South; for this is the practical definition of Coercion, or, if preferred, of" Enforce the Laws," throughout the (late) Union. There is as much patriotism as ever, and as great a willingness to submit to privations, hardships and sacrifices, for the sake of the country. But as the people are accustomed to examine their own affairs, and form their own opinions as to the way things are going, so now they are beginning to inquire where is all this to end? What good will it do? Can we bring 8,000,000 of brave people into subjection by force of arms? If we could, what sort of a Union would that be? and what will it cost the North, in, men and money, to accomplish such a result? These and similar inquiries are not confined to these who have always been opposed to the war, but include also some, we believe many, who have hitherto seemed to enter cordially into the war policy of the government. Peace meetings and peace flags are becoming more numerous.
A correspondent of the Boston Traveler, writing from Bradford, Vermont, says:-
"Although there has been no public action in opposition to the war in this vicinity, there are numbers who, in season and out of season, carry their opposition to the administration to the extent of denouncing the war, and in some instances expressing their sympathy with the South."
The action of the Democracy in Ohio and. other States shows that if the war is to be prosecuted on the basis of Abolition, it will lose the support of those who have furnished a majority of our volunteers. The Baltimore Patriot says of the war leaders:-
"They have denounced as weakness and treason the idea of adjusting our national difficulties in any other way than by force of arms and the overthrow of rebels, and they have partially succeeded in their purpose. It may be discovered that, after all their cries to the contrary, they have been working all the time for a. dissolution of the Union."
The Newburyport Herald anticipates that a draft for troops and a direct tax for carrying on the war, each of which it infers will have to be made to insure success, will be so obnoxious as to create a" different state of feeling upon the whole question. "People ever so patriotic, do not like to be turned out of doors or starved, for any national purpose."
The Boston Transcript finds fault with the leniency of the government towards secessionists and conditional Unionists, and says:-
"If it be not rebellion-treason, that we are trying to crush, it would seem most economical, to say the least, to withdraw our forces, break up the blockade at once, summon Jeff. Davis and his associates to Washington, and enter upon an agreement to differ and 
separate!"
The Rochester Union, which has been an earnest advocate of a vigorous war, in the course of an article says:-
"It will not be the most surprising thing in the world if our own capital should yet be taken by the enemy before the administration shall have recognized him even as a, belligerent. The federal civil authorities are decidedly punctilious. They will not make any concessions to the Southern people, lest their action be construed into some sort of recognition of the rebel authorities. They will not recognize the Jeff. Davis power as entitled to belligerent rights, for a similar reason. Hence there can be no exchange of prisoners; but the embarrassment accruing from this abnormal state of things is pretty much all on our own side. And the eventual mortification resulting from such recognition-which must sooner or later inevitably take place-will be all the greater, for being forced upon our government after long and obstinate resistance. This war cannot possibly be terminated in any manner whatever, without at least a recognition of belligerent rights on the part of the Southern Confederacy."
We might quote from other journals, but the above will suffice. We do not apprehend any sudden reaction or popular upheaval, but such premonitory symptoms indicate that the people are beginning to look into their own affairs, and that they will not long be satisfied to lavish their blood and treasure upon a measure which promises "much loss and no gain," as our President Lincoln expressed it in his April Message.-New York Journal of Commerce.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
NEWBURYPORT, July 29, 1861
EDITOR HERALD,-Your leader of this day is just the thing; it hits the nail directly on the head.
We must kill the Abolition party in Massachusetts.-that will do more to show our Southern friends that we are really friends to them, than all other things combined. If we had treated the South respectfully, this disastrous war might have been prevented; but John A. Andrew must send the blackest of Black Republicans to the Peace Convention, and do all in his power to prevent other States from sending Union-loving men.
This war should be stayed as soon as possible. The people will suffer terribly next winter; and if
<c03>
the war holds through still another winter, God only knows what the laboring man and his family will do.
For God's sake, men of Massachusetts, open your eyes and see where this infernal nigger business has brought you; and it will certainly ruin the country, unless the people rise in their might and crush it at once and forever.
Let the ball be started now that in November next will crush out Abolitionism forever, in Massachusetts. 
Yours, truly,
"DOUGLAS."
WALTPOLE, N. H., July 23, 1861.
EDITOR OF HERALD: Sir,-We were right glad to hear-in your issue of to-day and yesterday a ring of the true metal. We looked at each other and asked, has the Herald a new editor. We looked again, and found it was the old editor, again taking a bold stand against the enemies of our country, (the Abolitionists.) and defending the principles of our late lamented statesman, S. A. Douglas. The administration will find it hard to continue the course they have taken in the war in which the country is involved. Had the Democrats of the North taken the course that Lincoln laid out in his Message, (" Let it be shown that a party that can carry an election can put down a rebellion,") the North would have, long ere this, been under the reign of Jeff. Davis. In our town, if a Democrat ventured to express a doubt as to the result of our first battle, he was called a traitor and rebel, and out of forty Wide-Awakes in this town, only two have gone to the war; the rest cannot leave their families or business. Can the merchants of Boston suffer, and continue to suffer, till ruin stares them in the face, and still support that humbug (Andrew)? Will the Democrats continue to preserve the Union, and still be abused by the Republicans? After the Blacks have all got an office, either in the capacity of generals, colonels, majors, &c., &c., or in the capacity of foreign ministers, custom house officers, or any other place to get a good salary from government, then, perhaps, they will remember those who are doing the fighting for the preservation of the Union, and not till then. If all the Democratic <illegible> of the North will take such a decided stand is the Herald has, we should soon see a change; the Blacks would cease their abuse, and treat the bone and sinew of the country with some respect. But until then, they will go on the same as usual.
Let us hear, from day to day, from the Herald, those editorial remarks that will stimulate the Democrats and fall like a bomb-shell in the camp of the enemy. The Herald will be sought for in Walpole with that eagerness that it was through the late Presidential campaign.
THE DEMOCRACY OF WALPOLE.-Boston Herald
SUMNER, WILSON AND ANDREW
The secessionists point to the election of such men as Sunnier, Wilson and Andrew, as evidence of unfriendliness on the part of the people of Massachusetts. We do not now believe, and never have believed, in these men, and shall oppose them, believing them to be unsound. The advocates of the doctrine of non-intervention believe that to be the only basis upon which the country can become again re-united. We believe the defeat of Sumner, Wilson and Andrew in this State would be equal to twenty thousand soldiers in Virginia, and would add greatly to the strength of the Union sentiment at the South, in its efforts to overthrow the disunions. It is of no use for our correspondent to say that he despises abolitionists when he gives to them his vote. When we say there is nothing to fight about, we mean that the disunions have no good reason for the course they are pursuing. They have, however, seized upon the violent denunciation of their institutions and their section of the country, by the ultra-abolitionists, to excite the public mind in the slave States; and point to the fact that these violent men are in power at the North, as evidence that the whole North favors the doctrine they have advocated so persistently for years. We believe the country will not be restored to peace and prosperity until violent men in both sections of the country are set aside. This being the case, should not the true Union men of both sections come together upon the great doctrine of nonintervention, and vote the men who have created this disturbance bores, and give them permission to retire to private life? This is the issue, and it must be met. The sooner it is met, the sooner will the war be brought to a close, and peace prevail.-Boston Herald.
Gen. Butler has written a letter to the Secretary of War about the negroes at Fortress Monroe. If Gen. Butler thinks they are free, why don't he let them run? Why does he continually raise questions, and force the administration to give opinions which may have a bad effect upon the Union? His talk is rich about being a humane man, when he was the head and front of the party in this State to afford protection to slavery in the Territories, and voted in the Democratic Convention for Jefferson Davis for President. At Annapolis, Md., he was for using the United States troops to put down an insurrection which existed only in his imagination. Now he is moved to compassion for the women and children at Fortress Monroe. The whole thing is gotten up so that he can write a letter, hoping to make a little capital for the home market. If he has such bowels of compassion for the negro, would it not be well for him to see that the Massachusetts mechanics and working men under his command are provided with shoes to wear, and have enough to cat? Humane? Bah!-Boston Herald.
GEN. B. F. BUTLER is surprising the people more by his pen than his sword. Ben is a witty fellow, and must make a lion of himself somehow. If he could get into battle he would fight, like a bull pup, and that would satisfy him; but they have kept him in a kind of prison at Fortress Monroe, like Napoleon at St. Helena, where a captain or lieutenant would have held the Fort as well; and not having a chance to fight, he has turned general reformer. Look at his letter on" Contrabands!" He who was the Breckinridge leader of Massachusetts last year, now leads for negro emancipation, and, with abolitionists, puts to shame even Gov. Andrew, whom he leaves a long way behind him. Nor was he content with the enunciation of principles to settle the vexed slavery question. One day he took it into his head to follow Father Mathew's example in temperance, and administered the pledge of total abstinence to all who would accept it. He had not a great character in that line himself, and therefore announced his conversion to begin with, spilled what liquor he could find about the camp, and then signed the pledge and administered it to others. What will be his success in his new field of operations is as yet doubtful; but when he gets tired here they must let him fight, or he will dish up something else for them. Ben Butler is not to keep still.-Newburyport Herald.

From the Silo Champion
THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA
TO IRISHMEN
35 Eels-ST., DUBLIN, 26th June, 1861. It has frequently been my privilege, during the last five-and-twenty years, to address letters to my countrymen on various interesting topics. Temperance, peace, anti-slavery, have often engaged my pen, in earnest appeals to them to take the side of truth and justice, so that Irishmen might always be found in the ranks with those who were laboring for the advancement of civilization over the whole earth. Once more, my countrymen, I appeal to you on behalf of the wronged and down-trodden-on behalf of those who dare not speak for themselves-but for whom you can speak, and speak with effect. I ask you to put forth the power you possess to have justice done to the colored people in America. Now is the moment for Irishmen to prove to the world that they really love liberty, and that they themselves deserve to be free. A civil war is now raging in America, in which Irishmen, who have become citizens of the United States, are taking an active part. This war has been avowedly undertaken by the seceding Southern States for the maintenance of slavery-for the maintenance of that infernal system which places man on the auction-stand, and sells him to the highest bidder, as if he were a brute, or some inanimate article of merchandize. The whole world should rise up in moral indignation against a system which makes man a thing of sale and purchase. This civil war in America has, as 1 have said, originated in the Southern States, for the maintenance of slavery; and the Northern States are indignant, not because such is the object of the South, but because the resolution of that portion of the States which has declared for secession, dissolves the United States into contending parties. This the North asserts is 
rebellion, and must therefore be met by force, and put down with the strong hand. If Northern men came nobly forward with the declaration that slavery should no longer be permitted to exist in any portion of the Union, the sympathies of the whole world would go along with them in the struggle; but no such righteous manifestation has been made by them. Hurt pride, at the insolent bearing of the South, appears to be the sole motive for the indignation manifested by the North; and of the widespread expression of indignant popular feeling, which has resulted in the general arming of the population in that section of the Union. This, feeling is not deserving of the world's sympathy, because it is not based on any noble principle; hence, the approaching war is looked upon, rather as an insane determination on the part of the North to punish a few refractory members of the Confederation, than for the purpose of extending civilization, and establishing liberty throughout their borders. For this reason, no European interest is felt in the issue of this warfare-no one cares which side is the victor. The parties are preparing to slaughter one another, and there is no noble principle actuating either party. What can Irishmen do to make the free States what they profess to be-really free States-and to turn the sympathies of the civilized world on the side of the North? They can do much, both directly and indirectly. Irishmen at home can implore their countrymen in America to take the side of freedom, in its widest acceptation. Every letter that we send across the ocean should be filled with entreaties to our kindred not to disgrace their name or their lineage by fighting for the insane idea that the Union shall be maintained and slavery sustained also. I hold that fighting is always a folly and a crime; but mad and wicked as it always is, it becomes ten-fold worse when it is waged against liberty and justice. We should plainly tell our countrymen in America that they have been too long unfriendly to the rights of the colored people, and that the time has arrived for them to declare themselves the honest advocates of freedom-the determined opponents of any system which puts a shackle upon a single human being. Irishmen in America, you have the power to turn the scale in favor of equal freedom for every American citizen; for the colored man as well as the white man. Your influence is great; exercise it now, in favor of liberty and justice, and you will do honor to yourselves and to old Ireland. If you be false to those principles, if you fight to keep the black man in chains, you will have a blasted character, and your actions will cast a dark shade over the fame of your country. Be not thus unfaithful to truth and righteousness, my countrymen! Ireland has noble memories, which should attach her sons to noble principles. You cannot arrest the progress of man, in his onward course towards a higher civilization; but you may throw some impediments in his way, to your own dishonor. Now is your time to right yourselves in the opinion of the world; if you will draw the sword to maintain the Union, say manfully and nobly, and without a moment's hesitation, that freedom for all shall be at once proclaimed throughout the land. I say to you, fight not at all, for fighting is a folly as well as a crime; and it is in direct opposition to the spirit and to the precepts of Christianity; .but add not to this guilt the sin of shedding human blood for the maintenance of slavery, in the land of your adoption. The curse of God and the anathema of-outraged humanity must visit you for wickedness such as this. Men and nations appear for a time to escape from the consequences of their crimes; but a just retribution comes in the end with the same certainty that the night follows the day. The guilty complicity of all the United States, in the sin of slavery, is now producing the only fruit that could be gathered from such a course of crime. Terrible, indeed, will be the punishment if repentance and restitution for the wrong done for generations, to the colored man, be not at once made by this people. I hope the sword will soon be sheathed, and that the fierce passions now in the ascendant, may soon give place to wiser and better counsels. Slavery is the fountain from whence all these bitter waters flow. Peace cannot be where slavery exists. I am, countrymen, faithfully yours,
JAMES HAUGHTON.

DEATH BEFORE SLAVERY
SPRINGFIELD, VT., June 10th, 1861.
MR. EDITOR:-If the stirring scenes of the past few months have quickened the circulation of the blood, the anticipated events of the future are likely to raise and sustain it at fever heat." We are in the midst of revolution," was the commencement of a speech in the Senate chamber, on a memorable occasion, and we may well adopt the same language but cannot add as did he," hitherto bloodless."
To the inquiry, "What is the cause of all this commotion and preparation to shed human blood?" but one reply in response comes from every tongue,
<c05>
from the legislative hall, the pulpit and the press, down to the school-boy of ten summers: SLAVERY! and any attempt to reconcile the latter with Liberty, civil or religious, is as utterly preposterous as to attempt to reconcile Christianity with profanity and blasphemy. And the moral gulf that divides them, is as wide and deep as that which separates Abraham and Dives. The encroachments of Slavery upon Liberty have been more and more apparent for an age, till it is manifest its end must come, in blood if need be, or your mountains of granite must be leveled, and your mines of iron ore exhausted, to build bastilles to incarcerate all who hold opinions adverse to its claim to reign supreme. 
For a quarter of a century, I have acted and sympathized with a party,-few in numbers, but strong in principle, everywhere persecuted, in Church and State,-'yclept Abolitionists; a cognomen more odious to slave-breeders, man-thieves, and woman whoppers, than traitor, robber or murderer; and little less so with the Lords, the Admass and Dewey's and Van Dykes of the free States. The barbarism of Slavery was never overrated, and never can be. In the eyes of some, the foreshadowing of its overthrow appears. Let it come at whatever cost. My motto is: LIBERTY BEFORE UNION! JUSTICE BEFORE LAW! WAR BEFORE TYRANNY! DEATH BEFORE SLAVERY!
My head is white with the frosts of fourscore winters; but the great Power above that has preserved my constitution and continued my health, almost in the vigor of middle age, may yet deter "marching orders," till I witness the overthrow of Slavery. God's will be done. But I perceive that a great chance must come over the free States, especially over the government, before my hope can be indulged that any decisive steps are likely to be taken in that direction; at least for the present. I am prepared to 
witness, as I have already, scenes enacted by those in authority, which would wring tears of anguish from any thing that had a heart. When six colored men had the courage, inspired perhaps by despair, to attempt to recover the liberty which God gave to man, and in so doing encountered perils and hardships which would nave immortalized
white men, to reach Fort Pickens,-only to be returned by Lieut. <illegible> to the hell of Slavery, to writhe under the torture of five hundred lashes each,-my blood rose to fever heat, and my indignation higher still, to think that I had aided in changing an administration which had been damned to everlasting shame for its corruptions, crimes and war upon humanity itself, only to be repeated by another.
But, sir, I have another case to pass in review, no
less revolting. A Massachusetts General, volunteering his services and those of his regiment-which had been so lately assailed by death-dealing missiles in that modern Pandemonium; alternately governed by the mayor and the mob, at the option of the latter,-to crush out the" vague notions of liberty" imbibed by a race ground under the iron heel of tyrants for ages, and groaning to be delivered. The horrors of St. Domingo dance like a specter before his eyes, and he ignores the fact that they struck for liberty, and that a little white paint would have transmogrified the actors in that drama into Christian heroes and patriots of the first water. He further ignores the fact that the cruel maiming, hot-iron brandings, and burnings at the stake of the victims of tyranny in our own country, far transcend the horrors of St. Domingo. His recent offer to return three fugitives, in exchange for one slaveholder's oath of fealty to the Union, with the fact before him that three, who had taken the oath, were playing the assassin a few hours after, is no amendment of the matter, but rather adds to the heartless turpitude of the whole transaction.(1) A slaveholder's oath!! What is it worth? In the contest now upon us, the thing most to be dreaded is not defeat in a contest of arms, even if repeated a hundred times, but deadly compromise, to bring back slaveholders, with slavery still lumbering at their backs, to be more strongly entrenched than before.
If this be the policy of the government, I have no prayers to offer for its success. The discovery near the close of the last Congress, of so many weak knees and faltering steps in leading men in the Republican ranks, marked a strange and lamentable contrast with their avowed principles and declarations during the presidential campaign; and if ESOPs had lived in our day, he never would have written his fable of the mountain in labor, after witnessing the labors of the Committee of thirty-three, the report of the Peace Convention, and a vote in Congress, two to one, virtually to bind that leprous spawn of Pandemonium upon posterity for all time and eternity too, if it would appease the chivalry; and this latter vote is so degrading and humiliating that posterity will blush with shame at the record, and the future historian attribute it to a demented understanding, or the offspring of fear.
And now, Mr. Editor, I will close this long letter with the following sentiment:-
The Third War of Independence: May it never end, like the two first, with slavery lumbering at our backs, nor the present age dishonored by entailing that leprous spawn of Pandemonium upon the next generation.

GRAPHIC ACCOUNT OF THE FLIGHT FROM
BULL RUN.
The editorial correspondence of Wilkes' Spirit of the Times furnishes the most connected and intelligible account of the battle of Bull Run that we have seen. The writer differs from most of the witnesses, in not attributing the beginning of the disorder to the teamsters or the civilians, but to the soldiers themselves, dispirited by seeing the immense reserves brought on by the enemy, and startled out of their self-possession by the rapid movement to the rear of the caissons of the regulars for a supply of ammunition. His description of the scene is graphic:
"The Burnside brigade was still upon the field, where they had received from Gen. McDowell the news of the victory, and consequently had heard, with the surprise that was equal among all our brigades, the angry reopening of the fight. They had seen, too, the other brigades file off toward the rear, but having no orders for such movement, and not being in the fire, the staunch Rhode Islanders, Wisconsinians, and 71st doggedly held their feet. But the musketry on our side was getting faint, and the great guns of the enemy, unprovoked from our almost exhausted batteries, were now but sparsely fired. Everything, therefore, indicated another lull, and it could not be made certain to our minds but that we had really won the victory after all, and that the last cannonade was but the angry finish of the enemy. Suddenly a cry broke from the ranks of" Look there! look there!" and, turning their eyes toward Manassas, the whole of our drooping regiment, as well those who were moving to the rear, as those who stood, saw a sight which none
<c06>
who ever gazed upon it will forget. At a long way up the rise, and issuing from the enemy's extreme left, appeared, slowly debouching into sight, a dense column of infantry, marching with slow and solid step, and looking, at this noiseless distance, like a mirage of ourselves, or the illusions of a panorama. Rod by rod the massive column lengthened, not breaking off at the completion of a regiment, as we had hoped, but still pouring on, and on, and on, till one regiment had lengthened into ten. Even then the stern tide did not pause; for one of its arms turned downward along the far side of the triangle, and the source of the flood thus relieved, poured forth again, and commenced lining the other in like manner. Still the solemn picture swelled its volume till the ten regiments had doubled into twenty, and had taken the formation of three sides of a hollow square. Our awe-struck legions, though beginning to feel the approaches of despair, could not take their eyes from the majestic pageant, and, though experiencing a new necessity, were frozen to the sight. The martial tide flowed on, the lengthening regiments growing into thirty thousand men, with a mass of black cavalry in its center, the whole moving towards us, as the sun danced upon its pomp of bayonets, with the solemn step of fate. This was war; compact, well-made and reasoning war. It was war, too, in all its pomp and glory, as well as in its strength, and we at once comprehended we were beaten. In vain did our startled faculties dart alertly hither and thither for some hope; in vain did our thoughts turn quickly upon Patterson. It would not do. Johnson was there before us, with his cool, fresh thousands-and our Waterloo was lost. That steady and untried host outnumbered the whole of our worn and staggering columns, and it penetrated us with a conviction of resistless power. Decently, however, did we gather up our force, not by general order, but by one sensible accord, and sad, and pained, and wearied, yet conscious of victory as far as we had fought, we folded up our columns for retreat. The only ones whose hardihood clung spitefully to the strife, were a few regulars at the batteries, who, with the infatuation of experts, and begrimed with the mire of battle from all ordinary recognition, kept peppering at such batteries as would still provoke their fire.
Among the last to turn their faces from the fight they had so gaily sought, were the Burnside brigade, which, accompanied by Sprague and its gallant Brigadier, and headed by all of its colonels, retired in line of battle, with orders to cover the retreat. Thus honored for its steadiness, the Rhode Islanders took off their battery, and the list departed with its guns. All, thus far, had gone well with the departing movement, and our battalions from every portion of the field were retiring with decorum, when of a sudden, some of the persistent regulars, who were charged with the protection of the retreat, getting out of ammunition, sent back their caissons for a fresh supply. I have described how that branch of the service made its charges in the morning, and how recklessly it always sought its way to the front, through the formed columns of the volunteers. In the same manner did it now go back upon its errand, riding down everything in its road, and scattering the ranks of the regiments In every direction. The volunteers, who had never before seen such a sight, and who were already penetrated with the pageant of the descending enemy, could understand the movement in only one way. Those flying carriages, and those madly excited men were rushing to the rear, and their action was therefore construed into a wild retreat. The thought which, appealed to their agitated minds was, that if the regulars were in such haste to escape, it was necessary they should hurry for themselves, and one fearful panic took possession of them all. The ranks of most of the regiments were broken, the streams of flying men commingled; even officers who had behaved with courage throughout the day feit justified, by the precipitation of the regulars, to urge their men, with a sympathizing sense of pity, to hurry for their lives. Thus, mistake piled upon mistake aggravated the misfortunes of the day, and culminated, in a calamity which will rankle in the pride of the republic, throughout all her history. It seems marvelous that men who had borne the brunt of battle so bravely during the entire fight, and who left the field against a courageous foe, with more than equal honors, could have so sunk into such puerile bewilderment; but so it was; and they fled headlong from an enemy more deeply hurt than they, and who hardly dared pursue. The panic soon communicated itself to the teamsters of the Federal army, who improperly had pressed too near, and scampering civilians spread the terror with an electric speed fast back to our reserves.
DEMORALIZING EFFECT OF SLAVERY,
The evil influences of slavery are fully shown in their effects upon the rebels, in order to extend this institution, they have sought to overthrow the government, and to do this, hesitated to use no means which they believe will prove effective. They appear to have completely lost sight of all those moral restraints which area found in civilized communities. They make use of fraud and deceit whenever they think they can profit by them. They hate us so intensely that they outdo the practices of savages. In their warfare with us, they resort to the meanest trickery, and commit the most barbarous deeds. They have not only bayoneted and cut the throats of the wounded; they have not only impaled some and shot at others, as at targets; they have not only shot at women who were relieving the wants of the suffering; they have not only fared upon a hospital; but they have also fired upon a surgeon in discharge of his duty, and even upon the bearer of a flag of truce. They have deluded our troops into an advance by displaying the stars and stripes like friends, and then mowed down our columns with masked batteries. Such atrocities as these are well calculated to arouse the indignation of all right-minded persons. They manifests a spirit of fiendishness unparalleled in modern warfare. They evince a hatred of the foe and a disregard of the dictates of civilization which must win for the rebels the condemnation of the civilized world.
But the strange feature of this savage warfare waged by the South is, that it is waged for the extension of an institution which is claimed to be divine. Because the North opposed this extension it is now treated by the South as a lawless people It has not denied the South any of its rights, but simply because it was unwilling to have an institution extended which it knew was demoralizing and winch it saw was a bar to progress, the South has declared war against it, and war to the knife. If slavery be that Christianizing institution which its advocates have of late years claimed it to be, it is very singular that it should produce upon them such demoralizing effects. Never before has such a warfare as the present one been waged for any Christian institution.
Never before has a Christianizing institution rendered its supporters utterly defiant of all those principles which distinguish Christianity.-New York World.
The United States Constitution is a "covenant with death, and an agreement with hell." 
"What order of men under the most absolute of monarchies, or the most aristocratic of republics, was ever invested with such an odious and unjust privilege as that 
half a million owners of slaves, in the Hall of this House, in the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential mansion?
This investment of power in the owners of one species of 
property concentrated in the highest authorities of the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of the twenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privileged order of men in the community, more adverse to the rights of all, and more pernicious to the interests of whole, than any order of nobility over known. To call, government thus constituted a Democracy is to insult the understanding 
of mankind. It is doubly tainted with, the infection of riches and of slavery. There, is no name in the language of national jurisprudence that can define it-no 
model in the records of ancient history, or in the political theories 
of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. It was introduced into the Constitution of the United States by an equivocation-a representation of property under the name of persons. Little did the members of the Convention from 
the Free States imagine or foresee what a sacrifice to Moloch-was hidden 
under the mask of this concession."-JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.

MASKED BATTERIES.
This new mode of carrying on war by means of masked batteries, is a little more inhuman than any mode to which resort has as yet in the world's history been bad. If anything was wanting in order to make war wholly and completely horrid; if hitherto there has been a deficiency in the fiendish and satanic department of war; the modern masked battery has supplied the want and made up for the deficiency.
Of course there can be no complaint, if it is admitted that all means of attack and defence are allowable and justifiable in the prosecution of war. We enter no complaint. We would only have our readers look at the chivalrous Southrons as they appear in connection with these masked batteries.
How they boasted and bragged before the war begun of their superior prowess! One gallant Southern knight could whip a dozen mean-spirited Yankee militia-men! A whole regiment of psalmsinging puritans would be put to flight by a single troop of blooded Southerners on their blooded horses! At mere sight of the aristocratic slaveholders, the Northern abolitionists would throw down their arms, and beg for quarter! Before the hot South Carolinians and the haughty Virginians, the cant-in" New England hypocrites would melt like molasses candy in July! The vandal hordes from the North would shake in their shoes, like men attacked with fever and ague, and their craven hearts would quiver like disturbed slaves'-fool-jelly, at the sound of the coming of the proud army of the South! No Italian beggar afflicted with scabies ever so itched as itched the brave Southerners to meet the peddling Yankees, two to their one, in open field fight. No egg in mid summer, was ever spoiling so rapidly, no New York Bowery Mose was ever spoiling so all over, as were the Southern blood and  first family men spoiling for one fight with the depraved Free States army. We supposed after listening to all this brag and bluster, that the Southern army would be found upon the approach of our volunteers, standing in the clear sunlight, all drawn up on some wide level plain, in full and gorgeous battle array; that Southern arms and Southern prowess would have performed deeds of mighty valor, and have achieved most daring and heroic exploits, in fair, open, hand to hand fight; that our soldiers would have been repulsed in every battle; and that finally the few of our men who might have escaped death" on the field, would have been driven back home, their courage all gone, their colors all draggled, the Union all shivered in their hands, and Yankee Doodle clean played out. Such effect had this brag and bluster on some of our people, that they thought it would be wise to surrender before the fight: to pattern after Col. Crockett's coon, and come right down, without having any shooting.
But these high-bred Southern men of such high brag pretensions have disappointed us. Instead of proving themselves to be warriors, they have turned out to be sly assassins and sneaking murderers. They have avoided every opportunity that has been offered them, of meeting our soldiers in fair, open field fight. When but recently we advanced with some twenty-five thousand men. to give battle to their well-nigh fifty thousand, and they fresh and strong, and on their own soil, and familiar with the whole country: we found them - O, what valiant soldiers!-concealed behind masked batteries, and these batteries concealed by stones, timber, earth, grass and even trees, artificially planted. They thus took our men at a disadvantage. When one battery was silenced, and they were driven on the retreat, they halted skulkingly behind another battery that they had thrown up in their rear, and again had the advantage of our men. And so it continued: our men constantly exposed to a most murderous fire, but steadily and bravely standing their ground, and all the while advancing; the bragging Southerners hiding behind battery after battery, and never daring, or very seldom daring to meet our men in fair, open fight. These masked batteries greatly strengthen us in the belief, that in this war the Southern heart is full of cowardice; that the Southern army dares not meet our army on equal ground with equal chances.
It is suggested that our men not only take more pains to discover these batteries, but that they destroy them by setting fire to the woods and grass in advance of their march. The smoke and flames together will drive the cowardly, Sneaking rebels into retreat, or will force them to show themselves in open field. In this way we shall get a chance to teach them that they are no match for Northern, loyal soldiers, and that their safety will be best insured by their quick submission.- New Bedford Evening Standard.

A LOOK INTO A SECESSION MAIL-BAG.
Washington, Aug. 6, 1861.
The most curious and yet saddening sight I have seen is the contents of a Secession mail-bag, taken at Centreville, and filled with Southern letters from all parts of the South, but mostly from South Carolina. I found the mail at the house of a distinguished officer of the United States Army, in whose possession it was placed. All of the letters had been examined, and their contents were mostly social. A single letter, from the Manassas post, mentioned the estimated arrival of troops at Manassas, just before the late battle, at 1,000 a day. This was the only public information of warlike importance. Some of the letters also spoke of the crops, and the general representation was that they were excellent, both of cotton and corn. Provisions, too, seemed to be plentiful enough, but in one letter there was a loud cry for salt, and in others for sugar, coffee and tea, and in another for clothing. One might gather from the total contents also, that there was a scarcity of arms and munitions of war.
But the most striking pails of all those letters was the intensified hate of most of the writers for the Northerners, and especially forï¿½ the Yankees," as most of the Northern people arc called at the South. Beelzebub himself, inspired by all the demons of Pandemonium, could hardly have improvised more bitterness, contempt or passion. The temper of the letters written by the women was four-fold worse than the compositions of the men. In one place the dear creatures," in petticoats, were threatening to get up full suits of female garments to present to the young men who would out volunteer for the war, to put down the mean, invading Yankees! One amiable girl wanted her lover to kill a Yankee or two, and then come home to her arms and heart! Another female, a little more blood-thirsty, bid her lover God-speed in this work of killing' Yankees! Another hoped the horrid creatures would be exterminated on the field of battle! Still another had heard, and feared that the report was true, the horrid Yankees had sent some of their number to Manassas to noculate the Southern army with the small pox!! This good woman had probably heard of two live Yankees who visited Canada, the one shaking hands with everybody, and communicating the itch, and the other following close at his heels, with his boxes of itch ointment which were warranted to cure! At any rate, our South Carolina lady, (an Edgefield woman I believe,) feared that the Yankees would spread small pox, measles, and every other contagious disease, to their excellent and amiable countrymen of the South.
In some of the letters there was a tone of piety mingled with bountiful reflections upon Yankee hypocrisy and rascality. Now and then there was a prayer for peace, and an honest wish that the war was over! Kindness and good feeling toward friends and neighbors at home, with expressions of gallantry for soldiers ï¿½fighting the enemies of the South," were common enough. But toward us poor Yankees, or Northerners, there was no bitter thought nor coarse expression which did not find utterance. Somebody has to answer for all this boiled-down fanaticism and malignity -the teachings of a calumnious press, of vituperative public men, and of a general bad education.
The letters I read were generally not from the so-called better classes of citizens. The school-master, if ever at home, was abroad when most of them were written. The expressions were common-place, and the style as atrocious as the sentiments uttered were generally pernicious and vindictive.-Cor N F. Express.
THE NEGRO QUESTION.
We find the following passage in the proceeding of the House of Representatives:
Mr. Burnett (Dem., Ky.) asked leave to offer a resolution calling on the Secretary of War to inform he House whether there be negroes in the Army of t he United States who have been armed, and whether there are negroes the property of any of the revolted States, who have been used by our army in throwing up breastworks or impediments; and if so, at what places, and the number of slaves employed.
<c02>
Mr. BURNETT ineffectually again sought to introduce his resolution, to which at an early period of the day objections were made. He wished to know whether negroes were employed in the army. He desired to be informed from an official source. He had seen them in uniform, with rifles, bayonets, revolvers and daggers at their side. Why not, then, request the Secretary of War to tell us how many are in the Federal army?
Mr. Curtis asked whether the gentleman had seen any negroes except as servants? Had he seen them in squads or companies?
Mr. Burnett replied that one of the best fighters he had ever known was a Kentucky negro who went to the Valley of Mexico armed by the Federal Government. He did not belong to any company. Mr. Burnett further said, in reply to Mr. Curtis, that he had not seen negroes in armed squads.
Mr. Curtis. Do you believe they accompanied the army in any capacity except as servants?
Mr. BURNETT. I do not know. The question with me is, they were armed like others, and had no business there.
Mr. LOVEJOY. Did not negroes aid Gen. Jackson in achieving the victory at New Orleans?
Mr. BURNETT. I am aware of that.
Mr. LOVEJOY. I am for employing any muscle that can fight. [Laughter.] Adjourned.
Next to the sublime impudence of this Kentucky secessionist, the consideration which is forced upon the reader is the fitness of doing the very thing which he evidently intended to deprecate and denounce. For six weeks past, negro slaves have been employed to the number of twelve to fifteen thousand in throwing up fortifications and digging pitfalls for the Federal army at Manassas Junction. A large number have been similarly employed at Yorktown, Norfolk, Winchester, Pensacola, Memphis, and other strategic points. It is boasted that there are two well-drilled regiments of negroes in Beauregard's army, and it is known that Ben McCulloch has a greater or less number of Indians in his motley crew in Arkansas. Wherever negroes or savages can be employed in carrying on the rebellion, they are employed, and yet this brazen traitor from Kentucky has the assurance to inquire whether there are any blacks in the army of the Union. Mr. Curtis's mild deprecation of Burnett's impudence does not seem to have been the most proper answer that could have been made.
What is the case before us? A pro-slavery rebellion of vast proportions-a rebellion instituted for the double purpose of overthrowing the Constitution and making slavery perpetual. For this purpose loyal slaves are employed in vast numbers and in various ways under the lash. Our own army, through a sense of honor or courtesy too nice to be appreciated by us, is sent forth under a strict injunction not to allow a single negro to come within the lines, on any pretext whatever. Even while this order is being penned, a negro is bringing into a loyal port a schooner which the vigor of his own arm has wrested from pirates whom the Government could not catch, and Gen. McDowell's ink is hardly dry before he finds it necessary to get the information from negroes necessary to conduct his own army with tolerable safety. Finally, he threads his way through roads and defiles, obstructed by negroes, plunges into a honeycomb of batteries erected by negroes, suffers a stunning defeat and loses his command. Those who are accustomed to see Providential causes in all great events, will pronounce, the whole logical, and in accordance with the divine economy.-Chicago Tribune.

IMMINENT PERIL OF A SLAVE INSURRECTION.
JONESBOROUGH, TENN., July 28, 1861.
I take the stage hence for Morgantown, N. C., to-morrow, but will meantime drop you a few lines from this point. My journey thus far has not been altogether without adventure, especially that part of it from Lexington, Kentucky, but of this I reserve details till my return.
The intelligence from North Carolina is of a rather exciting nature. In addition to the general and growing popular discontent at the miserable mismanagement of affairs since the State was plunged into Secession, the most alarming apprehensions are indulged, of a fearful and bloody outbreak of the slaves. For months, this class of the population have been betraying great uneasiness, occasioned doubtless, by the unusual, and to them rather inexplicable military movements about them, and which they not very strangely suppose in some way to concern themselves. There are numerous rumors afloat to the effect that in some of the middle counties, servants have risen on their masters, and that whole families have been brutally butchered at midnight. To these reports, however, I am slow to give credence; I believe they are mostly the creations of imaginations always lively to the latent perils of slaveholding society, and now especially distempered by the aggravated dangers of the times. Butï¿½ where there is so much smoke there must be some fire;" and it may turn out that the facts have not been exaggerated, and that North Carolina, and
<c03>
perhaps the whole South, is on the eve of a most sanguinary and desolating servile insurrection. That such a calamity is intelligently feared is certain: and its horrors may startle humanity at any moment. It is stated that such is the refractory disposition of the colored people of late, in the more largely slaveholding section of the State, and so manifest are the symptoms of contemplated and preconcerted mischief, that an earnest requisition has been made upon the Western Carolinians, for the immediate moving to the disaffected quarter of Home Guards, (who, by the way, are nearly all strong Union men,) to the amount of two or three regiments, for the prompt suppression of the anticipated uprisal.
The white men of the endangered region, capable of bearing arms, with hardly an exception, are absent from their homes in the rebel service in Virginia, taking most of the available arms with them, and the women and children are thus left, by this infatuated desertion on the part of their natural protectors, utterly defenceless against brutalities and outrages, which the heart shudders to imagine. It is a fact of great significance-and I believe it to be a fact, for my informant is perfectly reliable-that the Home Guards have refused to proceed to the relief of their imperiled neighbors, under any other banner than the Stars and Stripes, and upon condition, furthermore, that the Secession flag shall be every where hauled down at their approach. Should an insurrection in North Carolina or any other Southern State, assume the formidable proportions which appear to be threatened in this instance, it would be the manifest duty of the Federal Government to promptly intervene to put it down. We regard the Seceded States as still in the Union, in spite of the pretension of withdrawal made by the demagogues who now bear sway there, and their people are evidently entitled to the protection promised in the National Constitution.
Considerations of wise policy would also dictate this course to the Administration; and there is no way in which the Government could more strongly commend itself to the affections and gratitude of the misguided people of the South, than by an act of such fatherly and beneficent protection. Again, it would discharge its plain duty to the thousands of loyalists, who are subject to a common danger with the insurgents, and more emphatically demonstrate the power of the Government, and to better purpose, than a score of victories over the rebels themselves, upon the battle-fields of Virginia. Should this view be taken and acted upon by the authorities at Washington, the re-assertion of Union sentiments in the revolted States, would be immediate and universal, and the uprising of the blacks would become the providential means of suppressing the unholy rebellion of their masters against the best and most paternal Government men ever lived under, and re-establishing upon firmer foundations than at any time before, this mighty temple of civil and religious liberty which now seems to be falling into ruins, under the parricidal hands of traitors.

The Liberator.
No Union with Slaveholders!
BOSTON, FRIDAY, AUGUST 16,1861.
INDICATIONS OF PROGRESS.
As time advances - as the rebellion and the war instituted by the slaveholders are proceeding to bring forth their appropriate fruits-as Northern men come nearer to a full understanding of what disposition and what principles are formed by the practice of slaveholding, and of the readiness and thoroughness with which the Southern despots extend their tyranny, when occasion serves, from blacks to whites-more and more indications appear that the free States are learning their appropriate lesson for the hour; more and more plainly it is manifested that the doom of slavery is sealed.
The letter of General Butler (which was given in last week's Liberator ) is the most signal specimen of this advancing change. His keen observation sees that the people are changing, and that the causes of this change must necessarily lead them much further in the same direction, and he seizes the occasion to make himself conspicuous in the advance. Hisï¿½ contrabandï¿½ theory was an ingenious trick for an existing emergency, but its consequences showed him that the subject must be considered, approached, and acted on, with seriousness and with energy. However little his good-will may have gone with this movement, he must have the credit of actively and openly entering upon it first of all the people in authority; of preceding the President and the Cabinet in the discharge of a most important duty which they should have fulfilled months before, but which they have been ignoring and evading in a manner as discreditable to their character as to their office. General Butler accepts this duty from which his employers shrink. He speaks plainly of the new ground needful to be assumed, of the reasons which make it needful, and of his personal readiness to act in the premises; and, by demanding explicit instructions upon the very matters which those employers had been evading and ignoring, he obliges them to make some open movement towards a solution of the great problem.
The reply to this letter, sent by Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, instructs General Butler (or seems to instruct him, for the language is circuitous and involved) to receive ï¿½into the service of the United Statesï¿½ all negroes who seek refuge with him, and to employ themï¿½ under such organizations and in such occupations as circumstances may suggest or require," for the benefit of that service, whether their flight be from loyal or disloyal masters. General Butler is required also to keep a record showing the names and descriptions of the fugitives, and the names and characters (as loyal or disloyal) of the masters, and to report to the War Department, at least twice in each month, his action in the premises.
There is in this order from the Secretary of War-just as there has been in all the messages and proclamations of our ï¿½Republican" administration-a parade of faithfulness to the pro-slavery provisions of the Constitution. The Secretary volunteers his opinion thatï¿½ a just compensationï¿½ will be paid by Congress for the services of fugitives from loyal masters, and that this will be paid to the masters, instead of to the laborers who perform the service. Nevertheless, the expressions quoted in the paragraph preceding this plainly authorize General Butler to enroll in the army so many of these fugitives as he shall find or make fit for military service. If he shall do this, giving a prompt and practical illustration of the effectiveness of men selected from these fugitives in a war against those who have hitherto held them in slavery, he will have done more than the whole government have yet done towards bringing this contest to a successful termination. Whether he will do this remains to be seen; but his antecedents authorize the supposition that he will not shrink from vigorously pursuing any course of policy which he has judged it fit openly to commence.
A further sign of encouraging progress is seen in many of those members of the periodical press which have hitherto been adverse to anti-slavery. In them we must recognize vacillation-an occasional mention of slavery as the source of the whole trouble, and needing to be treated as such, alternating with their customary nonsense about carrying on the war solely to maintain the Union and the Government -as real progress. As the war advances, as the burdens of it fall more and more heavily upon the people, as the rebels display more and more of those base and cruel and dishonorable traits of character which have become familiar and customary to them as slaveholders, the change above-mentioned in our Northern editors will increase. They will talk less and less about respecting and guarding theï¿½ institutionsï¿½ of highway robbers. They will hesitate less and less about designating that which is at once the enemy's weakness and wickedness as the chief point to be attacked in this war. Their praise and advocacy of Union will be directed more towards a prospective union of those who prize freedom for all, and who wish to found their government on that idea, than to that past, merely nominal union, which absurdly attempted to combine
<c04>
slavery with freedom, and which has cherished the former well-nigh to the ruin of the latter. Every new instance of a flag of truce fired upon by the rebels-every new battle after which our wounded are bayoneted by them -will cause more and more of these hesitating manufacturers of public opinion openly to say, Slavery must now be overthrown and exterminated! It is time to crush the viper whose growth we have been so foolishly cherishing!
Another indication of progress is seen in the condition and attitude of the more persistently pro-slavery Northern newspapers. Some of these (like the Courier of this city) are reduced to the necessity of crying out for help, and of representing large and speedy extra contributions as indispensable to their continuance. Others (like the New York Journal of Commerce) are redoubling their efforts for compromise, working with a zeal which seems to show them seriously fearful thatï¿½ their time is short." The paper last-mentioned dwells upon the evils of open contention, as if that were worse than the quiet continuance of an alliance used to betray and ruin us; it enumerates the taxes which war will bring, as if these were worse than the continual eating out of our very vitals by slavery; it laments over the diminished congregations in the churches at Washington, as if the forms of public worship were more important than the substance of religion, and as if prayer for peace were more important than work for righteousness; and the one thing which it finds to rejoice at is the establishment of a new paper in Cincinnati, called The Banner of Reunion, devoted to the advocacy of Compromise.
In my judgment, these various and diverse signs of the times, point to successful progress far rather than to discouragement and retrogression.-C.K.W.

CELEBRATION OF THE FIRST OF AUGUST AT ABINGTON.-[CONCLUDED.]
afternoon session. At 2 o'clock, the meeting was called to order at the Town Hall, when it was stated that there was a very large gathering of people at the Grove, and a motion to adjourn to that place was put, and carried. Shortly after, the President (Mr. Garrison) took his position on the platform at the Grove, when the exercises of the afternoon were commenced by the singing of a hymn, ï¿½The Slave," to the air ofï¿½ Scots wha hae," of which we give the opening stanza:-
" Lo! in Southern skies afar,
Mounted on Oppression's car,
Hides a pale and sickly star-
God of Slavery!
Misery, with ghastly train,
Dealing horror, woe and pain,
Sweeps along his fell domain,
Like the troubled sea."
The names of the Finance Committee were then read, and they proceeded to the discharge of their important duties, while the President addressed the meeting. He said the impression seemed to prevail in some minds, that there was a disposition in the ranks of the Abolitionists to consider their work so wellnigh accomplished, that they had nothing to do but to stand still and suspend all action; but he was not aware of the existence of any such feeling. There was no design, on the part of those who had the management of this cause, to abate one jot or title of their purpose to see that slavery is utterly abolished. He thought they had need of increased vigilance. They were in the midst of a great and solemn crisis; and if the nation was to he saved, it would be, under God, by the Abolitionists-by those who are resolved to make no compromise with the Slave Power, but to demand, in the name of the living God, that every slave shall be set free: proclaiming in His name, and by His authority, that, for this people, there is neither peace nor prosperity, so long as a single slave is left in his fetters on our soil. He hoped they would do all that they could, at the present time, by way of contributions, to aid the efforts that would be made by those to whose hands the management of the cause had been entrusted.
Mr. Garrison then proceeded to speak in reference to the war. We had vain-gloriously imagined, he said, hitherto, that, as a nation, we were invulnerable and immortal. All the warnings of the friends of the slave had been laughed to scorn, and it had been supposed that by no possibility could any harm come to us, as a nation. But now, the most tremendous civil war that the world had ever seen was raging between the North and the South-the pillars of the government were trembling-and men's hearts were failing them for fear. What was the cause of this state of things? Every intelligent and honest man knew it was SLAVERY. If, therefore, they hoped to have peace, prosperity and safety, the war must not be terminated until, liberty be proclaimed throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof." Freedom was loyal to righteous law and just government. The conspirators were slaveholders and slave-breeders, and slave-hunters, and only these. They were the party who were seeking to establish a reign of despotism which should blot out all our free institutions, as well as perpetuate slavery on Southern soil. They hate, and proclaim that they hate, all that pertains to freedom; and when the black banner of slavery should be hoisted triumphantly here, as it was in Carolina and Georgia, all our democratic institutions would be overthrown. What, then, was the obvious duty of the government? Evidently this-to declare that, in as much as it is slavery that has committed this treason, the government, under the war power, and as a matter of self-preservation, must abolish slavery. Until that was done, in his judgment, nothing was done; nothing but the shedding of blood in vain; nothing but the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars in vain. He held the South to be perfectly invincible so long as we protected or respected her slave system. The South felt that she was unconquerable, and would be in the end triumphant, because she saw that we were still bewitched by the sorcery of slavery, declaring, even in the midst of our sufferings, losses, bereavements, and enormous expenditures of money, that we have no wish or intention to interfere with her accursed ï¿½institution." But let this government write the motto on her banner, ï¿½Freedom for all who shall rally under the Stars and Stripes! ï¿½and in that hour the death-blow is given to treason and secession.ï¿½ Where there is no fuel, the fire goeth out." The South dreaded nothing so much as the liberation of her slave population; she dreaded it more than she did the armies of the North, because a retributive Providence has so ordered it, that the knees of the oppressor shall smite together in the presence of his slave standing erect as a man. The slaves must be called upon to save us, themselves and the country; for they alone could do it. This would be a noble and glorious return for all the wrongs and outrages that have been inflicted upon them.
What infatuation, as well as wickedness, in our government, still seeking to maintain and perpetuate slavery, by compromise, under the old ï¿½ covenant with death," when that covenant is trodden under foot by the Slavery, and discarded forever by them! Let emancipation be proclaimed! He held it to be not only a wise stroke of policy in war, but the imperative and Christian duty of the Government to do this. God had commanded us to  execute judgment in the morning,"-that is, without delay,-and to  deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, that His fury might not go out like fire, and burn because of the evil of our doings." In the altered state of affairs, a solemn obligation rested upon the people and the Government to emancipate those who are pining in bondage; and not to do this was to be guilty in the highest degree. They had a right to do it. The South was in hot rebellion, endeavoring to subjugate the whole country to her diabolical will. Under the war power, the Government had a right to consult its safety and the general welfare by removing the source of danger and division. Even if it were a destructive work to be consummated,-like burning their towns and cities, or confiscating legitimate property,-it might be done to any extent, under the
<c05>
rules of war. But it was to do no violence, and commit no outrage. On the contrary, it was to perform a work of inestimable beneficence and imperishable glory. It was to ï¿½break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free;ï¿½ and thus to do the greatest possible benefit to the South;" to return blessing for cursing, good for evil, and to bring salvation to the whole country. This great act of justice would certainly disarm and suppress the rebellious slave oligarchy, and bring the war speedily to a close. He held, therefore, that the only thing the friends of freedom had to do, there and every where, was to cry aloud, in thunder tones, to the Government, to lose no time in proclaiming to the millions in bondage in the South, that, as soon as they can place themselves under the national flag, they shall find their freedom, and be protected in it. Otherwise, he did not see a ray of hope for the North, or any part of the country, so far as the war was concerned. None but the slaves could conquer the South, and that, not by the bloody process of insurrection, but by proclaiming their freedom under law. When slavery was abolished, the cause of the war would be gone, and the slaveholders would have nothing to fight for. This was to lay the axe at the root of the tree, and to bring it at once to the ground.
The nation, said Mr. Garrison, in conclusion, is just as near destruction as it can be, and yet be saved. God knows whether its salvation is possible or not. But I say again, deliverance to us all must come, if at all, through those who are in bondage. We have outraged them in every possible manner; we have made them marketable commodities; we have herded them with four-footed beasts; and now, in the extremity of our suffering, we must look to them to save the republic by restoring to them their wrested rights. Joining their forces with those of the Government, they will strike terror to the hearts of the tyrant, and peace will soon be restored to our bleeding and dissevered country. My friends, our word must be-Emancipation for all in bondage! Emancipation under the national flag! Emancipation under the war power! Emancipation, because it is a matter of necessity, because it is right, and because it is our imperative duty before God. (Applause.)
Henry C. Wright said he had a short speech to make, which he would put in the form of a resolution, as follows:-
Resolved, That slavery is the cause, and abolition the only cure, for the evils that now overwhelm the nation; and the sooner the people of the North accept that as the issue which they are called to meet, the better for all the people throughout the nation and the continent.
the president. As many as are in favor of adopting Mr. Wright's speech will say Aye." (A loud shout of ï¿½Aye.") It is an unanimous vote. We are all ready for emancipation, thank God!
Andrew T. FOSS, of New Hampshire, was then introduced the said he had often appeared before an anti-slavery audience, and he believed never with a lengthened visage. He had always been hopeful of the success of this cause, and never could doubt that it would have even an early triumph. But never had his hopes been so strong or his feelings so exuberant as they were now. He believed that their work was about culminating, and that they were to see in their time, what does not often fall to the lot of those who commence a great reform, the fulfillment of all their prophecies and the realization of all their hopes. He believed that in their day, they were to see every slave in the land a free man.
He was full of hope and expectation, because he saw the North and the South arrayed against each other in battle array. He knew it was not an anti-slavery war, and that the government had declared their determination to preserve their covenant with death and agreement with hell." But there was a power in the world other than the Constitution of this land. The American people and church did not believe in a ï¿½Higher Law"; they believed that the Constitution of the United States was the highest authority in the universe. He believed that there was a ï¿½Higher Law," and that that ï¿½covenant with death and agreement with hell" was annulled. He did not believe there was virtue enough in the American people to abolish slavery. The voice of God, calling upon them to let the oppressed go free, had been unheeded. But they had passions, if they had not a love for truth and justice. This war had made a great many converts to anti-slavery, and among them, many of the clergy. Now, Dr. Adams was an abolitionist-gone to bed with Mr. Garrison (laughter and applause)-and Dr. Kirk, even, was praising his (Mr. G. 's) principles. He felt about them very much as the good old mother in Israel felt about one of her grandsons, who had been a very bad boy, and made a great deal of sport of religion, but who went to hear Mr. Maffit, and was converted. She went over to him, just as he was sayingï¿½ Glory!!ï¿½ Glory!!ï¿½ and exclaimed-" Don't you come out yet; you have been too great a sinner. You ought to eat more of the bitter yarbs of repentance!" (Great merriment.) So I say, they ought to " eat more of the bitter yarbs of repentance;"-but out they come! (Renewed laughter.)
He believed that all this stir and commotion meant freedom to the slave. But he felt that it was a very solemn thing to be surrounded by circumstances such as those in the midst of which they stood to-day. He did not feel light-hearted in view of the fact that thousands of his fellow-men, in the South as well as the North-for they, too, were men; even those who bayoneted the wounded on the battle-field were his fellow-men-must be slain in this war. It was sad and terrible to think of it. But what was the cause The cause was slavery. Yet the people did not understand it. Stephen A. Douglas had said that this was not a ï¿½nigger" question, but a question of the life of the government. But how came the life of the government in danger? Not from any cause under heaven but slavery. It was the slaveholders of this land who were the rebels, and in arms to-day against the government, and if all the slaveholders should lay down their arms, there would be no contest whatever, If, thirty years ago, the American people would have heeded the word of Mr. Garrison, this question might have had a peaceful solution. If, when the Constitution was formed, our fathers had believed in right and justice, and made the Constitution for freedom, excluding slavery, we should not have been where we are to-day. It was too late now-the time had gone by.
Something had been said in regard to whether they should go on with their operations. By all means. Every averment that had been made by the Abolitionists in regard to slavery for thirty years was now proved and demonstrated before the eyes of all men. This was the time to keep the eyes and ears of men open. Nothing but the anti-slavery sentiment could save the government from compromise. He did not feel very much concerned in his mind in regard to what the government intended or what measures they pursued in this matter. It was not for the government to say what shall be the issue of the war. They might decree that not a slave should be freed;-they could not help it. He did not believe that Abraham Lincoln or Gen. Scott, so far as the issue of this war was concerned, had much more influence upon it than a cab-driver in the city of Washington. They were determined to re-inaugurate the old Union, but it was not in their power to do it. Events ruled, not men. President Lincoln said he would not invade the soil of the Southern States; but now he had little less than a hundred thousand troops there. He had been forced to do what he did not intend to do. The bill just passed by Congress in regard to the confiscation of rebel property was capable of being construed into an act of emancipation that should free every slave in the land. He knew the government did not mean it; but he knew also that it could not help it, and every slave should yet be free. God always took care to have us run in the right direction, take what course we would. The slave was to have his freedom; and when he had his freedom, he (Mr. F.) would have his jubilee. They should all yet rejoice in the freedom of the slaves. It was true, that clouds, heavy and
<c06>
black now hung over the land, but he saw the sunlight of liberty shining through the rifts. Those clouds would roll back, and we should see the day of peace and of freedom; and then the Abolitionists would take an interest in the institutions of the country, and be like other men. But until the slave was delivered, he, for one, did not mean to be like other people. He meant to be a despised and hated Abolitionist, making all Hunkerdom mad. (Laughter and applause.)
I give you my word of cheer, said Mr. Foss, as he took his seat ï¿½The Lord liveth; let the earth rejoice!" (Applause.)
PARKEEER PILLSBURY was the next speaker. He commenced by reading the following resolution:-
Resolved, That a ï¿½United North,ï¿½ to defend the present Constitution, is no evidence, or necessary indication, of hostility to slavery; but instead, while slave in surrections are to be suppressed, in the fearful words of Gen. McClellan, ï¿½with an iron arm," and confiding fugitive slave men and women are to be driven back, by hundreds at a time, to their tyrant masters by Northern generals, and so-called loyal citizens, as well in ï¿½ secededï¿½ as in ï¿½ border States", are assured by the President (since the war, as before) that they shall be religiously protected in their slave property, and their system constitutionally and irrevocably perpetuated by act of Congress, not withstanding the war, we are left to fear and to believe, that should the whole adjustment of the present controversy be left to the powers that now direct and rule, the result will be all the disastrous calamities of a terrible war, with no possible gain to Humanity and Freedom.
Mr. Pillsbury said that Mr. Phillips had criticized the government, in the morning, with great force and great justice, as he thought, and he was ready to adjourn, sine die, at the end of his (Mr. Phillips's) speech. He thought the people had just cause to suspect the government or treason. He had no belief that there was a man who had any idea of proceeding even to extremes we had already reached. The North had hitherto been controlled by two classes of men: political aspirants, who sought to turn the presenttide of affair, to their advantage; and the army contractors, as destructive and loathsome as the ï¿½army worm" which had recently made its appearance in Massachusetts. The ten plagues of Egypt would scarcely increase the calamity when we had them both! (Laughter.)
The people, Mr. P. said, were allowing themselves to be deceived with the idea of anï¿½ united North." It was true, the North was united; but it was still a Union and still to be a Union with slavery and slaveholders. Hitherto it had meant nothing else, and we were indebted to the South for whatever progress had been made; and if the South continued to act her part as favorably towards us as she had done, whatever victory was achieved, we should at last owe it to her. But for the cannonade of Fort Sumter, there would have been no beginning of the present war. But for the mob in Baltimore, there would have been no increase of the seventy-five thousand men originally called to the field. But for the attempts to poison the troops with strychnine and Virginia whiskey, (the strychnine getting the worst of it in the compound,) and the piratical enterprise of Jefferson Davis, there never would have been that Northern uprising which we had to-day. Then the government was indebted to the Virginia Legislature for relieving the departments at Washington from traitors. They passed a law exiling them forever from the State if they remained, and there was a stampede of clerks out of Washington, just as there was of slaves to fortress Munroe. It had been said, when the question was asked why they had been permitted to retain their offices, that the public interest absolutely required it. Now that they had gone, he supposed theï¿½ public interest" would subside. (Laughter.)
What the government had done hitherto had tended far more to sustain and defend the South than to defend the government, as a whole. He did not believe there was any intention to carry forward the struggle in the sense which Mr. Foss supposed, and he thought the public ought to be cautioned against all these fair appearances. He did not know but slavery would be abolished by this war, but he was very far from expecting any sympathy, much less countenance, from the government in such a measure. He should as soon have thought of fraternizing with Pilate and Herod because out of the crucifixion of the Son of God might come the salvation of the world. It seemed to him that, in view of the action of the government in regard to the slaves, that they had something else to do besides assuring themselves that ultimately, in the administration of the Divine government, the slave system of the country will be overthrown. He saw no sign of the abolition of slavery. On the contrary, he saw every sign of all the horrors and calamities of the most frightful civil war known in history, with no good whatever to result from it at the end.
Mr. P. thought that, since the battle of Bull Run, the public sentiment of the North had retrograded, and in confirmation of his opinion, read an extract from a letter in the Boston Herald, in which the writer says, among other things, that the Abolition party must be killed in Massachusetts, and that that would do more to show our Southern friends that we are really friends to them, than all other things combined"! He also read from an editorial in the Herald, in which it is declared ï¿½The Herald will oppose all attempts to make this an Abolition war, or to foist upon the country the dogmas of Sumner, Wilson and Andrew. These men have done mischief enough. The war should be brought to as speedy a termination as possible, having a due regard to our national honor." While the distress and suffering and poverty created by the war were increasing, it became them to attend to this under current of feeling which finds voice in such organs as the Herald and the Journal of Commerce in New York, and the Boston Herald.

Our government was a failure. There was no man in it. The hour had come, and there was no man equal to the emergency. We had at the North nineteen or twenty millions; and yet Diogenes, with his lighted lantern at noon-day, would search as hopelessly for a man among these millions as when he searched the streets of Athens for the same purpose, two thousand years ago. The politicians who controlled public events had no anti-slavery heart in the matter. He doubted not that Abraham Lincoln would rather abolish slavery than see it continue, and believed that the majority of Northern Democrats would be glad to get rid of that which had been the ruin of their party and of so many other parties; but then, they were without a controlling element at the centre. They were a great body, but where was the soul? There was no direction, no capability, and, what was far worse, no honesty and no integrity. Politicians and parties had been tried before. The Whig party had been tried, and the cause of humanity owed more to the Whig party, in the day of its departure, than it owes to the Republican party. There was no Republican party now. The only issue that separated them from the Douglas Democracy had been abandoned, and their action in regard to the organization of the Territories showed that they cared no more than Douglas whether slavery was ï¿½ voted up or voted down."
We had had, so far, the most convincing proof that the politicians had deceived us, intentionally, from the beginning. They had said that the South could not fight if she would, and would not if she could. When the South began the secession movement, they had declared that she was not sincere. He thought she was sincere; and warned the people to be ready for sincere action on her part. He told the Republican party that though they had succeeded at the ballotbox, there was yet another issue to be met, for their ballots were but the paper currency that was to be redeemed hereafter by a specie payment in solid bomb-shells and bullets; and they mobbed him for the declaration and the warning. The mob spirit pre-

vailed throughout the North, until Abraham Lincoln had to avail himself of the underground railroad to escape a mob; and a mob had ruled him and his administration to the present hour, and proposed to rule still.
Mr. P said he knew these might be called discouraging words, bat they were not discouraging to him. The truth was, they were deceived, and it was time that they knew it. The government intended compromise-nothing more. There were traitors in the Cabinet as well as in the army. There were traitors even in our midst, as well as in Baltimore and the border States, and when the hour came, that treason would make itself heard and felt. Events had led the government thus far, as signally as the pillar of fire by night and of cloud by day led the children of Israel out of the bondage of Egypt; and it was for the people still to command events. He remembered that Mr. Phillips once said it was the business of a statesman to know circumstances. He went beyond that, in his estimation of statesmanship, and thought it was the business of a statesman to shape circumstances and to control them. Slavery was the cause of this calamity as everybody was convinced. Then what would an enlightened statesmanship, a pure Christianity and a sound policy dictate in regard to it? He should think, the removal of slavery, as the cause of the evil. Yet where was the statesman who dared approach the subject in that light? Now, there was a proportion for a new compromise committee. He had seen the names of Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce mentioned, and expected, as he read along, to see the name of Lot's wife, and two or three mummies from the catacombs of Egypt. (Laughter.) What did such things as these indicate? Anything like earnestness of purpose? No. The government meant to sell out the people; and they had more to fear from their government than from Jefferson Davis and all his army. He did not know where the sensibilities of the people were; waiting-waiting-looking to the Cabinet and the government for aid and deliverance! I tell you, said Mr. P., the earthquake, the whirlwind and the fire have not the still small voice of the spirit of God in them; and when they shall have passed away and done their fearful work, if we also allow ourselves to be deceived, there wilt be none left in that day of disaster to lift up the standard of the spirit of truth and of God.
Mr. P. then proceeded to speak of the battles of Great Bethel and Bull Run, the former of which he called a blunder, and the latter a great deal worse. It was downright murder, he said; and the blood of the slaughtered soldiers hung heavy on the skirts of Abraham Lincoln and all his Cabinet. The South, according to military men, had not made a single military blunder yet. He told the people, when they first commenced these military operations, that they meant nothing; they would have appointed better instruments if they had intended or expected to light, What did Gen. Butler know about military operations? Great Bethel could answer that. What reason had they to expect anything better of Nathaniel P. Banks? When he saw men professing to be engaged in an earnest cause appointing such instruments, he knew they were heartless, if nothing more, He did not believe there was ever a time when the Abolitionists were so much needed as to-day; and he was fur enough from believing that the martyr age of the Abolitionists was past. When compromise came to be the order of the day again, he wondered what Mr. Philips's life would be worth? Let the Abolitionists then beware!
Until we make our cause such, said Mr. P., that we shall be glorious, even in defeat, we shall not be worthy of victory. We have enough at stake, so that we might be defeated in a hundred battles and yet be the admiration of the world. Instead of that, a victory that would eclipse Waterloo, and entirely drown out the proudest achievements of Bonaparte, would only redound to the infamy and disgrace of a people who made war to sustain a government the design and object of which is the propagation and perpetuation of slavery. I have no higher opinion of Abraham Lincoln, and his Cabinet, and the clerks in the various departments, than I have of the President and Cabinet and clerks of the Confederate States. They have told us out, and they expect the Union and the continuance of the government to be their reward. It remains for you to say whether it shall be so. I want to see earnestness on the part of the people. I want to see conventions called to express the opinions of the people. The President will act when the people command, and command in the peremptory tone which the South has been accustomed to use whenever she has been obeyed by the North. The other My, a question came up which it was said the President had "under advisement." What did that mean? Why, that he was waiting to see what New York, and New England, the West and Northwest would say. But New York and New England see nothing but the glory of the war; and that very war is to be the destruction of liberty in this country. We have not a man to gather up the forces of humanity and concentrate them in one invincible thunderbolt against the infernal institution; and until we have, why, falling on that rock, we are already broken; ere long, it shall fall upon us, and grind us to powder. (Applause.)
MR. GARRISON said that perhaps the true position to be taken would lie between that indicated by the hopeful and jubilant speech of Mr. Foss, and that of Mr. Pillsbury, which was somewhat sombre and depressing, He (Mr. G.) certainly thought there was a very broad difference between the position of Abraham Lincoln, and that occupied by Jefferson Davis; between the issue presented, as it respects free institutions, on the one hand, and the rule of the Slave Power on the other, to the subversion of all freedom. He knew that the attempt was making by the government to preserve the old order of things; but that I was impossible, for the reason that the South would take nothing less than what she demands, and she demands so much that the North, with all her pro-slavery tendencies, would be unable to get down low enough to effect a reconciliation.
But they were asking the government to abolish slavery. It was a very easy thing for them to say, "Mr. Lincoln, why don't you proclaim emancipation to the slaves in the South, and thus conclude the war?" But will the North sustain him in doing this? Mr. Pillsbury had said he believed that Abraham Lincoln would rather see slavery abolished than have it remain. Jefferson Davis would rather see slavery established, and freedom abolished. That was the difference between the parties. Then, why did not Mr. Lincoln abolish slavery? Probably, because he was not yet convinced that he would be sustained by the popular feeling of the North, without which he could do nothing. He (Mr. G.) believed that the Cabinet would to-day make a proclamation of freedom to the slaves of the South, if they could only be assured that it would be sustained by the popular sentiment. The question was, were the people disposed to forget party names, at this crisis; and did they see that, unless emancipation be declared, the nation is going down to irretrievable ruin? He had his fears in regard to it; still, he would have the proclamation made, because he believed it would be well pleasing to God; because he knew it would be right; because he was satisfied that, under the war power, it would be abundantly warranted; and because he believed that such a measure was the only hope for the country. If the slaves were not emancipated, insurrection must follow civil war or accompany it; for when the slaves found that there was no hope for them through the government, they would rise in their despair and desperation, and we should have a servile as well as a civil war to curse and desolate our land.
Mr. PHILLIPS was loudly called for, (many being present who did not have an opportunity to hear him in the morning,) who came to the platform, and made a short speech, following the same general train of thought as in his previous remarks. He was heard with great pleasure, and warmly applauded throughout
<c02>
The President then said, that whether the audience were prepared to endorse all the views expressed by Mr. Pillsbury or not, he had no doubt they would heartily endorse the resolution presented by him.
The resolution was again read, and adopted, with only two dissenting votes.
Miss MARY GREW, of Philadelphia, was then introduced by the President, as one who had long been a noble advocate of the glorious cause.
SPEECH OF MISS MAET GREW.
When Mr. Phillips told you that State street and "Wall street demand now the abolition of slavery, for the salvation of trade, he might have added that Market street and Third street, in Philadelphia, join in that cry. Pro-slavery, slave-hunting Philadelphia, whose name you have connected with memories of Judge Kane and Commissioner Ingraham,-God has taken them to himself-Philadelphia now swells that loud cry from all our commercial cities, "Give us the abolition of slavery, because we cannot live without trade!"
If there are, on the face of the earth, any people who have a right to exult to-day, Mr. President, it is surely the American Abolitionists. Who, if they may not, has a right to sing "Glory to God in the highest"? For we stand in the midst of our fast-fulfilling predictions, and see God's retributive justice proving that "His mercy endureth for ever." Thirty years ago, nearly, a few Abolitionists in this land stood up and declared to the nation that they were going to abolish the mighty institution of slavery. They were few, and, as the world counts weakness, they were weak; but they said to the nation, strong, and proud in its strength, "We will strike, down to death this institution which you cherish and in which you trust." And the nation laughed them to scorn. Their opponents (and who were not their opponents?) confronted them with the strength of the Church, with the power of the government, with the wealth of the commercial classes, and proved most conclusively that all these were against them. They pointed to the literature of the land, to the intellectual strength of the land, and demonstrated, so that they thought there was no reply, that all this force was against the Abolitionists, who arrayed themselves in opposition to this mighty institution; and, thus confronting us, and thus pointing, on this side and on that, to the weapons of our adversaries, they said, as host after host marshalled themselves against us, " How do you expect to succeed, in the face of all this, and in spite of all this? " Undaunted, the Abolitionists calmly replied, "In the face of all this, and in spite of all this, and more than this, we expect to succeed, because' the Lord God omnipotent reigneth'!"
Now, where stand we, after nearly thirty years of labor and of battle? We said, in the outset, to this proud nation, "God gives you your choice between the peaceful abolition of slavery and the dissolution of your Union; between doing justice to the slave and dismemberment." And they laughed us to scorn. To-day, the Union is dismembered. To-day, that proud nation, which, a quarter of a century ago, said, " I sit a queen, and shall see no sorrow; who is the Lord, that I should obey him, or hearken unto his voice? " is broken in pieces. To-day, we need utter no word to prove our predictions true. They are fulfilling themselves before our eyes; and that proud Union, instead of boasts, has taken up the cry and wail of distress, and now is struggling for life. Slavery, which it cherished, and against which we fought, now points its guns at the heart of the nation, and which shall go down in the struggle, God only knows.
But wherefore do we rejoice? It was said hero just now, that they who are fighting our battles, or the battles of the nation, are not fighting for the freedom of the slave, and do not care to abolish slavery. Very likely they do not. It is not, and never was, in this nation's heart to do this thing. They may not mean it; but God does, and he, not General Scott, is leading our armies. What may be, or may not be, the result of this war, none can foresee; for none, in times like these, can predict to-day the events of to-morrow. None need to; least of all, the Abolitionists. Through all the intermediate stages of this war, through all the defeats and victories-little heeding what may be its aspect to-day or next week-the Abolitionist sees the one great aim and end, the one great victory of the war. There is but one victory to be obtained, and all things else will be defeat. That victory is the abolition of slavery-the wiping out of the cause of the war. To that end we see all things tending; to that victory we see God leading the armies of the nation. To that He has been leading his own hosts through this long struggle of righteousness against oppression. Who have fought out this battle? They who, through evil report and good report, have kept well their pledges of fidelity to the slave; have sought ever that one end. They told the nation what God required of it, and the alternative which he gave it. Not on them rests, to-day, the blood of those who fall in battle; for the nation chose not to take the alternative of peaceful abolition, and there was no help for the reverse. Therefore, this day, the anniversary of British emancipation-rather mournful to us, because we remember that there are no sadder words than "might have been "-is yet a day of great joy to us. We rejoice, because the deliverance of the slave is at hand. And we are not to be discouraged by any of those considerations which arc so frequently urged upon us, that those who are carrying out God's will, unknowingly, do not sympathize with us; for God uses all instruments to do his work. But why should we be either surprised or discouraged, when we see exactly the state of things which for years we have been predicting? Here we stand to-day exactly where, some twenty five years ago, our earliest Abolitionists said the nation would stand if she continued her warfare against God; and now the timid Abolitionist is half afraid to trust events to work themselves out; is half afraid that, after all, God will not keep his promises to man. We all know that it is through terrible storm and conflict-it may be through oceans of blood-that we as well as our nation are to pass, in order to attain this victory. But what then? Is any thing worse than continued slavery? Are all the horrors of war which you can conceive, worse than the horrors of that continued war in which all the victories are on one side and all the defeats and suffering on the other? That is the war which has been going on for the last thirty years, and which we have been trying to bring to a peaceful end; and though we did not succeed in that, are we not to thank God and take courage that it is about to be brought to an end in another way?
We rejoice, then, to-day, as the slave's representatives, standing here and seeing in the distance the day of his deliverance drawing nigh. We rejoice that God has proved Himself again, as He ever proves Himself, true to his own words of promise or of threatening. We rejoice for the sake of all those who have trusted in Him, that they have found Him true, and that they henceforward can trust, from their own long experience, as well as from the faith with which they began the war, that the weapons of his warfare are to be successful. And what then, my friends? Are we to take off our armor, fold our hands, and sit down, feeling that the victory is already won? Not quite yet, because four millions of slaves still wear their chains; and we must not yet cease our work. The party which has brought the nation up to the point on which it stands to-day, will surely not cease from their efforts, and allow the nation to slip backward from the height which it has attained; for you know that it is only by the continued efforts of the Abolitionists that any party in the nation has made any advance towards freedom, and it is only by their supporting strength that any party, in or out of the government, now stands upright, demanding the triumph of freedom. Not now, just on the verge of victory, shall we let go our weapons. Not now, when all might be lost by their unfaithfulness, shall they fail, who for long years have endured persecution, the sneers of the world, the threatening?, and the fulfilled threatenings, of many a mob, who have stood against all the opposition
<c03>
of this nation-not now,-when the nation is at last ready to join in our cry, shall we step down from our platform, or let go our grasp on the sword of the Spirit, by which, with God's help, we have won our victories. It shall never be said that the American Anti-Slavery Society has failed in its duty in the last hour-that its standard-bearer has fainted. No, my friends, we must keep that standard floating yet a little while longer, let it cost what it may;-a little while longer, till it shall wave in the breeze that bears to us the slave's jubilee song. Then, then we may furl it, as we cry-"Not unto us, O Lord, but unto Thee, now be the glory! "while the multitude take up the shout with which we commenced our warfare, and cry-" Hallelujah! for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!" (Loud and prolonged applause.)
E. H. HEYWOOD was then introduced, who spoke very briefly, (the hour of adjournment being close at hand,) but to great acceptance; and at the close of his remarks, the audience were dismissed by Rev. S. J. MAY, with these parting words-" My heart's desire and prayer to God for us all is, that we may be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; inasmuch as we know that our labor will not be in vain in the Lord."

ESSEX CO. ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY.
A quarterly meeting of the Essex County A. S. Society was held in Lyceum Hall, Salem, on Sunday, August 4th.
The meeting was called to order by the President, (C. L. Remond,) of Salem, and, in the absence of the Secretary, Joseph Merrill, of Danvers, was chosen Secretary, pro tem.
The meeting was addressed by the President in his usual eloquent manner, by James N. Buffum, in his matter-of-fact arguments, and by A. T. Foss and Parker Pillsbury with their iron-linked logic, driving every nail to the head, and clenching it as they went.
On motion, it was voted, that Eli F. Burnham, Maria S. Page, C. L. Remond, and Martha Bassett be a Committee on Finance.
On motion of Josiah Hay ward, it voted, that when we do adjourn, we adjourn to meet at half-past 2 o'clock,
Voted to adjourn.
Met agreeably to adjournment, J. N. Buffum, first Vice President, in the chair.
The following resolutions were presented by Parker Pillsbury, and accepted, and the meeting was addressed by Parker Pillsbury, John T. Page, John A. Innis, C. L. Remond, and J. N. Buffum:-
1. Resolved, That the work of the true abolitionists is not done or materially affected by any charge whatever in the government, so long as it recognizes slavery as an Institution to be protected and prolonged, instead of execrated and exterminated.
2. Resolved, That slavery is a National and Northern, as well as Southern crime, and the North cannot wash away its participation in it, in the blood of its Southern accomplices; however constitutional it may be to compel the seceded States buck to their allegiance, and to restore the public property, so treasonably as well as feloniously seized by them.
3. Resolved, That slavery and the agitation of the abolitionists for its overthrow, are indeed the only cause's of the present fearful hostility between the North and the South-illustrating and proving the " IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT " doctrine, once so boldly enunciated, both by Secretary Seward and President Lincoln, and fulfilling the prophecy of the anti-slavery movement for thirty years, that slavery and slaveholders would rule the nation while it was possible, and ruin, when they could no longer rule.
4. Resolved, That slavery being the grand cause of our present national calamity, a true statesmanship, a high patriotism, an enlightened philosophy, a genuine religious faith, "and a decent regard for the opinions of mankind," would dictate its immediate and entire overthrow.
5. Resolved, That the necessity for such a measure is not only becoming more and more apparent every hour for the successful prosecution of the present conflict, but is obviously the demand of a vast majority of the reflecting people of the North.
On motion of C. L. Remond, it was voted to adjourn to half-past 6 o'clock, P. M.
EVENING SESSION. The meeting was called to order by J. N. Buffum, and addressed by J. N. Buffum, A. T. Foss, Parker Pillsbury, and C. L. Remond.
Voted, That we adjourn to meet at such place as the Executive Commute may appoint, three months from this day.
The meetings, though small in numbers, were of universal interest. Members came from various parts of the country to help forward the " good time coming"; sure to come, in spite of the wiles of pro-slavery priests, and corrupt, lying, compromising politicians.
The general feeling of the people is, that we ought to hold more of these meetings, to give tone to the public sentiment in this our day of trial. This meeting was more successful than some of us expected, even financially not a failure, as the Agent's report will show.
JOSEPH MERRILL, Sec'y pro tem.
To CORRESPONDENTS. A letter from W. C. (Gosport, N. Y.) has been received; but the previous letter of which he speaks, containing money, has not come to hand. Thanks for his account of the celebration of Aug. 1st, at Drummondville; we have an account of the same meeting in the Toronto Globe, but have no room for either this week.
The "Fraternity" propose to observe the forthcoming anniversary of the birthday of the late Theodore Parker by suitable exercises at Allston Hall, on Friday evening, the 23d inst. Brief addresses will be made by several of Mr. Parker's friends, interspersed with music, and the occasion will doubtless be one of much interest.
Free tickets of admission may be had at the Anti-Slavery Office.
FIT ASSOCIATES. In a list, given by the Journal of Commerce, of what it calls "Peace Newspapers" in the Northern Free States, the only ones ranked under that la-ad in this city, and further designated as "opposed to the present war," are the Boston Courier and the Boston Herald.
NATIONAL EAST. A proclamation for a East, to be observed by the people of the United States of America on the last Thursday in September, has been signed by President Lincoln. It recommends prayer and humiliation, but says not a word of reformation. It proposes fasting, but passes by in silence the "one thing needful" in our present exigency-the abolition of slavery.
THE WHOLE STORY TOLD. The London Spectator has this paragraph under its heading of "News of the Week ":-
"The American Congress has voted the men and money required by the President, and twenty per cent, more, and the House of Representatives has affirmed, by 92 to 55, that it is' no part of the duty of officers to capture fugitive slaves.' The hand moves slowly on the dial, but it moves, and when the ringer passes the hour, the knell of slavery will ring out with a clang which will startle Europe."
ARREST OF MR. FAULKNER. Ex-Minister Faulkner has been arrested in Washington, just in time to prevent his intended departure. Letters received by recent steamers show him giving aid and comfort to rebel agents abroad, as he has done to their allies here. Some of his correspondence with Richmond has been intercepted. A cavalry regiment in Winchester, Va., was waiting his coming as its colonel.
A letter from Minister Fogg states that Garibaldi said to him-" If your war is for freedom, I am with you with 20,000 men." So says the Tribune. What answer shall Minister Fogg make to Garibaldi?

GEN. BUTLER'S CONTRABAND OF WAR,
PART III.
By what authority do the officers of the United States army assume to send back fugitive slaves, and to compel, under the fearful penalty of disobedience of orders, the brave and high-minded men under their command to become slave-catchers and the keepers of the slave-pens, to which they every now and then convert their camps at the bidding of some fragment of the old slave-oligarchy?
The Fugitive Slave Act has ceased to exist for traitors and rebels. They have renounced the Constitution and the laws, are levying war against them, and against the nation which ordained, and its government which administers them. Protection and allegiance are correlative. The denial of one cancels the obligation of the other.
But if the Fugitive Slave Act were still in full force, it would not apply to a fugitive slave within the same State where he made escape, nor within the District of Columbia. "Persons held to service or labor in one State, escaping into another," is the language of the Constitution. Those are the only persons who come within the scope of the Act, except, of course, all men and women of the Free States, of whom it makes slave-hounds and sluts.
It is a principle of all municipal laws that any party may refuse and renounce a law passed for their special behalf. The South has renounced and disavowed the fugitive enactment with all the rest, and only asks that which is the first desire and greatest need of all criminals, "to be let alone."
To cap the climax of absurdity and iniquity, there is in our camps, forts and ships of war, no tribunal, as provided by the Act, to try a man for his liberty; no proofs prescribed by it are adduced; in a word, none of its forms for the arrest, detention, trial or surrender of the person claimed, is, or can be, in those places, observed; nor does any authority, created by this act, grant a certificate for " his taking off."
It is by the war power, and by that alone, that these discreditable, rather, these devilish, deeds have been done.
For half a century, upon the plea that our hands were tied by the Constitution of our fathers, we have warmly repelled the reproaches, heaped upon us by the world, for shouting liberty with our lips, while cherishing slavery in our bosom; yet no sooner are our hands freed from the bonds of the slaveholders, and this by their own malignant and murderous assaults upon the nation, than we apply ourselves with new vigor and a more devoted subserviency to do their dirty and fiendish work!
"What trick, what starting-hole shall we now find
To hide us from this open and apparent shame."
The foundation of the summary and terrible code of arms, is the unavoidable necessity and duty of prosecuting a just war with success, of executing justice upon wicked and bloody tyrants and aggressors; extinguishing the cause or causes, which enkindle their hostility, and procuring the speediest return of peace, compatible with the accomplishment of these objects. The return to enemies and traitors of their fugitive slaves is an impious and fatal antagonism to every one of these objects of the war, and consequently in self-evident violation of its laws. It is using the war power to protract and aggravate the horrors of war. It is to spare its guilty authors, multiply its innocent victims, and confirm and perpetuate its cause. It is an inexplicable crime against the poor and oppressed, and an immeasurable wrong and injury to the people, who have, under God, the highest moral and legal title to the services of the sympathizing and well-affected of the whole nation. He who inhumanly and in violation of law rejects the offer of devoted service to the republic, so long as she stands in need, and thrusts the devoter back to wicked torments and into the ranks and trenches of the traitors, whence he may never escape more, commits manifold moral treason, to say the very least of it. If he be a military officer) acting under orders, ho should disobey them; for by the Rules and Articles established by Congress for the government of the army, no officer or soldier is bound to obey an unlawful order. If he act on his own responsibility, and with a design of "giving intelligence" and "aid" to the enemies of the United States, he ought to suffer death. If he err from mere force of habit and tradition, like the Scythian slaves, who after beating their masters in a succession of combats with the sword, submitted trembling and terror-stricken, when their masters flung down the sword and drew their whips, he should be erased from the army rolls, as one crippled for life. If he be a cabinet or other high civil officer, directing or counselling the rendition of a slave by the military arm, he should be removed by the President, or impeached and cast out by Congress. A few stem and vigorous examples would teach our foes and friends too, together with the whole nest of most pernicious spies, prostitutes, and traitors in the metropolis) that it is not a cheap and trivial affair to attempt the; life of a nation, and the life of liberty.
There is no principle or rule of war which authorizes us to treat slaves, flying to us from traitors and rebels, in any other manner than we would deserters and refugees from their armies and hangmen, their lynch law and prison-houses.
I might rest this point on natural right, on the power of civilized and Christian warriors to unmake slaves, whom heathen and barbarous wars originally made; and, above all, upon the total absence of any adverse principle or authority. But I will not do so. English and American history furnish positive and practical proofs of the position.
Two days after the preliminary treaty of independence and peace between the United States and Great Britain had been agreed to by Franklin, John Adams, and Jay, on the part of the United States, Henry Laurens of South Carolina, appointed with them to conduct the negotiation, arrived at Paris, and insisted upon the insertion of an additional article, stipulating that " no slaves or other property " should be carried off by the British army at the evacuation of the posts in their occupation. The demand was admitted by the British Commissioners, and the treaty, so modified, signed November 30, 1782.
A large number of slaves, who had taken refuge with the enemy's forces, or been captured by them, and not yet removed, were claimed by Washington under the above-mentioned article. But Sir Guy Carleton, Commander-in-chief of the evacuating army, rejected the claim, maintaining that his prisoners and proteges were not embraced in the stipulation. He undoubtedly regarded them as freemen and British subjects from the moment of their capture or reception, and so not touched by the treaty; and he took good care to secure their safety by sending them away in the first embarkation some months prior to evacuation day. Honor to the memory of the brave and faithful veteran! He consented to leave a list of these persons, to the end that those claiming to be their owners might try their luck, in an application to his government, for compensation. Of course they failed not to make fierce reclamations. The question remained unsettled till 1794, when, by Jay's treaty, the claim was formally relinquished. This was one great cause of the Southern rage against the treaty and the negotiator. He was called by the Richmond Inquirer, "that damned infernal villain, John Jay."
[To be continued.]
CONCORD, N. H., August 8. The office of the Democratic Standard was completely rifled of its contents this afternoon by a mob composed of soldiers of the returned 1st regiment, and citizens. The Standard, which has been a long time "secesh," published an article reflecting on the soldiers. They demanded a retraction, and the Palmers, editors and proprietors, shook pistols and axes out of the windows and dared the mob, while the city authorities endeavored to quell the disturbance. The Palmers fired four shots, wounding two soldiers. The office was immediately gutted, and the materials burned in the street. The Palmers took refuge in the attic, but were finally found and carried to the police station under protection of the police, though with great difficulty.

THE "CONTRABAND" QUESTION.
INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE SECRETARY OF WAR.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 11. The following letter has just been dispatched to Gen. Butler, by the Secretary of War:-
WASHINGTON, Aug.-, 1861.
GENERAL:-The important question of the proper disposition to be made of fugitives from service in the States in insurrection against the Federal Government, to which you have again directed my attention in your letter of July 20, has received my most attentive consideration. It is the desire of the President that all existing rights in all the States be fully respected and maintained. 
The war now prosecuted on the part of the Federal Government is a war for the Union, for the preservation of all the Constitutional rights of the States and the citizens of the States in the Union, hence no question can arise as to fugitives from service within the States and territories in which the authority of the Union is fully acknowledged. The ordinary forms of judicial proceedings must be respected by the military and civil authorities alike, for the enforcement of legal forms.
But in the States wholly or in part under insurrectionary control, where the laws of the United States are so far opposed and resisted that they cannot be effectually enforced, it is obvious that the rights dependent upon the execution of these laws must temporarily fail, and it is equally obvious that the rights dependent on the laws of the State within which military operations are conducted, must necessarily be subordinate to the military exigencies created by the insurrection, if not wholly forfeited by the treasonable conduct of the parties claiming them. To this the general rule of the right to service forms an exception. The act of Congress, approved Aug. 6th, 1861, declares that if persons held to service shall be employed in hostility to the United States, the right to their services shall be discharged there from. It follows, of necessity, that no claim can be recognized by the military authority of the Union to the services of such persons when fugitives.
A more difficult question is presented in respect to persons escaping from the service of loyal masters. It is quite apparent that the laws of the State under which only the service of such fugitives can be claimed, must needs be wholly or almost wholly suspended, as to the remedies, by insurrection and the military measures necessitated by it; and it is equally apparent that the substitution of military for judicial measures for the enforcement of such claims must be attended by great inconvenience, embarrassments, and injuries.
Under these circumstances, it seems quite clear that the substantial rights of local masters are still best protected by receiving such fugitives, as well as fugitives from disloyal masters, into the service of the United States, and employing them under such organizations and in such occupations as circumstances may suggest or require. Of course a record should be kept, showing the names and description of the fugitives, the names and characters, as loyal or disloyal, of the masters, and such facts as may be necessary to a correct understanding of the circumstances of each case.
After tranquility shall have been restored upon the return of peace, Congress will doubtless properly provide for all the persons thus received into the service of the Union, and for a just compensation to loyal masters. In this way only, it would seem, can the duty and safety of the Government and just rights of all be fully reconciled and harmonized. You will therefore consider yourself instructed to govern your future action in respect to fugitives from service by the premises herein stated, and will report from time to time, and at least twice in each month, your action in the premises to this Department.
You will, however, neither authorize nor permit any interference by the troops under your command with the servants of peaceable citizens in a house or field, nor will you in any manner encourage such citizens to leave the lawful service of their masters, nor will you, except in cases where the public good may seem to require it, prevent the voluntary return of any fugitive to the service from which he may have escaped.
I am, very respectfully,
Your obedient servant,
SIMON CAMERON,
Secretary of War.
To Major General Butler, Commanding Department of Virginia, Fortress Monroe.
ANOTHER BATTLE IN MISSOURI.-A band of one thousand rebels attacked a camp of Union men at Athens, Mo., on Monday morning, Aug. 5th. at five o'clock. There was a considerable amount of arms and ammunition stored in the camp, which comprised three hundred and fifty men under Capt. Moore. Fighting lasted about one hour, when the rebel thieves retreated.
Capt. Moore having been reinforced by 150 men from Centralia, Iowa, on the opposite side of the river, gave chase to the traitors for about a mile and a half, killing one, taking 18 prisoners, 30 horses, and two rebel flags. Several rebels were also wounded.
After the fight six or eight rebels were found dead on the field. In the afternoon a bearer of a rebel flag of truce was admitted, who stated that they carried off fourteen killed, and as many more wounded and missing. The rebels were led by a brother of Ex-Senator Green. Three Unionists were killed and eight wounded.
Athens is a small town in the extreme northwest of Missouri, on the Desmoines river, about thirty miles from Keokuk. It is reported that the Union forces have been reinforced by 500 or 600 men from Iowa, and marched Sunday night in pursuit. The rebels were encamped eight miles from Athens, and another fight or foot-race has taken place ere this.

YET ANOTHER BATTLE.
ST. Louis, Aug. 13. The following is an official report of a fight near Springfield, on Saturday of last week, by one of Gen. Lyon's aids:-
" To MAJOR GENERAL FREMONT:-General Lyon in three columns, under himself, General Siegel, and Major Sturgis, attacked the enemy at 6 1-2 o'clock on the morning of the 10th, nine miles southeast of Springfield. The engagement was severe. Our loss is about eight hundred in killed and wounded. Gen. Lyon was killed in a charge at the head of his column. Our force was 8000 including 2000 Home Guards. The muster rolls taken from the enemy give his force at 23,000, including regiments from Louisiana d Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas Rangers, and Cherokee halt" breeds. Their loss is reported heavy, including Generals McCulloch and Price. This statement is corroborated by prisoners. Their tents and wagons were destroyed in the action.
General Siegel left only one gun on the field. He retreated to Springfield with a large number of prisoners. At 3 o'clock on the morning of the 11th, he continued his retreat on Rolla, bringing off his baggage trains and $25,000 in specie from the Springfield Banks.
The following is the verbatim report of the special messenger to Gen. Fremont:-
Early on Saturday morning Gen. Lyon marched out of Springfield. He came up with the enemy on Davis Creek, on Green's Prairie, four miles southwest of Springfield, where they had taken a strong position. Gen. Lyon fired the first gun at 20 minutes past 6, when the battle immediately commenced. A severe cannonading was kept up two or three hours, when the tire of Totten's artillery becoming too severe for the enemy, they gradually fell back towards their encampment on Wilson's Creek. Gen. Lyon's cavalry on the left flank, and Gen. Siegel's artillery on the right, then began a terrific attack, and spread slaughter and dismay in the ranks of the rebels, pursuing them to their camps. The shells from Totten's artillery set fire to their tents and baggage wagons, which were all destroyed.
A Louisiana and a Mississippi Regiment seemed to suffer the most, and were almost annihilated. Sometime in the afternoon, while Gen. Lyon was leading his column, his horse was shot under him. Immediately he mounted another, and as he turned around to his men, waving his hat and cheering his men on to victory, he was struck in the small of his back and fell dead to the ground. The command then devolved on Gen. Siegel.
The pursuit was continued until nightfall, when our little army rested for the night in the enemy's encampment. On Sunday morning, Gen. Siegel, fearing the enemy might recover and attempt to' cut his command off from Springfield, fell back on that city, where the Home Guards were stationed. Then fearing the great numbers of the enemy might induce them to get between him and Rolla, Gen. Siegel concluded to fall back on Rolla with his provision train and meet reinforcements.
At the time of the departure of the messenger, the enemy had not been seen, and it is probable that Gen. Siegel was not disturbed on his inarch. Ninety rebels were captured, including a Colonel of distinction, the messenger not remembering his name. The sword and horse of General McCulloch were among the trophies.
Reinforcements are on their way to Rolla, and Gen. Siegel and his army may be considered safe.
From St. Domingo we have advices to the 25th ult., stating that the war between Hayti and Spain is at an end, the difficulties between the two countries being amicably adjusted. The Spanish authorities declare slavery forever abolished in the Island, and threaten with severe penalties any person endeavoring to reinstate the system.-Tribune, l2th inst.
PARSON BROWNLOW'S PAPER SUPPRESSED BY THE REBELS. A passenger from Richmond via Knoxville, Friday, reports that Gen. Zollicoffer, at the head of the Tennessee troops there, suppressed Parson Brown-low's Knoxville Whig.
<c06>
THE UNION TRIUMPH IN KENTUCKY. The Louisville papers bring, accounts of the Union triumph at the recent election in Kentucky. In the city of Louisville the Union candidate for the legislature was elected by a unanimous vote. The Journal comments upon the general result in the following jubilant style:
"Never did a party make greater and more determined efforts to carry art election than the secessionists of Louisville made to carry this. They resorted to all possible expedients for inflaming and exasperating the public mind. They endeavored to incite our people even to the pitch of forcible resistance to the laws. They invented all sorts of false issues, and pressed them with their whole power and ingenuity. Their candidates thought to disguise then real position, and presented false issues in the hope of deceiving at least a portion of the community. They resorted to appeals, to threats, to promises, to protestations. Their organ put forth all its powers of persuasion, appealing alike to all the best and all the worst passions of human nature. All of them seemed to realize that their last hope was staked upon the conflict. And now look at the vote. Never, never was a party more utterly annihilated.
Of course our returns for the rest of Kentucky are very limited, but we have no doubt that the friends of the Union, the opponents of secession, have achieved an overwhelming victory throughout the State. If this is a fact, if a large majority of the men elected yesterday to the next legislature are Union men, it would seem to be lime for the bitter conflict in Kentucky to close. If the people, by a resounding majority, have still again pronounced their verdict in favor of the Union, the secessionists cannot longer attempt to keep up this unhappy and disastrous agitation and turmoil without willingly acting the part of mischievous and pestilent citizens."
BANGOR, Me., August 12. At 1 o'clock to day the Bangor Democrat, a secession sheet, was completely cleared out by a large number of people. During an alarm of fire, a crowd of people entered the office, cleared it out, and burnt the contents in the street. Mr. Emery, the editor, escaped unharmed. One Jones, a barber, who made some demonstration, was also badly used, but was rescued and put in jail.
The Richmond Examiner, of the 8th, says the rebel Congress, Tuesday, considered the bill for public defence. The bill authorizes the President to employ the military conformably to the act of March 16, and to accept 400,000 volunteers.
GARIBALDI APPOINTED A MAJOR GENERAL.-The intimations which have been flying through the leading journals for two weeks past, to the effect that Garibaldi had tendered his services to the Federal Government, at last prove correct. His offers have been accepted, and he has been tendered an appointment as major general in the American volunteer army.-Journal of Commerce.

ST. MARY'S LAKE
WATER-CURE.
OPENED BY
H. A. PETERMAN, M. D.
THE Proprietors of this Institution take pleasure in announcing to the invalids of Michigan and its neighboring States, that they have opened their WATER-CURE at St. Mary's Lake, and are now in readiness to receive patients.
This Institution is situated in one of the most healthy and pleasant locations in the State, on the banks of a beautiful little lake, four miles North of the City of Battle Creek.
The buildings are new, commodious, and furnished for the comfort and convenience of invalids. The bath-rooms are large, and fitted up with hot, cold, vapor, chemical, and electrical baths.
The lake, whose waters are as clear and soft as those of a spring from the granite mountain's base, is well supplied with boats and bath-houses. No more beautiful fresh, water bathing can be found in any land.
Several hundred acres of the grand Old Oak Forest, immediately surrounding the lake, have been reserved for pleasure-grounds.
The afflicted, requiring surgical treatment, will find this a most desirable establishment, where they can be placed in the best possible condition to bear an operation, and receive the best of care afterwards.
Particular attention given to the treatment of diseases of the Eye. All operations performed that warrant a prospect of restoring sight to the blind. Our treatment for Cataract is entirely now, and in advance of anything hitherto known.
A supply of beautiful Artificial Eyes kept constantly on hand.
Paralysis, and every variety of Nervous and Chronic diseases, will be treated.
The Ladies' Department is under the care of Mrs. S. A. Peterman, whose long experience in the treatment of the diseases incident to the female constitution renders her treatment unsurpassed by that of any physician now practising in that department of the medical profession.
There will be a competent Music Teacher in attendance, to give instruction in Piano, Guitar, and Vocal Music, to such as may wish to take medical treatment and pursue the study of Music at the same time. For such, this will be found a most desirable location, where the mental and physical systems may both be developed; the one in the music room, the other in rambling through the leafy woods, in the Gymnasium, and in boat-rowing, than which no better exercise can be found.
We intend, with the aid of competent help in every department, to make this CURE the invalid's HOME, as well as a place for medical treatment.
Those coming as patients should furnish themselves with two comfortables, two linen or cotton packing sheets, one woollen blanket, and one half-dozen bath towels, or they can be furnished by the CURE at fifty cents per week extra.
TERMS-From $7 to $10 per week, for treatment, board, &c., according to roomand care.

Poetry.
For the Liberator.
WAITING.
She is waiting,-wearily waiting,
With eyelids heavy and dim;
Waiting-to hear from the battle,
Waiting-for tidings of him.
Trembling, the list she has studied
Of the lost on that terrible day,
But the paper his name containing,
Has been bid from her sight away.
She does? not know 'mong the missing"
That by others his name shall be read,
For they cannot bear to tell her
Till they know is he living or dead.
And so each day she is waiting
From early worn till night,
For the letter that never cometh
To bless her longing sight.
And he,-ah! he too is waiting,
Though where we cannot tell;
There was danger all around him,
It may be that he fell.
Perhaps he was one of the many
Brave soldiers, young and fair,
Who passed to the spirit-home that day;
Perhaps he is waiting there.
Or it may be-ah! we cannot tell,
It were a sadder fate,
Suffering, sick and wounded,
Mong strangers he may wait.
Perhaps he is a prisoner,
Ah! weary lot indeed,
Waiting-helplessly waiting,
Yet knowing our country's need.
Oh! the Summer flowers are blooming,
And the birds sing blithely and gay,
But a cloud is over our sunshine,
For how many are waiting to-day!

From the N. Y. Evening Post.
The Battle of Sunday. July 21st.
BY ALICE B. HAVEN.
We-walking so slowly adown the green lane,
With Sabbath-bells chiming, and birds singing psalms,
He-eager with haste, pressing on o'er the slain,
Mid the trampling of steeds and the drum-beat to arms;
In that cool dewy morning.
We-waiting with faces all reverent and still,
The organ's voice vibrant with praise unto God-
His face set like flint with the impress of will,
To press back the foe, or to die on the sod-
My fair, brave young brother!
We-kneeling to hear benedictions of love,
Our hearts all at peace with the message from Heaven!
He-stretched on the field, gasping, wounded, to prove
If mercy were found where such courage had striven,
In the midst of the slaughter.
Oh, God!-can I live with the horrible truth!
Stubbed through as he lay, with their glittering steel,
Could they look in that face, 
like a woman's for youth,
And crush out its beauty with musket and heel,
Like bounds, or like demons!
That brow I have blessed in my dead mother's place,
Each morning and evening since the went unto rest;
Smoothing down the fair cheek, as my own baby's face,
Those eyes with her look, where my kisses were pressed,
For I saw hers-so tender!
Curses spring to my lips!
Oh, ray God, send the hail
Of swift, ready vengeance for deeds such as this!
Forego all thy mercy, if judgment must fail!
Forgive my wild heart if it prayeth amiss-
His blood crieth upward!
Amiss!-and the strife of my clamorous grief
Is hushed into stillness; what grief like to thine!
If my poor human heart, with its passions so brief,
IS tortured with pangs, can we guess the Divine,
With depths past all searching!
know eyes more tender looked upward to Thee,
That visage so marred by the torturing crown-
Those smooth noble limbs racked with anguish I see;
The side where the blood and the water gushed down
From stroke fierce and brutal.
Help His white with anguish to take up His prayer;
Help hearts that are bursting to stifle their cries;
The shout of the populace, too, has been there,
To drown pleas of justice, to clothe truth in lies-
To enrage and to madden.
They knew not we loved them; they knew not we prayed
For their weal as our own, We are brethren," we
plead-
Unceasing those prayers to Our Father were made,
When they flung down the palm for palmetto we said,
"Let us still hope to win them."
"God so loved that he gave!
We are giving to these
The lives that were dearer to us than our own-
Let us add prayer for blood,
trusting God to appease 
Our heart's craving pain,
when He hears on his throne,
Oh, Father, forgive them!

"All Soft and Brown the upturned Fields."
BY. C.S. ROGERS.
All soft and brown the upturned fields
Lie mellow in the sun; 
The very skies yield auguries
Of better days begun;
A warmth, a fulness brooding there,
Which nothing else could bring.
A sense of blessing in the air,
The promise of the spring!
And shall the days of cloud and cold
In truth no more be seen?
The snowdrop through the loosened mould
Sends up its spikes of green,
Fresh gold upon the willow falls,
Soft lights the uplands steep,
A strange, sweet change, whose coming calls
Such loveliness from sleep!
And I am glad as any bird,
It is a joy to be,-
There is no sound of life fresh-stirred
But brings delight to me.
The flow of brooks, the cock's clear call,
From distant hamlets borne,-
My pulse beats happy time with all
These voices of the morn.
Oh! Nature! thou my first, best friend!
My earliest love, and best!
With us was never any end
Of confidence and rest: 
Here, no reserve, but frankest speech,
No need for place apart-
I do not fear to let thee hear
The beating of my heart!

THE FATHERLAND.
FROM THE GERMAN OF CLAUS HARMS. 
BY REV. C. T. BROOKS.
Know ye the land? Oh! not on earth it lies-
For which the heart in hours of trouble sighs;
Where flows no tear, no sorrow mars the song,
The good are happy, and the weak are strong.
Know ye the land?
The goal, the goal, 
O friends, is there!
Press on with heart and soul.
Know ye the way-the rough and thorny road?
The wanderer groans beneath his painful load;
He faints-he sinks; in dust he lifts his eyes.
"How long,O0 Lord? the weary pilgrim sighs.
Know ye the way?
It tends, it tends 
To that blest land where every torment ends.
Fnow ye the Friend-a man-a child of earth,
Yet more, far more than all of human birth?
That rough and thorny road his feet have trod;
Well can he guide poor pilgrims home to God.
Know ye the Friend?
His hand, his hand
Conducts us safely to our native land.

The Liberator.
The Highway of American Civilization.
A DISCOURSE, Prcached at Music Hall, Boston, July 14th, 1861.
BY REV. A. D. MAYO, OF ALBANY, N.Y.
LUKE 3: 4, 5, 6.-Prepare ye the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth; and all flesh shall sec the salvation of God.
In oriental lands, when the great king vent abroad to bless any region with the light of his countenance, he sent before him heralds to declare his coming, and hosts of men to prepare a road fit for the journeying of the royal retinue. When John the Baptist came preaching repentance and remission of sins in the wilderness of Judea, he declared that his fierce and searching gospel was but the building of a highway over which one mightier than he should march to a peaceful conquest of the earth. Men were to be frightened into repentance, subdued to obedience, the axe to be laid at the root of the tree," the chaff to be burned in unquenchable flame," that the loftier Spirit might appear, baptizing with the Holy Ghost and with fire, regenerating the worst and restoring the vilest to the bosom of the Almighty Love.
So has the great cause of American Christian Civilization sent its John the Baptist down into the wilderness to preach-" Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Our Prophet is a patriotic army of 300,000 men, marching into the abodes of disorder, despotism and revolt, to announce the coming of a power whose shoe-latchet it is unworthy to unloose; even the sublime presence of a higher Religion and Society than has ever prevailed in these regions of the earth. Present events in our country have this significance:-That a great movement for the general advancement of Humanity has slowly grown and finally dominated in twenty of the United States; that in its approach to the border of an adverse semi-civilization, it has found itself confronted by the common obstacles of barbarism; that it has sent forth its armed herald to proclaim repentance, and build the, road towards the Gulf of Mexico and the, Southern pole; that when that way is built, a Christian order of Society will march over it, peacefully regenerating every hostile institution, restoring man to his rights, and exalting a Confederacy of half-civilized States to the companionship of a pure religion and a well-ordered government, through gradual and peaceful change.
To-day, assembled in the church of one who, as much as any man of our generation, was responsible for what we now see, let us contemplate the religious significance of the present condition of American affairs. If we can look with eyes that penetrate the mist of popular excitement and delusion, we shall understand that this conflict in which the country is now engaged is a religious contest. Its cause is the irresistible march of a higher religious life from the Northern towards the Southern States of the republic; in its way unearthing and driving to desperation all the powers of a decaying Religion and Society; and forcing them into armed revolt by the very presence of its exalted purposes: as wilful evil is always first driven to wanton madness by the appearance of saving love. As it may be carried on under the direction of a humane and energetic administration of the U. S. government, the war should become the agency of those higher ideas and institutions that must finally prevail over the whole land. If thus conducted and pressed to its true ending, its results are to be the opening of a vast area of territory, containing a population of millions of our countrymen, to the influx of the highest modern life.
1st. Behold how this mighty conflict has been caused by the irresistible growth of the North into a higher form of religious faith, carrying along with it all social, national and political ideas and organizations! It is false to say that the Northern States have degenerated spiritually, as they have advanced in material prosperity. On the contrary, they have moved faster along the path towards an exalted religious faith, during the past quarter of a century, than was ever known of any great people in history. The source of their best achievements has been the enlightenment and expansion of their Religion in the direction of an inspired Humanitarianism. The Religions of the past have chiefly been the absorption of man in God, and his consequent degradation as a being of this world. Christianity was originally the annunciation of God in man; and the people of the Northern States of this republic have more clearly apprehended that essential feature of Christianity than the whole church of the past eighteen centuries.
Religion, in these States, during the period named, has flowed with a steady current towards the recognition of the Divine in Human Nature, and the consecration of human affairs. The Deity has chiefly been worshipped on the side of his Infinity that is turned towards man, and best known as the Father, the omnipresent familiar Love. Jesus has been chiefly esteemed for his glorious Manhood, even in the churches that proclaim him God Almighty. The Scriptures have been drawn forth from the artificial sanctity of cabalistic and priestly documents, and studied as the summit of human religious literature; and the characters and events therein described adjusted to their place in the history of mankind. Man has been regarded more in the light of his divine capacities and magnificent latent powers, than for what he actually is. The rights of man to all the freedom essential to develop that nature into divine proportions, have been every year more loudly asserted; and, as a consequence, all unholy institutions, inhuman relations and degrading social habits have more and more come under the condemnation of Religion; while Philanthropy has been the watchword of the most energetic popular movements of the day.
Living, as the present generation of Northern people has, in the very thick of this great onward impulse, being themselves in the marching ranks of the great army of advance, they have hardly comprehended the impetus with which their order of society has gone on, and the depth to which the popular ideas have penetrated. Like a deep and swiftly-flowing river, it has sped along, bearing conservative and radical towards a point far ahead of the suspicion of either. Our Northern controversies between Orthodox and Liberal, Democrat and Republican, have been like the disputes of passengers in a fast-sailing boat. The hunker could be at the wheel, and the radical stir up the coals in the furnace, but both were in a ship headed the same way, both equally interested that it should be kept afloat. Of course, the velocity of the progress could only be indicated by some great obstacle. In the North, there has been no obstacle large enough to materially impede the current. If, in some districts, it has appeared to be clogged, so that, to the eye of the impatient voyager, it hardly appeared to move, in others it has glided on like a silent fate speeding to its destiny. One obstacle alone has been strong enough to check, temporarily, this tremendous sweep of the higher American life. The slave society of fifteen Suites gathering about it all the venerable associations of an obsolete theology, a decaying social aristocracy, and the monarchical principle in politics, has, during our remembrance, frowned across the channel of this freshet like a great mud island mountain, heaped with the refuse of centuries. Against that island have the grand waves of our civilization dashed with a maddening agitation, repressed only to gather in greater volumes, and come pouring on in a more terrific force.
We could learn the tendencies of Northern civilization only by the outcry that came up against it from the land of oppression. One gathering shriek has come ringing from that quarter of the earth against us, as an infidel, anarchical, aggressive state of society. The far-seeing men of the South have made no vital distinction between our classes, parties and sects, for they have seen, what we did not, that we
<c03>
were all headed one way. Our religion was driving towards the exaltation of Human Nature, and would inevitably carry every thing along with it, and fiercely precipitate Northern society in a war against their barbarism. Their efforts to resist this onward movement have always been regarded as temporary by themselves, and for the last thirty years used as the prelude to a dissolution of the Union. They have gradually sought to estrange their people from ours, to confirm their tendencies of society which differed from ours. They have forced out their progressive class into the North, and kept away the radical emigration from Europe. Their theology has retreated more and more towards <illegible> absurdity, and their churches have parted from Northern fellowship as fast as could be. They have closed up their States against our literature, and stifled the expression of adverse opinions on all topics. Thus have they silently prepared the road of retreat to flee from us as soon as our first great political victory should come.
That battle was won last year. Whatever the politicians meant by it is of no consequence. God Almighty and his recreant servant Jefferson Davis both know that it announced the final triumph of an advanced Religious Civilization in the Republic. It meant that now the central power of the nation was peacefully to claim for the progressive ideas of the age the right of expression in all the States. It meant that the most enlightened and sensible advanced men of the South were to be set above the mob of despots that had so long kept them down; that free discussion in society was gradually to prevail; that light was to break in from all directions; that army, navy, post-office, judges, custom-houses, every agency of the U. S. government was hereafter to carry a lantern, with the words Modern Science inscribed upon it. If we aver no immediate purpose, indeed, no wish that the general government should attempt to abolish slavery, for them to open the South to the influence of modern ideas were a sentence of that barbarism to ultimate disintegration and death. The leaders of Southern affairs saw themselves beaten on the field of ideas; and, as such men always do, refused to submit, and appealed to the sword. The North responded like the breaking up of ice in her great rivers in the Spring, and is now flowing towards that devoted region,-an ocean of steady power, every sparkling drop an armed man.
We have no disposition to shirk the responsibility for this conflict before the nations of the earth, in the light of history. The North is responsible for this war just as Jesus was responsible for the crime of Judas and Pilate; just as Paul and the primitive church wore responsible for the martyrdoms inflicted by the emperor of Rome; just as Luther caused the Thirty Years' war; and our American ancestors the war of the Revolution; and every advance causes the resistance and tumult inaugurated by its enemies. Truth and pure religion are always irresistible, and must prevail. It the obstacle is not too strong, the triumph is peaceful; otherwise, the victory comes through blood. The leaders of society in the South refused to be regenerated, however peacefully, by the advancing power of the purest religion and the highest modern life. In their madness, they have charged us with tyranny, and arrayed their people against us as enemies. We accept their challenge. We, in behalf of God and Christ, and Humanity and Liberty, are the foes of all their evil, the friends of themselves and their posterity. Had they cooperated with us in building up a true Republic, there would have been no war. They grasped the sword to destroy the Republic, and must abide the issue of the conflict. They are in a great hurry to destroy us; we are able to take our time to save them. Thus has come about this civil war, as we hear it called. It means that a higher form of religion had carried the society of the North with it down to Mason and Dixon's line; and finding there a hundred thousand armed men opposing its passage, has gathered about it the tremendous agencies of our modern life, and prepared to cross the border and regenerate the country down to the Gulf, and out to the Pacific.
2d. From this point of view, we can discover the true relation of this war of Independence to the religious advancement of the country." On the side of the North, it is a part of a great movement towards a higher American faith, which shall include a purer civilization. We are not now waging war to exterminate any class of men, or to crush out any social order by the iron heel of military despotism. We have now no intention of subjugating the most unruly State to the condition of a conquered province. The mission of our arms is the same as our ideas, to develop a higher condition of society by the protection of the best elements of Republican government against their foes. There are more than ten righteous men in every seceding community who, if protected and permitted to inaugurate a better tendency of affairs can finally regenerate their Sodom. The most violent confederate State contains citizens enough who are not only loyal to the Union, but desire to make the Union a Christian Democracy. It is the vocation of the military power to suppress the despotism that now crushes these men into the dust; to vindicate for them the right to use all legitimate means of elevating their own communities. There are also hundreds of thousands of deluded people who suppose that, in fighting their national government, they are resisting the most odious tyranny. It is the purpose of our military organization to dispel this illusion, and show these misguided soldiers their grievous mistake. There is a political theory widely prevalent that palsies the loyalty of thousands of sincere and amiable men. We are to teach these speculators that there is a nationality on this continent that, in the name of God and humanity, as well as by legal right, claims their allegiance in behalf of mankind. There are also wicked and turbulent leaders to be defeated, disgraced, and disposed of in a way that will best further the great interests at stake in this contest.
Our army is therefore the rod in the hand of a paternal government, for correction and regeneration. Never was it, therefore, so important as now that the military should be held in strict subordination to the civil power. The splendid volunteer force of 300,000, that the coming autumn will behold, arrayed for the protection of our nationality, must be a machine in the hands of our government to develop a reliable patriotism. It is no crusaders' irresponsible host, swung by fierce impulse against a barbaric foe. It is not an aggregate of petty armies, marshalled by partisan leaders for demoralizing border warfare. It is indeed a fearful thing to behold an army of European dimensions enrolled on our peaceful soil, and we must all try to understand its legitimate use, or we shall find our remedy as hard to bear as our disease. The people must not forget the cause of this collision; the temporary interruption of a great social and religious reformation. They have called out this grand army to remove that obstruction, so that American civilization may go on in its course of peaceful reconstruction of society. That military power must be held tightly clenched in the hand of the civil authorities, guided by the most comprehensive and paternal policy towards offenders. The voice of our higher civilization, speaking through our vigorous and humane administration, has already cried out, To thy tents, 0 Israel"; and a mighty host has responded to the cry. The same power now commands us to restrain our impatience, while that assemblage of patriotic and intelligent citizens are taught the art of warfare. We must cease from our frantic cries for immediate and brilliant operations, and wait till our army can go forth, arrayed with all that modern science and skill can devise. Then, if the interests of our nationality demand a blow, let it fall like the bolt out of heaven, and crush whatever comes within its range. If comprehensive Christian statesmanship commands us to wait for months, and hang over the border like a threatening cloud, let us comply like one man. However eager our newly-made warriors may be to distinguish themselves and serve their country on bloody fields, they must remember they are the servants of the American people, speaking through their lawful government, and go enthusiastically to any service that power may dictate.
<c04>
As far as I am able to see, the administration has evidently prepared to make this use of our army: to employ it as an instrument for regenerating the South. Never did a government begin a contest against a rebellions district in a more Christian spirit It has had a noble auxiliary in our great Commander-in-Chief, whose successes have never left a stain on American annals. Already we have seen enough to divine the spirit of the war; and we can point triumphantly to our volunteer army, in contrast with the host arrayed against it. Never did two hostile camps more certainly symbolize the ideas they are set to enforce. The army of treason, in its march, forces every country back to the condition of barbarism. It sweeps the land clean of the great public works that are the glory of our free, industry. It burns the railroad bridge; blows up the dam; drains the canal; tears up the rails; cuts the wires of the telegraph, sets its privateers upon our commerce; plunders the farm; shuts up the manufactory and the mine, and impresses the mechanic; destroys the property of its enemy; repudiates all mercantile obligations and plunders its own people of their chief staples, under the transparent sophism of a cotton loan. It muzzles the press and tramples out free speech; closes the church and school, and forces master and pupil, priest and parish into the ranks. It is an army of destruction, a beast of ten horns and ten iron feet, butting, kicking, trampling and bellowing against everything that wears the form of modern civilization. Its weapons are broken oaths, perjured faith, official theft, grand and petit larceny. It has yet not advanced one step beyond the original Indian method of warfare. Whenever it can prevail by overpowering preponderance of numbers, or take advantage of the civilized forbearance of its foe, or skulk in ambuscade, it fights. Whenever challenged to open conflict, it flies or falls. Its generals keep up the spirit of the rank and file by the stupid lies that our President is a sot; our cities in rebellion; our soldiers insatiate and lustful beasts; our population a second edition of the Goths and Vandals. It is the same kind of host and works by the same methods that any wicked usurper or band of conspirators against humanity has gathered in past days to affront mankind.
We have an army that for intelligence, cool and rational comprehension of its cause, bravery and endurance, subordination and patriotic fervor, is unparalleled in the annals of the world. Behind it, protected by its ranks, flourish all the arts of peace. Society in the North has undergone no essential change by the detailment of 800,000 from its midst. Wherever it moves, carrying the banner of American hope and prophecy, disorder subsides, industry is restored, the railroad is rebuilt, the river spanned, the wire re-united, the press, free discussion, absolute safety to all the interests of life reappear. It is the army of restoration; not only replacing what has been destroyed by rebellion, but carrying new ideas into an adverse society. 300,000 pair of sharp eyes will now behold the nakedness that slavery and oppression have brought on a glorious country, and the lunacy to which it has reduced a noble people. 300,000 busy brains will ponder the mighty lesson; and, if we mistake not, this march is the prophecy of a future immigration even more significant than the exodus out of Europe to America. Our army is to be the first practical manifestation of Northern civilization to the masses in the South. I have no apprehension for its bravery, endurance, zeal. I have an abiding hope that the ideas of our greatest statesmen and commander-in-chief can prevail; and our army be a true representation to that distracted region, not only of our invincible power and fertility of resource, but of the virtues and spirit that propose to restore and not destroy.
I fear more than anything, especially in view of occasional defeat and outrage, that low ferocity, which, under the guise of patriotic ardor, is clamoring, through a portion of the press and upon the streets, for a war of extermination. The foremost journals of the country appear to me to be so bewildered by the glare of bayonets, that they do not see the men beyond. It is easy to understand how a belligerent editor, or a merchant infuriated by the destruction of his business, or a politician on the chase for power, should thus seek to change the whole character of this war. It is already proclaimed, in the leading journal of the city of New York, that this is not a political, but a military war. With all deference to the statergists of the Tribune office, I still believe we are a paternal government, going forth to restore a deluded people to allegiance, and not a military despotism ready to depose its own government, when it steps in the way of its arbitrary behests. I object to this sanguinary philosophy, because it is not forcible, but weak, as barbarism always is. The United States government, if inspired by the force of modern civilization, can use a great army in the office of restoring the Union, on a higher basis than it has ever rested. Its force is not so much the logic of the bullet, the cartridge and the cannon, as the varied, far-reaching power of a mighty civilization, concentrated against a mad rebellion. Our greatest forces are behind our bayonets; we use them only to clear away the lumber that impedes us. Our army of three hundred thousand is only a band of pioneers, sent southward to level the mountains and fill the valleys, and make everywhere a pathway for the approach of the second host of twenty million of freemen, who will shoot through all the realms of darkness the rays of light and love and peace. If civilization demands the gallows for any rebel leader, the destruction of any stronghold of treason, the forcible sundering of any order of society, we must submit. But let our force be that of Providence, that only sends the freshet to fertilize the field, and the thunderstorm to purity the air. If our army can vindicate on every rood of our vast territory the right of free expression for American ideas, it will be the most magnificent victory ever achieved; a new revelation in warfare, as our system is in politics. Let that be done, at all events. Let every Christian man and woman strengthen the hands of the government to do that, irresistibly, but in the spirit of humanity and parental discipline, which shall chain these rebellious communities to us by an indissoluble bond. Then this year's war will be only an episode in the grand drama of the establishment of a higher religion and society on American soil.
Indeed, it is our peculiar glory that we are strong enough to dispense with all rashness, revenge, piracy or rapine. We cannot afford to violate one precept of Christianity, in our dealing with our rebellious fellow-citizens. A barbarism that is smitten with mortal disease may as well die cursing and foaming; it is already damned, and it is only the difference of a few degrees of penal heat in hell whether it perished decently or wrathfully. The men who lead this rebellion, and the disorder of society they represent, have already done enough to cover themselves with infamy while the world shall last; they can afford to assassinate, rob, repudiate debts, murder for opinion's sake, legalize savage modes of warfare, or whatever will console them amid the pangs of dissolving nature. But the American civilization that is warring to overwhelm them is only in the beginning of its illustrious history; is to stretch down into ages of light and peace, when every dark blood-spot on its robes will be scanned by eyes of holy severity. It cannot afford, in the passion of the hour, to sacrifice one life too many, to disgrace our country by one questionable step. It is warring in the view of heaven, and all that represents heaven on earth; let its advance be like the procession of nature, and its progress represent the benediction of an all-wise and loving Providence.
3d. But let us look beyond this transient collision of arms to the more important movement of which it is the noisy herald. What has the new enthusiasm of the last months already done for the cause of advanced Religion; and if we prove worthy our mission, what new opportunities and achievements may we hope from it in the approaching future?
The lover of a progressive Religion has only reason to rejoice, thus far, over the great, uprising of our

people. It has already united good men of all religious creeds in a bond more vital than their sectarian church. It is wonderful how these high walls of theological separation, that seemed unscalable six months ago, have suddenly turned out only walls of paper, rolling together like a scroll" in the fervent heat of this great practical revival of manliness. I knew the hearts of a hundred priests the day after the bombardment of Sumter better than from all our previous life together. We always half knew these theological fortifications in which we played at besieging one another were the amusement of our idle years. That Sunday, we ceased the sham-fight of creeds and psalm-books, overleaped our petty ditches, and clasped one another's hands, as we all fell into line at the call of Humanity. If that day severed a thousand hearts from us in the regions of rebellion, it brought together tens of thousands of religions souls that had all their lives imagined themselves each others enemies.
It has also revealed to multitudes of men their real religious creed. In times of peace, when the social proprieties rule, it is hard for any body to know what he actually believes about God, man, duty, destiny. We fall among sets of people, schools, churches, cliques, and are overlaid by their platitudes till we imagine ourselves of them, and go on in parrot like volubility chattering the shibboleth of the party. But the President's proclamation was a call to every American-" Right about! Face yourself! Each of us, as our eye fell on the journal that Monday morning, found himself confronted with a stranger-his own spirit. Many a spiritual braggart quailed that morning; many a modest man or woman shot up into a hero or a heroine; many a boy sauntered down to a late breakfast, and marched away to the recruiting station a new-born man; many a parson shed his surplice and loosed his neckcloth, and stood up like unto his brethren. Men are now acting out what they really believe. Bishop Polk, of Louisiana, throws his canonicals out the window, and, waving aloft his commission of Brigadier from Jefferson Davis, proclaims himself openly the pirate he always was at heart. Dr. Spring, in the sleepy sanctity of the brick church," hears the war-cry on Broadway, flies to his attic and tears down his father's old continental musket and regimentals, marches over to Philadelphia, and in a voice that makes the bones of Israel Putnam and Ethan Allen stir in their coffins, commands the Old School Presbyterian Church to present arms! We are all so mixed nowadays, that nobody knows his old associates. The slumbering convictions that lay underneath the superficial crust of our humdrum life have exploded, hurling many of us into the middle of next week," as the children say. There is a hail storm of ecclesiastics-churchmen who have thus been shot out of the opinions of the middle ages into the middle of the nineteenth century. It is beautiful to see the enthusiasm of these newly-awakened men; it is good to be reinforced by their burning zeal. We shall never again distrust human nature as we did; but know that Truth only is biding her time when she seems dead.
There was never a time when man stood so well in the Church in America as to-day. A mighty practical danger has blown away, for the time, the whole cloud-land of future perdition for the non-elect. The care now in the sanctuary is, how to feed, dress, nurse and cheer the soldier; how to keep the wolf from the door of his home while he fights for the Republic; how to console the widow and mother; how to dispose of the captive; how to care for the fugitive. This is only a beginning of a great career of Christian philanthropy. What a change, when fashionable, young ladies no longer work altar-cloths and slippers, and bands for the priest, but havelocks, and handkerchiefs, and solid trowsers for the soldier! The next half century is to tax the practical power of the churches in caring for the race of bondmen who will be emancipated, and keeping up with the rush of emigration that our new States will bring upon us. God will be served through good deeds dune to his children.
And it is good to have such an expose of the ultra pietism and ecclesiasticism in the American Church as now appears. Without exception, this side of our religion has thrown out the pirates flag and gone over to the enemy. Through the whole revolted region, the Church plumed itself on its severe conservatism in creed and policy. We now see that ecclesiastical infallibility means treason to Republican institution. This revolution has struck the Roman Catholic Church amidships. It has demonstrated in America, what the uprising of nationality has revealed in Italy, that the mass of adherents to this church, like all others, follow their priesthood just to the point where they resist modern society, and then leave them to their prayers. The cry of American Freedom in her hour of peril brought Patrick and Herman to their feet, and when they had their hands upon the musket, and were marching down to Washington, the Bishop wisely concluded to hang out the Hag. Henceforth, the priesthood of this church, too, must follow, not lead the people. Twenty million of freemen will see what kind of religion is best for perilous times; whether rational Massachusetts or superstitious Louisiana started first to relieve the capital. Religious infallibility means slavery of the soul, as treason means slavery for the laborer. Our people will put these things together, and act accordingly.
It is a great thing thus to unite good men of all churches; to awaken the real creed of all citizens; to exalt man to his place in religious affairs; to unmask ecclesiastical infallibility. It clears the way for much that is to come; it shows how much the Reformation has already accomplished. None of us dared to hope we had so shaken the foundations of religious despotism that one three-month would cast down so much that now lies flat, never again to rise. The spectacle is full of hope to the apostle of a pure and free Religion. For if this conflict is carried through is it can be, and the Union reestablished upon the overthrow of the right of secession, and the black power that has dominated so long over us placed for ever in a secondary position, there will be such a missionary field opened for our advanced Protestant Christianity as this century has not witnessed. The South is not a land of darkness and decay, so much as a region arrested in its development by the temporary ascendancy of an insolent civil and religious aristocracy. Break down that barrier, open its vast areas to immigration; relieve the progressive class from the dread of violence; show to the poor white where his interest lies; summon the latent culture and humanity that now slumber on so many lazy plantations to the work of grappling with a new order of affairs; and there will be such an outstretching of arms towards the best ideas of modern society as will gladden all our hearts. The communities upon the border of the disputed territory are to be awakened to a new sense of religious need. Pennsylvania is to be aroused as by a great trumpet from her corrupt and sleeping conservatism of the past, and become conscious of her destiny in the coming regeneration. Maryland and Missouri are to come out of a baptism of fire, new communities. Washington is henceforth to be the base of operations whence all those religious and social ideas that have prevailed at the North are to radiate towards the tropics. The schoolmaster, the lecturer, the free editor, the liberal preacher, will follow the flag, arousing the people who rejoice beneath its folds to a new sense of the grandeur of life in this new day. Before the gradual uplifting of the popular faith, slavery and the whole order of society it represents, or whatever of it survives the violence of the ordeal of battle, will gradually disintegrate and change to freedom.
The condition of society in the Gulf States of this Republic is the logical child of the Spanish style of Religion and Government that was first planted in the New World. The spirit of that occupation was extermination to every race that could not be enslaved to its gloomy faith and tyrannical politics. The animus of this rebellion against modern ideas is that old black blood coursing through the veins of the statesmen and generals and social aristocracy of that region. It has made a rush upward against the pro
<c06>
gressive life; that dominates in the North, and, for a time, conquered a part of the border States for its battle-ground. This invasion means just what the great Spanish armada meant when it sailed up the English Channel; it moves upward with the same grandiloquent boasts and temporary success; it will scud back under bare poles before the Northern whirlwind, as did that distracted armament. The present end of this Northern struggle will be to carry our religions and social ideas down to the lowland ridge inhabited by the spiritual descendants of Cortes and the French discoverers of the Mississippi. The border States will be saved to our civilization; whether the order of society that now crushes the Gulf region will be gradually destroyed, or retire nearer the equator, is for the future to determine. But the Union now means, primarily, an advancing Religion, carrying along with it an advancing Civilization. Whatever names the faith of the Republic assumes-Catholic, evangelical, rationalistic-it will mean this: that infallible ecclesiasticisms, priesthoods and creeds will retire with the rebellion, and the Religion of God's paternal love of man follow our arm as they gleam under the sun of tropic skies.
Men on the eve of destruction often become prophets. When the Senators of old Virginia in the last Congress proclaimed that the Union was dead, and only a reconstructed Union possible, they were speaking by the inspiration of God. What they meant by reconstruction we all know; what God meant has manifested itself already among the mountains of their own State. Old Virginia claims to be the mother of the Union established by her great statesmen. To new Virginia may be given the sublime office of inaugurating the new Union in which all things will first be spiritually reconstructed" in behalf of liberty and mankind; and gradually all institution be made to conform to the exalted idea: Let no man be so weak as to suppose all this is to be completed in his generation; but let no man be so foolish as to doubt that it must come with the growth of years. We are in the twilight of a new day, in which the fidelity of our people will meet a great recompense. The poorest use a friend of progress now can make of his influence is to croak at to-day because it is not full of results that are sure to appear to our children. The best use to which we can all put our lives is to keep the spirit of the people high, patriotic, indomitable; aid our government to crush rebellion against its authority; and stand behind the line of bayonets with the sharper weapons of a progressive Christianity and pure society, ready to regenerate our falling foes, and confirm our new friends. Patriotism, for once in the history of man, means the best religion; and the " Union we seek to reestablish that of which the Master prayed, that they all may be one." Let us work hard, take long and broad views, trust in man, and believe in Almighty God; for surely we are building the highway over which the powers of the coining age of light and peace and love shall march triumphantly to the kingdom of heaven on earth.

IMPORTANT TESTIMONY.
Report of the Judges of the last Fair of the Massachusetts
Charitable Mechanic Association,
"FOUR PARKERS SEWING MACHINES. This Machine is so constructed that it embraces the combinations of the various patents owned and used by Elias Howe, Jr., Wheeler & Wilson, and Grover & Baker, for which these parties pay These, together with Parkers improvements, make it a beautiful Machine. They are sold from $ 10 to $120 each. They are very perfect in their mechanism, being adjusted before leaving the manufactory, in such a manner that they cannot get deranged. The feed, which is a very essential point in a good Machine, is simple, positive and complete. The apparatus for gauging the length of stitch is very simple and effective. The tension, as well another part, is well arranged. There is another feature which strikes your committee favorably, viz: there is no wheel below the table between the standards, to come in contact with the dress of the operator, and therefore no danger from oil or dirt. This machine makes the double lock-stitch, but is so arranged that it lays the ridge upon the back quite flat and smooth, doing away, in a great measure, with the objection sometimes urged on that account."

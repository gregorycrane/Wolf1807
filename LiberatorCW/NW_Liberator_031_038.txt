GOVERNMENT INGRATITUDE TO THE IRISH.
It is in the essence of government to be impartial to those that live under it. Being paternal by nature, and receiving existence for the achievement of the common good, it can never, with justice, draw a line of demarcation between its citizens. All that are under its sway have an equal right to its protection, to its benevolence, to its patronage. In return, it has an equal claim on the loyalty of the people. A partial State power is a tyrannous one, and open disaffection to it, in the classes injured, is both a natural consequence and very legitimate hostility. A government without strict impartial justice has no right to obedience, and we hope we shall never see such a system of rule entirely submitted to.
The present Administration at Washington has more than one blotch on it for partiality. It is by no means entitled to all our support. The slave principles of the men constituting it are, beyond all contradiction, a great deal of the cause of our actual troubles. It cannot be denied that they were uncompromising Abolitionists, and that their elevation to power has been much of the direct practical cause of the unfortunate act of disunion. A legitimate, dread of partial government, from Lincoln's Cabinet, has been a formidable agent in secession. If that magistrate had not been elected, the country would not now be disrupted. Himself and his ministers were always partizans.
When the war commenced, the Administration assumed a national air, which had the effect of waiting in its support the whole North. The native and the emigrant, the Whig, the Democrat, and the Abolitionist-all flocked together, then, like true patriots, around the pillars of the Constitution. The Government cast off-or appeared to cast off-every tincture of partisanship; and the people became one in sentiment to preserve the nation. No one will deny that the foreign citizens have shown themselves to be splendidly animated with this just and necessary principle of unity. They constitute more than five out of eight of the national army. Had they not enlisted, impressments could not be avoided. But they forgot not their oaths of citizenship; and when a national proclamation to take up arms was issued, they went in tens of thousands to the recruiting depots. Germans and Irish-our principal foreign citizens-immediately answered that call. But the Irishmen responded to it with amazing force. In the State of Pennsylvania alone, upwards of fifteen thousand of them patriotically obeyed the summons. Ex uno disce omnes. And all the Administration papers threw out baits for the Irish to enlist. Journals that had often before shamefully reviled them for misfortunes they could not help, and by misrepresentations no man of honor would think of, basely turned round when Sumter fell, and flattered, with fulsome rhetoric, every feature in their national vanity. This was done in Boston, in Philadelphia, in New York-in every city in. the North. But there was no necessity for the unprincipled subterfuge, and it did not succeed; Irish military spirit and loyalty to the country of their adoption are not the effect of the venal praise of newspapers. The two principles belong, in the largest measure, to themselves. The Administration papers did not induce a single Irish enlistment. If there were no papers in the country, that people would have answered the President's proclamation; and when they answered it, they did so from their own nature and judgment. The importance of their response appeared at the battle of Manassas. It was evident in the extravagant flattery employed to cajole them into the army. And it appears now, in the common acknowledgment of the country, that the Irish element is decidedly the best in the national forces. If the Irish had not enlisted, how would the army have been made up? If the 69th had not been at Manassas, what would have been the result of the day? If the Irish should now withdraw from the war, how would the war be carried on?-how could the rebellion be ever suppressed? We shall wait for answers to these questions, but we fear we must wait for a long time. The whole fact is-without Irish soldiers, the war cannot be well carried on.
From these numerous facts, it is plain that the Administration at Washington should not treat our Irish fellow-citizens in an exclusive manner-in a partial way-by a rule exhibitive of decided preference for other people; that they should receive a fair amount of the public patronage. Such, however, is far from being the case. On the 29th of July, by a single order from the Secretary of the Navy, fifty Irishmen were dismissed from the single Navy Yard of Charlestown, because they were foreigners, and their places given to an equal number of fanatic Abolitionists.
We submit that this is a degenerate act. Had it been perpetrated at any other time, we might pass it over; but doing it at the moment in which the Irish element is the most important feature in our army, is committing an enormous violation of decency. It is an act of deep ingratitude to the Irish themselves, and a grievous outrage on the common sentiment of the whole North. But Lincoln and his Cabinet were always partisans. True national men they can never be. Our satisfaction is, that they will not be always in office; and that it was not their influence or character, but the dangers which threatened the Constitution, that made the North unite, and the Irish to enlist
In the meantime, there ought to be a public meeting in Boston, on this shameful partizan act. It is an act that insults the common Union sentiment of the Northern States. The community especially outraged by it, is under an obligation to make a spirited protest. Faneuil Hall can be easily obtained-if not, some other hall may be. Boston and Charlestown owe it to themselves, and to the country, to show the Administration that it is not the season for Know-nothing partizanship to be brought into operation. Partizan governments deserve no support, and the sooner their day is ended the better. Oh! that America were never infested by mere politicians!-Boston Pilot.

DRIVE THEM OUT.
The New Orleans Delta of the 13th rejoice over the Contemplated expulsion of citizens of the United states "from the Confederated States." The law, it states, is, and the fact is confirmed from other sources, that all owing citizenship to this Government are to be banished from the Confederated States. The Delta advises the worst, and says:-
"We cannot afford to tolerate enemies in our midst, because, forsooth, they may have the discretion to keep silent, and to bear no arms in their hands. The man of Massachusetts, or the man of Kentucky, living, and perhaps thriving in our midst, has no business at this time to be among us, if he allows a reasonable suspicion to exist that he is not also cordially with us."

DONE CANNOT BE UNDONE.
To the Editor of the Bradford (Eng.) Advertiser:
SIR,-When the great moral institution of Slavery is trembling in the balance, it is impossible to be writing on those subjects of local and limited interest, which, of whatever importance to some, must for the moment give way. Everything in its season; apples in apple-harvest, and potatoes in potato time. It may not be much that can be done, but it may be something. Some, gasping soul may receive a hint that there are other interests in the world besides keening the negro to slavery in the cotton-field; and the effect may be felt, as has been said of a drop of water at London Bridge, though oceans roll between.
It is impossible to deny that, on this occasion, the English government and public have made a humbling spectacle. Various causes have concurred. The true, real, and almost only honest and heartfelt enemies of slavery,-who were the Society of Friends,-have been in some sort put out of the field, by a question of war being involved. They did not object to slavery in the West Indian Islands being put down by Act of Parliament, because they saw no probability of troops being called to march; but they cannot be expected to enter on the question of whether the American government should move upon rebellion by declaring slavery non-existent, or confine itself to the defence of Washington.
These, then, are estimable friends prevented by circumstances from showing themselves in line. And in aid of this misfortune, come two grand frauds. One, the fraud of those who stand on the distinction between slavery and the slave trade: giving up the last because they cannot help it; and doing their best to befriend the other. And the way they do it is by calling it a "domestic institution,"-and Heaven forefend we should touch anybody's" domestic institution"! As if Holy Writ did not tell of "domestic institutions." or which; at all events, were attempted to be thrust into honest men's houses! Or as if highway manhood and foot-padry were not domestic institutions, in the families that live by them! It is of a piece with those early counsels, which denounced negro liberty in St. Domingo as an "unexampled nuisance."
The second engine of deception, arising in some, no doubt, from ignorance of the steps by which a national mind is brought to the sticking point, is that which throws cold water on any display of interest by the English public, by representing that the American government and people have not, up to the day when the last mail left, made any unanimous and point-blank declaration of their hostility to slavery. As if you English did anything of the kind at once! As if it was not honest men struggling against odds here, as honest men are struggling in America, cultivating every opening for good, and nursing every chance of increased adherence to their cause, instead of ducking it in the cold water bath of grumbling that it is not more! In aid of these come the "nameless horrors" alarmists, whose foolish and indecent outcry, it is hoped, will be replied to by a demand for the abolition of slavery from the women of the South, in the first portion of country which is freed from the oppression of force. The heart knows its own bitterness; and their hearts no doubt know theirs, if they had power to tell it.
The upshot is, that, in one way or another, the Anti-Slavery party in England is in bad hands. The enemy is in their staff and head-quarters, and American friends must make allowance for it. To such of these as will give a hearing to a voice from the old country, the real English Anti-Slavery men would say, "Either go a sensible way to work, or let it all alone. But do not make what the Hindoos call 'monkey business.' Every man who knows anything of East-Indian war, knows that an army of 10,000 whites cannot stir a step without 40,000 natives, military and non-military, to assist. The necessity springs from climate, and is everywhere the same. Stay-at-home people have strange ideas about the 'luxuries of the East;' but they may depend on it, no man gets more of these than what keeps him on his legs. The rebel party has the natives now, and sets them to make entrenchments you are expected to run against. These aids might just as well be yours, if common sense is common enough in America to ask for it. Be persuaded, this fishing for the enemy's fortified positions to run against,-as the French officer said of the cavalry charge at Balaclava,-'may be very fine, but it is not war.' Your generals cannot help knowing this, but their souls are not their own. They are overborne by wolves in sheep's clothing. It would be highly immoral to secure a native army and followers, for service in the Southern States; it is highly moral to turn the same resources over to the enemy, that he may build batteries to run your children's heads against! All this cannot go on; it is too contrary to the current of human sense and feelings. It is not likely that anything said here can contribute much to the conclusion. But there is an English interest in removing the impression, that there is nobody in the old country who knows more about the matter than those who appropriate the title of Economist The notion of campaigning in the Southern States without three or four black men to one white,-and, still more, of keeping four millions of black allies at arm's length, and sending them to work in the enemy's trenches,-is too childish to be entertained by anybody of man's estate. But take your choice; this is a world of trial. Give up your sons to slaughter, that slave-auctioneers may still handle female flesh as carcass-butchers grope horned cattle by the stern, to see how they are off for fat. Sell out your good Pennsylvania's, to nay these men for making war upon you, and rebelling against your government! Perhaps if you make haste, they will take off ten percent. Do all this if you like, and comfort yourselves that you have saved a 'domestic institution.' But do not retire to bed under the idea that Anti-Slavery men in England counseled it."
Since "done cannot be undone," the only thing is to try to do better. The advice is as old as the hills, that "if we had done everything we ought to do, and had been unfortunate, there might be reason for depression; but if we have done everything we ought not to do, and left undone everything we ought to do, there may be lively hope that, on doing better, things will mend." There must be no more fighting without a cause; and having a cause which would open every lock before them, if they choose to use it, they must not, like John Bunyan's pilgrims, "lie in a stinking dungeon, with the key called Promise in" their pocket. And when they fight, it must be with a plan connected with this cause. There mast be no more of the battling of kites and crows, which consists in every one scratching where scratch can. Their generals, too, must contrive not to give them such good escape backwards. It is nothing but what took place with the first French armies under Dumourier; and it was not many
<c03>
weeks before the tiling was mended. Dumonrier, like a gallant soldier, instead of grumbling, wrote to the Convention, "Toutest repair." In the meantime, a good deal is to be done by leading; there is no use in being ill-humored because a young horse shies. Make much of him, and bring him up again; and by-and-by he will go through fire and water. There must be an end, by the way, of the childish dread of cavalry. Cavalry has its uses, and one use is to assist in opposing the movements of a hostile cavalry. But the first discovery of the democratic soldier, in all ages, has been that cavalry is no match for infantry that have their wits about them. The Roman legion, the Macedonian phalanx, the English archers, the Swiss pikemen, the German, Swedish and French musketeers, though feebly armed in comparison with modern improvements, all desired no better than that cavalry would be unwise enough to throw themselves upon their ranks. A few hundred French grenadiers, with a field-piece or two, would hold their own against all the Mamelukes in the world. But then the men were disciplined; they were a military machine. Not that cavalry, either, is without its uses; and there can be no ignorance on this head. The United States dragoons must have had considerable experience. As regards volunteer forces, an officer of dragoons in India, an American by birth, and who is understood to have afterwards gone into the American service, used to celebrate as splendidly mounted, a corps of volunteer cavalry formed by the butchers of New York. To a certainty, he knew what mounting was; and if he is still in serviceable order, he might give information on the ways of using native followers and campaigning in hot countries. His name was Robinson of the 17th; and if he is to the fore, I beg my remembrances, and the sooner he is a major-general, the better.
Yours, sincerely,
T. PERRONET THOMPSON.
Eliot Yale, Blackheath, Aug. 29, 1861.

IN FOR A FINAL SETTLEMENT.
Advices begin to come, indicating more or less of discomfiture on the part of the rebels, and more or less of increasing strength and success on the part of the Federal Government. Such a turn of the tide was to be expected. If it has not already fairly begun, there is good reason for believing it near at hand. This change, even though it be for the better, has its danger as well as promise. It may lead to premature anxiety, not to say premature movements, looking to too speedy and too hasty adjustment of affairs, before the best end and the most desirable end is fairly and squarely reached.
It can hardly be pretended that the contest now is for the limited purpose for which it was begun on our side. Then, very properly, that purpose was confined simply to holding the positions still retained by the Government, and retaking those stolen by treachery, or captured by force and treachery combined. As the contest has proceeded, the aspect of things has altered very decidedly. The formidable character, the immense audacity, and the ulterior designs of the long-concerted and widely-spread treason have become more evident; and of consequence the peril to the nation, and the necessity for an exertion of the whole of the nation's strength and resources to annihilate this treason, have been made every day clearer. The do-nothing policy of the previous administration, and the wise forbearance and conciliatory temper of the present, at the outset and until the rebellion was meanly guilty of murderous overt acts, were hardly objected to by the people, desirous of peace, at any cost, save the loss of honor and all that makes peace worth having. But the opposing parties do not stand to-day where they stood a year or six months ago. The patience of the loyal people, on the one hand, and the desperate madness of the insurgent leaders on the other, growing more daring by a misapprehension of that patience, have brought the country to a crisis most momentous in itself and in its consequences.
The people, true to the republic, find themselves summoned to consecrate everything to its defence and preservation. They are called upon for men and treasures, for sacrifices of business and of the prosperity of peaceful times, to an extent which no foreign war would have required. Everything has given way and is subservient to the exigency of the hour,-to the conduct of the great contest which is to decide what power, or rather what principle, shall rule over this land.
Now, by as much as the endeavor has been to avoid, ward off, and postpone this contest, by just so much, since it has come upon us, should it be waged to a finality in the way of settlement. Virtually we are undergoing a second revolution, fighting another battle for freedom. The references and appeals made to the spirit of '76 have not been meaningless-they are instinctive perceptions of the truth of the case. We are in arms against the only remaining foe to a republican government-no less a foe because of domestic origin. We are meeting to-day, on the battle-field, the wily enemy of the country we have been trying in vain to bribe into friendliness, by concessions and compromises, which he accepted only until he believed himself strong enough to throw off the mask and spurn them. To confront him, and insure a victory over his despotic machinations, has cost, already, a heavy draft upon our resources. Summoned-against our wishes-to pay this great price for freedom, but ready to pay it, and a thousand times more, if need be, it behooves us to be sure that we gain all we contend for, and that we cut our way with the sword to a final adjustment
Everybody must see that it would be as impolitic and unwise, as it would be cowardly trifling with sacred interests, to pause now for any half-way negotiations, any patched-up and temporary treaties. The Slave Power, as a political power, must now be buried past all hope of resurrection. It has carried on its selfish and exacting intrigues long enough; and since it has insanely invited the death-blow, it should have it up to the hilt. Then, also, now is the day to make the grossly deceived South know, understand and respect the people of the free States for just what they are; and to learn the secret of their prosperity. It has come to be a necessity that the North must vindicate its libeled character at the cannon's mouth. Let not the cannon cease to speak until the necessity is fully met.
In a word-leaving the peculiar institution to take care of itself as it best may, as a local institution, except as military exigencies may be compelled to interfere with it-the hour is here for a final determination that these States shall be united under a strictly republican form of government, in spin as well as in the letter, that the Constitution shall be construed in favor of freedom, and that under such construction freemen shall be undisturbed and unsexed in the building up and management of a pioneer nation of the Christian civilization, of the future. The hour is here for this work. Let it be met, and let its high behests be obeyed. Let the putting down of the rebellion be so entire that the result shall inaugurate, beyond the power of any faction or section to hereafter endanger them, those
<c04>
broad, generous, humane principles-the liberty and equality secured by just laws, which can alone meet the requirements of the age, and secure for this country its glorious destiny.-Boston Transcript.

THE BEGINNING OF THE END.
We run no risk in stating that, in decreeing the emancipation of the slaves owned by rebels in the State of Missouri, General Fremont has neither, on the one hand, relied upon the recent Act of Congress relating to confiscation, nor, on the other, exceeded the proper limits of his authority as General commanding. Under his proclamation of martial law, all State and municipal laws were at once suspended, and he, as commanding General, was practically invested with dictatorial powers over persons and property, for the just use of which powers he tacitly undertook to render account when martial law ceased to exist in his Department.
The direct consequences of his decree, so far as slavery in Missouri is concerned, cannot be of much importance. Missouri does not contain 125,000 slaves, and of these considerably more than one half are believed to be held by loyal men. Moreover, under the terms of Fremont's proclamation, no slave can be emancipated until it is proved that his owner has been actually in arms, or laboring actively in aid of those who are in arms against the Government: a large number of slaves may thus be defrauded of emancipation through the want of evidence to establish the treason of their masters. It is doubtful whether 25,000 human beings will exchange slavery for freedom under the proclamation of Gen. Fremont.
But its moral effect must be signal. It is a solemn warning to the inhabitants of the rebel States, that wherever the armies of the United States are resisted in the interests of slavery, the cause of the resistance will be removed. It is a pregnant hint that the rebels who have falsely accused us of being Abolitionists may, if they choose, make their accusation true. It is a notification to Kentucky, which seems to be on the eve of explosion, that open treason will necessarily involve the extirpation of slavery. This rebellion has more than once recalled the old adage, "Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first render mad": we shall now see how far the madness extends. The cost of rebellion is abolition. Those who choose may purchase.
Another important result of General Fremont's proclamation has been the discovery of the fact that the people of the North are much more solidly united on the question of slavery than was imagined. It had been generally supposed that the first utterance of the cry of emancipation would divide the North into two hostile camps. How this strange delusion came to be entertained, it is difficult to discover; the least reflection should have satisfied every one that it was impossible to build up at the North a party based on protection to slavery anywhere. But, however the notion originated, there is no doubt it did exist, and that leading men and journals in the confidence of the Administration were so thoroughly imbued with it, that they indignantly repudiated the imputation of being friendly to freedom under any circumstances. It seems, from the temper in which the public receive General Fremont's proclamation, that they are not so tender on the subject. They seem very well satisfied with the prospect. We hear no complaints, no lamentations over the downfall of slavery in Missouri. The respectable Democrats of this part of the country express themselves rather pleased than otherwise. Of course, it must be expected that the lottery-policy dealers and the profligate vagabonds who pretend to represent the Democracy in convention will testify their sorrow at the event, as they will do at every success of the national arms: but neither in this nor in any other particular do they express the sense of the rank and file of the Democracy.
What people want now is decided, startling, effective successes on the part of the United States. If these are achieved, no one will complain of what they may cost. Our Generals may emancipate every slave in the country, and lay waste every field from the Potomac to the Rio Grande-the people will sustain them, provided they crush out the enemy and restore the supremacy of the Government. But there will be no mercy for the General who, for fear of breaking a law or dividing a party, suffers the rebels to progress from victory to victory, and the Stars and Stripes to endure defeat after defeat, and disgrace after disgrace.-Harper's Weekly, Sept. 14.

BUT ONE WAT OUT.
To our apprehension, God is fast closing every avenue to settled peace but by emancipation. And one of the most encouraging facts is that the eyes of the nation are becoming turned in that direction quite as rapidly as could have been anticipated. Some men of conservative antecedents, like Dickinson of New York, saw this necessity from the first. But it takes time to accustom a whole people to the thought, and to make them see the necessity. It was impossible for Northern men to fathom the spirit and the desperate exigencies of the slave system and its outbreak, and consequently to comprehend the desperate nature of the struggle. We were like a policeman endeavoring to arrest a boy-ruffian, and, for the sake of his friends and for old acquaintance sake, doing it with all possible tenderness for his person and his feelings-till all of a sudden he feels the grip on his throat and the dagger's point at his breast, and knows that it is a life-and-death grapple.
Slaveholding is simply piracy continued. Our people are beginning to spell out that short and easy lesson in the fight of perjury, robbery, assassination, poisoning, and all the more than Algerine atrocities of this rebellion. It cannot require many more months of schooling like the last eight, to convince the dullest of us what are its essence and spirit.
Our people also are rapidly finding out that no peaceful termination of this war will be permitted now by the Slave Power, except by its thorough overthrow. The robber has thrown off the mask, and says now to the nation, "Your life or mine." Even the compromising Everett has boldly told the South, "To be let alone is not all you ask-but you demand a great deal more." And in his late oration he has most powerfully portrayed the impossibility of a peaceful disunion. Many men, some anti-slavery, were at first inclined to yield to the idea of a separation. But every day's experience is scattering that notion to the winds. The ferocious spirit exhibited from the first by the Secessionists towards all dissentients, the invasion of Western Virginia by Eastern, the threats to put down loyal Kentucky, the foray in Missouri, the plan for capturing Washington, which was part of the original scheme, are convincing proofs that if by any pacification whatever our troops were disbanded to-day, to-morrow a Southern army would be on the march for Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and perhaps Chicago.
The South has sufficiently declared the cause of this trouble to be the irreconcilable conflict between their institutions and the fundamental principles of this government. While the cause remains in full strength, and after it has once burst forth in bloody
<c05>
and final collision, nothing will ever check that strife, whether in or out of the Union. The cause must be eradicated. Meanwhile, our own position, both before the world and in our own struggle at home, is a false one, so long as we blink the real issue.
Many indications are hopeful. Gen. Butler's letter to the Secretary of War, and the Secretary's reply, look in the right direction. The Confiscation Act is pregnant with great consequences, and may yet be so used as to become an emancipation act in all the rebel States. It is high time it were so used. We have serous doubts whether the rebellion will ever be suppressed till that trenchant weapon is wielded. We reverently doubt whether the Lord means it shall be.
The quiet passage of the Confiscation Act was an immense step of governmental progress. Perhaps it was all that the nation as a whole and the government were ready for. It may answer as a keen wedge. But we trust that, in December, Congress will make a clean work by the full emancipation of all slaves in the rebel States, and by provision in some way for the speedy and certain extinction of slavery in the loyal States. To accomplish the latter event, we would ourselves willingly submit to any proper amount of pecuniary burden, provided it could be so arranged as not to recognize a right of property in man.-Chicago Congregational Herald.

MISSOURI.
No part of our country presents greater points of interest at the present time than Missouri. The recent proclamation of Gen. Fremont has turned all eyes in that direction. None condemn his declaration of martial law. It was not a day too soon. His warning that all traitors in arms within the military lines would be tried by court-martial, and if found guilty, shot, is the only mode of treating this piratical rebellion. None condemn him for this obvious, wise and humane decision. The personal and real property of rebels is pronounced confiscate. This is also approved by the loyal part of the country.
In the midst of this general approval, comes up a faint rumbling cry of dissatisfaction, because the slaves of rebels are declared to be FREE MEN. Why, in the name of our country, is this kind of property to be held more sacred than any other? Are they not laboring to raise provisions for the rebels? Are they not employed on their fortifications, and even in a military capacity? No other "property" can be so important in the rebels. Yet, we have some thin-skinned individuals who demur at this manifest duty of the bold mountaineer commander of our Western army. They want the same thing done, but they want it glossed over with "contraband of war," or some other circumlocution, which shall not say that they are free men. Nonsense! Gen. Fremont is not the man to become a slave-dealer or a slave-driver. This is a slave-driver's rebellion, and the "contraband of war" plea recognizes a kind of property in man as in horses and other chattels. Gen. Fremont will not stultify himself by admitting as right what these slave-drivers are fighting for. The moment he holds slave property more sacred than any other, he admits just what the rebels say, viz: that slave property should have the protecting care of the government above all other. But the "department of the west" is not involved in this stupid, timid-we had almost said-cowardly nonsense. ALL property of rebels is declared confiscate, and no civilized law, except that of States enjoying sovereignty by virtue of their loyalty, can recognize property in man. No power exists to sell or dispose of slaves by virtue of civilized military law, and they become, by virtue of the act of confiscation, absolutely, what Gen. Fremont declares them, FREE MEN. He has no power, by virtue of his office, to dispose of them otherwise, If he should sell them, he would deserve to be condemned with the barbarians who trade on the African coast. If he should compel them to labor without compensation, he would be scorned by the whole civilized world. He has done just what honesty, frankness, and a military necessity demanded-nothing more, nothing less. The country and the work will commend him for it, and he will add to his fame by being the first to boldly declare such entire confiscation.-Chester County Times.

AN EVENTFUL WEEK.
Our columns, to-day, bear witness that the past week has been fraught with grave and startling events, of more than usual national importance. The brilliant victory at Hatteras, achieved by our galland land and naval forces under the lead of Gen. Butler and Commodore Stringham, which has infused new life into our citizen soldiers, and additional lustre to our arms, securing for the Government a foothold in the rebel Slates of immense strategic and commercial value, and teaching the traitors the salutary and important lesson that their madness and folly are fast bringing upon their devoted land the terrible doom which the inexorable fiat of retributive justice, sooner or later, metes out to every people whose material prosperity or social position is based upon slavery,-the Proclamation by General Fremont, declaring Missouri under martial law, and offering freedom to the long-suffering, down-trodden slave, thus following in the footsteps of the Hero Jackson, and accepting the leadership of the grand and glorious emancipation movement, destined soon to be the controlling issue of the war, and the speediest method to accomplish a lasting and honorable cessation of internecine strife,-the uprising throughout Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee, of the Union men, and their determination to aid the Federal Government in its attempt to crush out the traitors who have belied the true sentiment of the people, and, by fraud and violence, sought to drag down to the bottomless abyss of political and moral perdition three of the brightest stars in our national galaxy,-the disaffection, -sickness, poverty, hunger and death, stalking hand in hand over the doomed and stricken South, and scourging it with terrific fury,-and last, not least, the cheating of the gallows by the death from disease of the arch-traitor and rebel, Jeff. Davis, who is reported, and with considerable probability, to have died at Richmond, Va., on Monday or Tuesday,-all unite to render the past few days epochs of unusual significance. [The report of the death of J. Davis proves erroneous.]
It was peculiarly fitting that Major General Benjamin F. Butler, of Massachusetts, should lead the expedition whose signal success has cast such, refulgent glory upon our arms,-the man who, long before the Administration dared to grapple with the subject, with wonderful legal acuteness cut, with his sword, the Gordian knot of slavery, and, by a dash of his pen, showed to the world that it was not only possible to metamorphose slaves into freemen, without interfering with musty parchment deeds of wrong, or bringing down upon the barbaric masters the vengeance that long years of oppression had awakened in the hearts of their victims, but that it was the only practicable method of dealing with the question,-and it needed but this to prove to the country that the old Bay State only nurtures brave and loyal hearts, and, that such a man as Butler
<c06>
brought up under the shadow of Bunker Hill, and within view of Faneuil Hall, could not, when brought face to face with the giant wickedness of our country, prove false to the teachings of her past history, and turn traitor to the State wherein he had learned the duty and responsibilities of a free son of New England. It was right and just that the gallant standard-bearer of Liberty in 1856, the pioneer of civilization in other days across the desert wastes and beyond the rocky barrier of the western world; who planted in the El Dorado of the Pacific our starry banner, and in the name of the Union took possession of that virgin soil, teeming with inexhaustible treasure; who, but him, should unfold that emblem of deliverance upon the slave-cursed lands of the South, and rally around him the bravest and truest men of our country in this new crusade of Freedom?
All hail, then, to Butler and Fremont, the brave and loyal son of Massachusetts, and the gallant Pathfinder, who opens a way for Freedom into the benighted regions of our land, and who, with sword in hand, will press on, undaunted, until rebellion is crushed forever, and the chains shall be stricken, from the limbs of four millions of American bondmen!-Sandwich Advocate.

SLAVEHOLDING UNIONISTS.
Much is said about a class of slaveholders who are supposed to be Unionists, and the policy of the Government, in its conduct of the war, is shaped very much with a view of conciliating them. For this reason, the fugitive slaves of Unionists are returned. For this reason, the Government hesitates to declare the fugitive slaves, held and employed by Gen. Butler as "contraband," free. For this reason, the Government permits, if it does not instruct, its generals to issue proclamations, declaring their readiness to put down insurrections of slaves, thus repelling from their standard hundreds of thousands of loyal men, who would be glad to fight the battles of their country!
But who are these slaveholding Unionists, and how many of them are they, for the sake of whose aid the aid of these hundreds of thousands are spurned?
Every slaveholder who desires to continue being a slaveholder-every slaveholder who desires the continuance of slavery-is either a Secessionist, or else he is a Unionist conditionally-the condition being that, in his opinion, slavery can be maintained more certainly within the Union than outside of it.
There is not, probably, a single exception to this rule. The slaveholder, wishing to retain slaves and to perpetuate slavery, holds slavery paramount to the Union, and will abandon the Union the very first moment that he thinks slavery can be better secured outside of the Union than inside of it. The policy of the Government, and of its generals, is evidently founded upon the supposition that this is so. They dare not do anything to disturb slavery, lest they should lose the cooperation of such Unionists.
The first question is, how much is the cooperation of such Unionists worth, if we could have never so many of them?
The second question is, how many such slave-holding Unionists have we in the country-and in a position to render us any assistance?
I. What is the loyalty worth that is conditioned on a national protection of slavery? The present condition of the country would seem to furnish an answer to that question. So long as the Government was but the servile tool of the slaveholders, affording them its pap and its protection of slavery, so long they remained "loyal," and no longer. Just so fast as they have given up the hope of a continuance of the old state of things, they have given up their allegiance to the Union.
The difference between a loyal and disloyal slaveholder is not a difference of principle or of character, but only a difference of calculations and of circumstances.
The probability is, that the country has more to fear from the treachery of Union slaveholders than from the open opposition of the Rebels.
II. How many of these slaveholding Unionists are there, who are in a condition to render us any assistance? We can count upon none, out of three or four border States. A thousand or two of such would, we think, be a large estimate. But what if they were ten, twenty, or thirty thousand? If unreliable, as we hold them to be, the more of them, the worse.
But allowing them to be reliable, and to number thirty or even forty thousand men, can we afford to offset these against ten times the number of stalwart, muscular negroes, inured to labor, to hard fare, to privation, and panting for freedom?
The able-bodied male slaves, capable of bearing arms, may be put down at 700,000. This, estimate is based upon the Evening Post's estimate of the military capabilities of the State of New York, which has a population somewhat short of that of the slaves. But we will take the Poses statement of enrolled militia of the State of New York, namely, 400,000, which, it says, the State could spare for the army, without danger to the home defence. The slaves could as easily furnish us with the same number, as our readers are already aware.
For the sake of securing the help of 30,000 slave-holding Unionists, then, we repel the help of 400,000 slaves!
The proportion is as 30 to 400, or as 3 to 40, or as 1 to 13 1-3!
On what principle of military science, or of wise statesmanship, can we afford to do this?
What is it but servility, deep-seated, habitual, inveterate servility, that causes either the people or the Government to hold back, or to hesitate, for a moment, in a case so perfectly transparent?- Principia.

PLAIN TALK IN KENTUCKY.
This is the way Andrew Johnson talks to the people of Kentucky, in his recent speech at Newport, in that State:-
"Slavery was made the pretext to break up our glorious Union. There was no right violated, and never could be, if the people would abide by the Constitution. But, thank God! the people of the United States did net, do not, sanction this unholy rebellion. The leaders of it tell yon here in Kentucky that slavery is in danger; but it is only a pretext to terrify you, and draw you into the yawning gulf of secession. I am a Southern man, sharing the prejudices of my section, and I am no Abolitionist, but I tell you, my fellow-countrymen, that secession has done more harm to-day than all the Abolitionists in the country put together since we were a nation. (Cheers.)
Men talk about their rights; will you go to the South to get them? Will you tell them in the South to come here and get them for you? (Cries of' No!) Your distinguished representative in the United States Senate-I say distinguished, for I use terms of respect toward him, as I would toward any
The United Stated Constitution is "a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell."
What order of men under the most absolute of monarchies, or the most aristocratic of republics, was ever invested with such an odious and unjust privilege as that of the separate and exclusive representation of less than half a million owners of slaves, in the Hall of this House, in the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential mansion? This investment of power in the owners of one species of property concentrated in the highest authorities of the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of the twenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privileged order of men in the community, more adverse to the rights of all, and more pernicious to the interests of the whole, than any order of nobility over known. To call government thus constituted a Democracy is to insult the understanding of mankind.... It is doubly tainted with the infection of riches and of slavery. There is no name in the language of national jurisprudence that can define it- no model in the records of ancient history, or in the political theories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. It was introduced into the Constitution of the United States by an equivocation-a representation of property under the name of persons. Little did the members of the Convention from the Free States imagine or foresee what a sacrifice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of this concession."-JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.

LETTER FROM RICHARD D. WEBB.
DUBLIN, August 24, 1861.
To the Editor of the Anti-Slavery Standard:
After a pleasant and busy week spent in attending the meetings of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, which has just concluded its sittings, I turn to the much less gratifying task of making some remarks on the report of the First of August celebration at Abington, which has just reached me in the columns of the Anti-Slavery Standard. The portions of the report to which I specially refer are, the letter which was read at the meeting from the Hon. N. H. Whiting, with whose name, as an Abolitionist, I have long been familiar, and the speech of Wendell Phillips. I assure you that, when I read the letter and the speech. I felt as if I had plunged my hand into a bunch of nettles, or like a child when his breath is taken away by a sudden dip in cold water. Not I alone, but all those whom I have long known as the ardent, indefatigable, zealous friends of the anti-slavery cause, the admiring and faithful friends of the Abolitionists since their claims to our affection and respect were first known to us, are utterly confounded to find ourselves regarded as jealous, envious, ignorant, malignant, in excusable, and hateful, by the Hon. N. H. Whiting, who has no personal knowledge of us whatever; and by Wendell Phillips (who knows some of us at least, and whom we all greatly venerate,).) as the citizens of three populous kingdoms (the homes of his own ancestors.) who are ready to perpetrate any meanness and any crime, any violence or any fraud, for the purpose of securing the friendship of the Confederate States, at the price even of the continued slavery of her four million of bondsmen and bonds women.
When I ask the honorable men and honorable women with whom I have been so long united by the delightful ties of anti-slavery intimacy, what does all this means, not one of them can tell me. It seems too ridiculous that, without any change on our part of conduct or feeling, we and all belonging to us, and the swarming millions of these two populous islands, should be set down as the basest and meanest of mankind, for no other reason that we can discover, except that our government have agreed to treat eight or nine million of your late� Southern brethren� as belligerents that is, as people at war (which they are), and that they refuse to undertake the responsibility of treating them as pirates, in which case the American people and government (who like to pick a quarrel with us) would promptly protest against our intermeddling brutality.
Really and truly, I do not think that, since the world began, any instance has ever been known of a civilized nation showing such hearty readiness to turn against another on grounds so utterly frivolous. It would have been another matter if we had shown sympathy, or encouragement, or good will to the seeders. But nothing of the kind has been shown. They are simply regarded with disgust by as many as know anything about them. It has always seemed to me that you are continually exposed to be carried away by the tremendous onset of the tide of public opinion, which rolls on your side of the water, with a force of which we can form no adequate idea. Here there is such a diversity of ranks and classes, cliques and coteries from the laborer on the laud through all the gradations of artisans, tradesmen, shopkeepers, merchants, bankers, professional men, landholders and noblemen, up to the queen on her throne, (on which she very seldom sits.) and all these classes are so little influenced by the opinions and prejudices of any class but their own, that I suspect we have much more individual liberty of thought and action than is enjoyed by you, with all your republican privileges. You are the sovereign people, and when you are mastered by any sovereign impulse, you are all swept along by the tide. Up to the present time, it has always been felt by us who know you, that the Abolitionists alone have stood on their legs, maintained their own opinions and held on their own course, led by the Higher Law and the guiding light of their own heartfelt humane convictions. This present crisis has appeared to some of us too strong for some of you, and that you have been hurried by your national pride and patriotic enthusiasm into a vehemence of indignation against the slaveholders, which is the less accountable from those who knew them so well, than it is when manifested by their dupe and sycophants, the great majority of the Northern people. The hostile spirit manifested against us is the more extraordinary, as, beyond this verbal offence of calling the rebels belligerents, we have really been as quiet as lambs and as meek as mice, and have evinced a ridiculous anxiety to give you no offence whatever, if we could by any possibility keep from annoying you, and still hold the breath in our bodies. Why. there was Lord Brougham, so anxious to keep us all sitting pretty, with our hands folded before us, like four-year old pupils at a dame-school, that he declared he would use all his influence to keep us from holding any anti-slavery meetings, lest, perchance, you should be affronted. All this time you kept on returning fugitive slaves, sending home Southern prisoners on their parole of honor (!), and evincing a polite tenderness for rebel editors, a courtesy to seceding ladies, and a forbearance to traitorous office-holders at your seat of government that, we venture to think, was fully as deserving of the Hon. N. H. Whiting's uncomplimentary adjectives as our unpardonable, crime in defining the rebels by a term which you yourselves fully recognize by all your behavior towards them. To you, O editor! I have no objection to make. Like a sensible man, you approved of my poor letters; and like another sensible man, I heartily endorsed your admirable leaders, and, accordingly, when you come to Dublin, I shall be very happy to make your acquaintance. As to the Hon. N. H. Whiting and Mr. Wendell Phillips, I shall have a crow to pluck with them, for I am sure they have judged us ungenerously and unjustly, and I hope to hear of their sitting on the stool of repentance.

THE HOUR AND THE MAN.
BY MRS. HARRIET BEECHER STOTWE.
At last, a blow has been struck which finds an echo in the heart of a whole nation, and will find an echo in the hearts of the whole civilized world. The hour has come, and the man!
Fremont's proclamation has in it that genuine military ring, that martial directness, for which the heart of the people in disturbed times always longs. They long for the man without fear whose sword divides all meshes of compromise, all fine-spun legal doubts and hesitancies who is not afraid to take the responsibility of a thorough movement in a critical hour, and who does something splendid and decided, while the rest of the world are feebly and perplexedly making up their minds what to do.
Not often has the opportunity of so splendid a deed been given to any one mortal. To right wrong to uphold law to give liberty to the slave by one majestic declaration, is the privilege of one in centuries. Fremont has done it and every heart through the nation leaps up at the news, as the human heart always leaps at what is grand and heroic.
It is true that we did welcome even the acute, lawyer-like subtlety, which, by naming the slave the contraband of war, took him ingeniously from the grasp of the oppressor. We forgave the fallacy of the figure for its benevolent ingenuity, and the heart of the North warmed toward Butler for using the fine weapons of legal diplomacy on the side of humanity. All
<c02>
honor to Butler�for while he stooped to call the slave a thing, it was that he might use him as a man. He used the very terms of the Southern law which had stripped the negro of human personality, and recorded him a chattel to build a fortress of protection around him, under whose shadow his human rights might be once more restored; and thousands of liberated slaves will bless the name of Butler to their latest day; and when he comes to a dying hour, we question whether all military glory will weigh so much in his eyes as the thought of the human beings he has restored to liberty and manhood. But it is the noble prerogative of the military chieftain to declare law without subtlety or explanation. Fremont does not call the slave contraband of war. That position, advantageous and ingenious in its day, is now abandoned for higher vantage-ground. Fremont does not even speak of the slave as property: the property of traitors he declares confiscated, their slaves, if they have any free. There we have it, fair and square. Out goes his banner! down goes his glove! and if any one does not like it, let him try conclusions, sword with sword that is all!
Earth shall not look on a sublimer sight than the army of the South and West, with freedom to the slave on its banner, as it shall roll majestically down the Mississippi, with the prayers of the oppressed rising like many waters for its success, and the songs of redeemed ones wakening like birds as it passes.
The hereof the golden gate, who opened the doors of that splendid new California world, has long been predestined in the traditions of the slave as their coming liberator. �Fremont and liberty� are words that have been coupled in many a song before now, and Fremont has made good the augury. So far as we have seen and heard, this proclamation has met that universal response which the world always accords to a fitting deed done in the fullness of time.
We longed for a bold step we sighed for a victory and we have got it!
It was something to take the shores of North Carolina. Well and gallantly was it done. But this proclamation is a greater victory than that; it will carry with it a swing and impulse a moral force, which will be felt through all nations.
This will be a burning test of the sincerity of those in foreign lands who have said, All our sympathies are with this war when we shall see that it emancipates the slave. Let us see if it proves so. Let us see if they who carped at Butler, though he freed thousands, because he used the legal techniques of the slave-law to do it, will now respond to the open trumpet-call of Fremont declaring liberty at a breath to sixty thousand slaves!
Will they meet this great movement with generous sympathy or with unworthy detraction? To us, now, the question matters little to them a great deal. It will show to all the world what manner of spirit they are of!
Let us pray that this heroic declaration of Fremont's find its echo in the Eastern army. We have freed a great many slaves, and got very little credit for it we have freed them, as it were, under protest, by pretext, and by ingenious subtleties now, let us free them martially, and with the high hand.
We have had a good lawyer for them, now let us have a good general. The heart of the nation longs to hear in the East just such a trumpet-call as we have heard from the West. New York Independent.

FREMONT'S PEOCLAMATION.
We regard the proclamation of Gen. Fremont, by which sixty thousand chattels are virtually converted into freemen, of greater importance than the capture of the forts at Hatteras. It will strengthen our cause incalculably in Missouri, and commensurately weaken that of the enemy, besides creating much sympathy in our favor with the European powers. It is cheering to see that many Union men, who are slaveholders, highly commend the action, and are heartily sustaining it, not only in Missouri but in other States also. This corroborates a fact which has long since become apparent to all who have closely observed this movement, that those who are true Union men in the slave States, are generally men who have little relish for the institution of slavery, though many of them are slaveholders. Indeed, this war having originated, as all men both North and South know it did originate, for the aggrandizement of slavery, it could not be otherwise than that those who were fast friends of the institution should array themselves on the side of the rebellion.
It seems hardly possible that the predictions of some few should be correct, who prophecy that the administration will disallow of the proclamation. It is hardly a supposable case that our government will throw away the advantage this measure affords it in Missouri, and by so doing give aid and countenance to the rebels, and perhaps surrender that State into the hands of the South. Should the same course be pursued in the States of Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, Maryland and Virginia, it would save more blood and treasure than any other piece of policy which could be adopted, unless, perhaps, it might be that of liberating all the slaves, with the promise of remuneration to those loyal men who might lose on that account. Let either of these measures be adopted, and the troops of the Confederates could not be restrained in camp. All who own slave property would leave the army at once, to secure it. 
It is to be hoped that this policy will, sooner or later, be adopted by the Government. In spite of the timidity of a few of our time-serving contemporaries, such a measure would receive a hearty response from all true patriots of the North, and would show a commendable fearlessness on the part of our Government, which would be honorable among men and commendable in the eyes of God, and would awaken a new enthusiasm in the breasts of many in favor of the war, who now fear that nothing is to be gained to the cause of freedom or the permanent peace of the country, so long as the blows are not aimed at the real aggressor the institution of slavery.-Dover Morning Star.

APPROVAL OF FREMONT'S PROCLAMATION.
It has come. What? The beginning of the end. Read Fremont's proclamation, and ponder over the words,� The property, real and personal, of all persons in the State of Missouri who shall take up arms against the United States, and who shall be directly proven to have taken active part with their enemies in the field, is declared to be confiscated to the public use, and their slaves, if any they have, are hereby declared free." This is the utterance of no act of! Congress, but of the war power, of the power of self preservation. Think of the vast consequences locked up in these few words. They say that the administion is prepared to take� the bull by the horns," and throw him, if necessary, to save the country. This is no empty decree of emancipation, but an enunciation backed by the energy and military force of Gen. Fremont, so far as the State of Missouri is concerned. But it is the stretched-out forefinger of the administration to the rebellious States. It is a warning to slaveholders that if they will make slavery the cause for destroying the government, the cause will be removed, and they shall hold a barren sceptre in their grasp." It is one of the logical results to which Providence is fast bringing us by the exigencies of events. And, thank God! the people endorse it. All through the streets of conservative merchants, we hear, That's it; that's the way to do it; we've got them on the hip now." It makes one's heart glad to see the unanimity with which this act of Fremont is endorsed by all classes. Even clergy men who have taken a �South-side view of slavery� endorse it. Old commentators who have lost their sight in poring over ancient excursus on� Cursed be Canaan," endorse it. Men who have prayed for years for the slave, saying,� O, Lord, how long!" thank God and take courage. The administration may go ahead; the people will stand by them if they emancipate every slave in the land, provided they finish up the war and maintain an undivided country. Messieurs rebels of the South, our next weapon: is the formation of black regiments, wherewith to invade your sacred soil. Shall it be done? We know what it means, and so do you. We have counted the cost, and we will finish this war, if need be, by every weapon which God and nature place in our hands. Shall it be done? It is for you to say. May not our anti-slavery friends learn patience from this new illustration of the text,� Be still and see the salvation of the Lord?�-Army correspondent of the Watchman and Reflector.
PAINFUL, RUMOR, It has been currently rumored here for some days past, (says the Columbia Republican,) that Mr. Paul Coleman, formerly a resident of Greenport, and mare recently of Canaan, and well known to most of our citizens, was hung a few weeks since by the Rebels of Fairfax county, Virginia, where he has been living for some time past, for the crime of loyalty to the Constitution and the Union. Such is the" murderous spirit of the South!

The Liberator
No Union with Slaveholders!
BOSTON, FRIDAY, SEPT. 20, 1861.
THE GOVERNMENT SUBVERTING ITSELF.
Since the present civil war commenced by the traitors of the South, for the overthrow of the National Government and the subversion of all free institutions, nothing has transpired to give such heartfelt satisfaction and wide-spread enthusiasm as the Proclamation of Gen. Fremont, emancipating under martial law all the slaves belonging to the rebel slaveholders in Missouri. The act has been universally sustained by the press, without distinction of party-both the New York Herald and the Boston Post concurring in its necessity and importance. But, just as the public sentiment is reaching a white heat in its support, out comes a letter from President Lincoln to Gen. Fremont, virtually annulling the act aforesaid, by making it conform to the confiscation act adopted by Congress in August, which requires proof that slaves have been used to carry on the rebellion by their masters, before they can be set free! As if any other proof were needed, in such cases, than the fact that the slaves are held as property that they cannot and do not act contrary to the wishes of those who exercise over them unlimited despotic power and that it is all the same whether they are forced to dig trenches, raise embankments, construct barricades, bear arms, or work in the field to produce the food necessary to keep the rebels alive! To all intents and purposes, they are compelled to do all in their power in support of the bastard government of the Confederate States, and consequently, to the overthrow of the National Government. An involuntary rebel slave, with his shovel and hoe, is almost as formidable as his rebel owner with his sword and gun. Until he obtains his freedom under the national flag, he cannot be otherwise than a tool for the furtherance of the designs of the enemy. Hence, nothing more is needed to be known to justify his transformation into a freeman, than that he belongs to a traitor. Instead, therefore, of President Lincoln attempting to annul or modify Gen. Fremont's wise, beneficent and masterly procedure in this respect, he is to be regarded as guilty of a serious dereliction of duty in not making it applicable to all the other slave States in revolt. Of his rightful power to do this, there is none so bold or foolish as to deny it. In his great speech in the U. S. House of Representatives in 1842, John Quincy Adams said, while treating upon the war power:�
"I lay this down as the law of nations. I say that the military authority takes, for the time, the place of all municipal institutions, slavery among the rest. Under that state of things, so far from its being true that the States where slavery exists have the exclusive management of the subject, not only the President of the United States, but the commander of the army , has power to order the universal emancipation of the slaves."
If, then, to preserve the government, in case of foreign invasion, �the universal emancipation of the slaves� may be proclaimed,� not only by the President of the United States, but by the commander of the army," how much more justifiably in case of a civil war, waged by the great body of the slaveholders themselves, for the most treasonable purpose! 
We do not see how the act of Congress, referred to by the President, is applicable to the state of things in Missouri. It is clearly outside of martial law, which, being proclaimed by Gen. Fremont as a necessity in that State, takes precedence of that act, not counteracting any of its provisions, but making it more stringent, in order that the rebellion may be put down, and the authority of the Government vindicated.
To all those who are wilfully blind, there are five propositions manifestly plain:�1. That slavery is the sole cause of the present struggle which rends asunder the nation. 2. That its extinction is essential to the triumph of the government, and the perpetuation of an all-embracing Union of the States. 3. That not to strike at its existence, boldly and uncompromisingly, is to play into the hands of the secessionists, and to give them �aid and comfort." 4. That, by striking an effectual blow in that direction, without delay, the war will be speedily terminated, and the root of national disunion extracted. Hence, 5. That, so long as the government refuses to do this, it is playing fast-and-loose with Southern treason and traitors Pulling down with one hand what it seeks to build up with the other daubing with untempered mortar, attempting to draw out leviathan with a hook, and seeking to drain the ocean with a sieve. It is time for such folly and fatuity to end. Either the government must abolish slavery, or the independence of the Southern Confederacy must be recognized. A reunion upon the old basis is alike undesirable and impossible. 
It is too early to know what will be the effect of this untimely and unwise interposition of the President; but that it will have a damaging effect upon the cause of the government, by depressing the moral sentiment and popular enthusiasm inspired by Gen. Fremont's proclamation, cannot be reasonably doubted. It may gratify the malignant prejudices of the base despisers and vulgar enemies of the colored race, but it will not in the slightest degree appease the spirit of treason in the land, whether veiled at the North, or half or wholly revealed at the South. It will serve to subvert rather than to sustain the government; it will needlessly prolong a fierce and sanguinary conflict, and add greatly to the number of the slain and the expenses of the war; it will discourage the true friends of freedom, and encourage its bitterest foes. Even the Baltimore Patriot has the manliness to say:-
"We have had enough of attempts to soothe, to conciliate, and compromise with traitors bearing arms in their hands; and we know what we have suffered there from. THEY MUST BE PUT DOWS. We rejoice at and heartily approve of Gen. Fremont's action."
And the Cincinnati Commercial significantly adds:�
"The men from whom we have heard the loudest praises of the Fremont proclamation are Democrats and Kentuckians. They say it is all right. It don't free anybody�s negroes but traitors; and are we to suppose that a General is to take care of an enemy's negroes for him? Gen. Fremont has simply refused to enter into� the negro trade. As the shortest way of managing contraband negroes, he turns them loose to shift for themselves. He don't undertake to sell them for the benefit of the United States, or to feed them at the expense of the government. If this is radical, it is a case of radical common sense."
Once more to quote John Quincy Adams:-
"If civil war come, if insurrection come, is this beleaguered capital, is this besieged government to see millions of its subjects in arms, and have no right to break the fetters which they are forging into swords? No! The war power of the government can sweep this institution into the Gulf."
Well, the time has come when� civil war" rages when� the capital is beleaguered" to its imminent peril by a legion of deadly foes, when the government is� besieged� for its utter overthrow by a piratical slave oligarchy; and yet neither the President nor the Commander-in-chief of the army is disposed to strike the only blow necessary to save the republic and suppress a most desperate and bloody rebellion Are they not deserving of impeachment?
Now see what is the temper of the traitors! Take the following item from the Richmond Whig:-
WON'T BE RECOGNIZED. It is thought that no exchange of prisoners may be effected without recognizing the Southern Confederacy. Cuss your recognition! We don't want it, and won't have it. You may hang away as fast as you please we have a goodly number of Yankees here, who will grace the gallows as well as another! But don't distress yourself about recognition. We will recognize you with a vengeance on the banks of the Delaware and Hudson, before many moons have waned.
The New Orleans Delta says" No mediation of any Power on earth will be entertained by the South, which looks to a reconstruction of the government as it existed on the 4th day of November last," and no scheme of any party or faction in the North �can ever again bring together the broken fragments of the once powerful United States." Enough!

"The troubles in which we now are, are the results of concessions in matters of principle, which should have been settled by the infinite standard of right, and by the great law of God. We had a monster in our midst, and we thought the best way to manage an him was to feed him, pat him, and let him have his own way. So every time he roared, we threw him a bone to still him, and all the time he was growing strong. When we saw his glaring eyes, we threw him the Missouri Compromise, and still he grew,. When he growled, we threw down before him the Fugitive Slave Law, and yet he grew. When he became more terrible, we fixed the Kansas-Nebraska bill to please him; and when we had nothing more to cast to him, this monster, whom we had fondled and fed, came upon us and tore our flag to pieces, trampled our Constitution in the dust, repudiated honest contracts, and, seizing with his infernal claws the pillars of the fabric of our freedom, endeavored to pull the whole structure down into one common ruin. That monster is Slavery a system which has been the cause of our alienations, the source of our misunderstandings, and the plague of our nation from the time its corner-stone was laid. Some men seem to have an evil genius a bad angel, that moves them to evil, that sweeps away their good intentions, that spoils every honest endeavor, and destroys them in spite of themselves. Slavery has been the evil genius of our nation; the blot on our liberty; the stain on our banner; the millstone in our ascent to a glorious destiny. And yet the legislation of our country, for half a century, has been little more than a series of compromises with this, evil spirit, and the result we have in the ruin and disgrace which stare us in the face to-day.
And yet we shall hear of compromise again ere long; the old cheat is not yet dead, and the moment the enthusiasm of victory is over, men will begin to yield.� Feed the monster," they will begin to say. �Throw him a few more bones; let him grow a little; give him more life." Politicians, who want something upon which to climb into office; business men, who feel the pressure of these evil times; quiet citizens, who are tired of war, and mistaken theorizers, who really think slavery a source of national strength, will begin to cry" Feed the monster; let him live, though he has taught our senators treason, and shed the blood of our soldiers let him live."
But, unless we find some means to ensure the peaceful, constitutional, honest extinction of slavery, we keep the cause of all our woes. Settle this evil war by compromise, and it will not be ten years before this scene will be repeated, even if the breach be now healed. It will not be ten years before slavery will let loose upon us a new tide of blood.
The victory we need to gain is not simply to crush out the spirit of rebellion, to set up the flag over the bastions of a dismantled Sumter, and drive traitors out of Richmond and Charleston! Do all that, mend the breach, heal the divisions, bind up the wounds, present to the world an unstained flag and an undivided nationality, and if slavery has not received its death-blow, you are a vanquished people; the precious blood you have shed has been spilt in vain; the brave men who have lost their lives have been thrown away; the millions of money you have expended will be worse than squandered, and you will come out of the battle with the heel of the monster on your neck.
And what is there about slavery that any man in the North should want to keep it? Has it not corrupted your public men, perjured your judges and senators, plundered your treasury, murdered your citizens, soiled your flag, trampled on your Constitution, perverted your history, and sown your fields with blood! Has it not done all this, and more than this? And can you afford to give it a new lease of life, even though you pacify it now? Do you dare to lengthen its cords, and allow it to gather strength, that it may rise again in four, eight, or twelve years, anew to plunder your national treasury, destroy your national honor and credit, blast your business and prosperity, butcher your wives and children, and again overflow your land with blood? Why, how many civil wars can America stand? How often can it go through periods like this, without having its life quenched in blackness and blood? Let your government enter into any compromise that will strengthen the hands of slavery, and you rush upon your doom. You take up a controversy with the religion of the Bible, and the conscience of the whole civilized world. You go with your eyes open, into a hopeless war with omnipotent God.
Why, what is God teaching us now? Don't you hear his voice? From Sumter's dismantled bastions don't you hear it?" Let the oppressed go free." From the blood-wet pavements of Baltimore don't you hear it?-�Let the oppressed go free." From the fearful slaughter of Bull Run, from that brave day that mysteriously lapsed into panic and fright, don't you hear it?" Let the oppressed go free." From victory and defeat, from the beleagured and the murderous charge, don't you hear it?-"Let the oppressed go free." Every slave that comes to us, saying,� Knock off these chains," is a plea from God. Every drop of blood shed, and every unburied body left on Southern fields, is a heaven-high demand for the extinction of slavery.
I say, then, that compromise with slavery is a mad, ruinous, hopeless method of settlement. You who urge it are the scribes who would write in gore the doom of American liberty, and quench every star that now shines in the horizon of our country's future."

A VALUABLE BOOK.
From the hand of the Publisher, my esteemed friend, R. F. Wallcut, I have received a faithful and timely expose of the pro-slavery wickedness of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, by CHAS. K. WHIPPLE.
This is a closely printed volume of 247 pages, abounding in copious extracts from official records. The industry and faithfulness of the author will not fail to commend itself, especially to all who love the Anti-Slavery cause, and to every candid mind. It is a sad mirror for those to look into who are in fellowship with the Board of Commissioners. The colossal guilt of this pampered and overgrown society stands out in bold relief. And the worst of all is, that out of their own mouths they stand condemned. If any one has ever had the shadow of a doubt of their guilt by a complicity with the sin of slavery, that doubt will be forever removed, by an examination of Mr. Whipple's work. The heart of the reader will not fail to be moved with a righteous indignation at the hypocrisy of such a �Board," presuming to teach the heathen the way of Christian duty; and the honest soul must inwardly exclaim,� Better that my money be cast in mid-ocean, than a single cent find its way into hands red with the blood of enslaved millions."
But with this awful revelation, so potent to the world, thousands are annually paying tribute to this wicked� Board," flattered with the idea that such an offering is acceptable to God! Let all such persons lay no such flattering unction to their soul. God is not mocked. The accursed wrong thus winked at will one day be revealed; and when the cry goes forth,� Where is thy brother?� it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah, than for the� American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions."
Most thankful do I feel to our indefatigable brother Whipple, for his valuable labor in giving this work to the public; and I am sure no Anti-Slavery man or woman will fail to have on the table this potent weapon, to parry off every canting appeal for money to save the heathen, through such an ally. Circulate this work: let it go forth to open the eyes of many blinded by interested zealots, of whom it may be said, in their present wicked position, �I know you; ye have not the love of God in your hearts."

GENERAL T. PERRONET THOMPSON.
84 Newington Crescent, Kennington Road, LONDON, August 27, 1861. 
MY DEAR SIR,-My friend, Gen. Perronet Thompson, informs me that, although personally unacquainted with you, he has addressed you a letter and enclosed several communications from his pen, on the subject of the civil war in America in its relation to the slavery question, which have been published in various English journals. He has expressed a desire that, when I wrote to you, I would mention who he was, as an additional introduction to yourself and your fellow laborers in the cause of emancipation. This, however, is, I think, scarcely necessary. You certainly must be familiar with the name of Perronet Thompson as� a household word,"-a name which must be precious to the friends of humanity and the oppressed, for all time. Considerably more than fifty years have elapsed since General Thompson was recalled from the Governorship of Sierra Leone, for his activity in adopting measures for the suppression of the slave trade;-so that he was an early sufferer, as well as laborer, in the anti-slavery movement. At a later period he was, I. believe, the first man to conclude a treaty with the Arabs of the sea-coast, for the abolition of the slave trade in the Gulf of Persia. As one of the founders of the Westminster Review, and a most terse and vigorous writer, as well as speaker, he rendered substantial service to. the cause of West India Emancipation. No man of whom I possess any acquaintance, has more consistently devoted his great powers to the benefit of his species. He was the author of the� Catechism of the Corn Laws," the publication of which long preceded the organized agitation for free trade, and did much to prepare the way for one of the sublimest events of English history. His scathing exposure of the cruelty and injustice of England's policy towards native races, with especial reference to the Indian rebellion and the war with China, cost him his seat as member for Bradford. So that you have in him, I think, a perfectly clean-handed abolitionist,-a man who, as he spares not the crimes of his own country, is peculiarly entitled to extend the sphere of his philanthropic labors to other parts of the world. I can testify to the deep and unceasing interest he has taken in the American question. No one man has done more than he to enlighten the English public as to the real nature of the struggle which has now divided your great country into two hostile camps. No man has, with greater persistency or more intense faith, endeavored to imbue the popular mind with the conviction that, despite the examples of Northern subservience to Southern ideas of property.-with which all England was shocked, and which did more than anything else to alienate foreign sympathy from the Federal cause,-the true apostolic successors of �Washington, the honest representatives of American republicanism would sooner or later gain the upper hand, and make the war one not only for the suppression of rebellion, but for the extirpation of the system which has borne such bitter and monstrous fruits. You have, therefore, in General Thompson, a true friend and co-worker, one steadfast in adversity,� faithful among the faithless found." He and all unofficial, undiplomatic men like him, are well fitted to preserve the entente cordiale between England and a free North, or, better still, a free and emancipated America. Meanwhile, believe me that, however cold you may think the English people at the present moment, the instant your President and commander-in-chief inscribes� Emancipation� on the Federal banner, that coldness will give place to a warmth and enthusiasm in favor of your cause which will prove to you that, while we cannot sympathize with a mere war of domination, we can heartily wish� God speed� to a war for the freedom of four millions of the human race.
Our first of August meeting, this year, was all that we could have desired-the speeches being thoroughly up to the mark, and the audience large and enthusiastic.
With true respect, I remain,
Very truly, yours,
F. W. CHESSON.

THE DECISIVE COUP D'ETAT.
The actual problem now undergoing solution among us as a nation is the same that has been traversing its various stages of process for many years. Heretofore, it has been proceeding politically, and at times socially. In politics, different phases have appeared at different seasons; pro-slavery continually becoming more stringent in its demands, till it finally reached a pitch which, if carried out according to its tendency, would introduce slaves, temporarily at first, all over the Union, and then permanently wherever its advocates deemed them profitable, and for its interest, to be established, regardless of its injury to others, and of their right to protest against it. In the social sphere, discussion of the subject in its numerous bearings was not to be tolerated; but, submission was required. Certain citizens were not safe in certain parts of the nation, and were watched, in their deeds and words, as pickpockets are watched by an efficient police.
The problem is, shall we have a free or a slave Republic? If the latter, the predominant influence will be against freedom. One section will have powers not enjoyed by the other; and there will be inequality. The standard of everything will be slavery. If the former, all can enjoy equal privileges, and the standard will be freedom to each and every one, and equality to each and every one, in the nation. There will be no sectional collision, nor any occasion for such. Peace and prosperity, unity and happiness, valuable desiderata, will be the result. What will be the state of things, if the contrary prevail, our present unfortunate condition declares to us. Discord, enmity, and war are its concomitant and disastrous consequences.
What we experience now will continue constantly or at intervals, so long as its cause exists; and the present predicament of our country demonstrates it to the satisfaction of every unprejudiced mind. Indeed, no other charge is preferred by the South than that they cannot do with their slaves as they please, not withstanding the wishes and views of others opposed to them. Their asserted rights ignore and deny the existence of any opposite rights, and the right of any body to dispute or to oppose theirs.
From a social and a political sphere, they have seen fit to transfer the process of solution to the battle-field. They have inaugurated a war. They have appealed to arms. Their previous tactics were demands; now, they employ force. The conflict has been waging for months, and we seem no nearer to an end of fighting than before. Skirmishes and stratagems are continued with tedious prolixity. Instead of being dislodged from their position, their martial numbers have increased. The conflagration has spread; and it assumes interminability. This course deranges and exhausts the people.
What should be done? President Davis orders all friends of the Union away, at forty days' notice. By that act, he has given our government his own authority to notify him and his fellow rebels to quit Virginia and other States belonging to the Union. If they refuse, he adds the authority to our President to impose on them a penalty, and as a matter of courtesy, if he be pleased to extend such leniency, to notify them of the nature of the penalty, viz., that unless they lay down their arms and depart, he shall liberate their slaves. If they still persist, he can then notify all the women and children and all Union men in the South, that he is about to proclaim emancipation at such a time, and advise them to leave that region before the stated time. Let him then act as he promises, by issuing his proclamation; and if that coup d' that do not give the rebels enough work to employ themselves at home, if it do not compel their departure and a disbandment of the army, no harm is done except the inauguration of a free Republic. To pay the Union men the full value of their slaves liberated would require much less money, toil, and violent death, than a continuation of the contest will require; and it would effect a permanent settlement of difficulties, which, it is by no means certain, the contest will do. Is it not
<c06>
a duty due from the government to the people, to practise economy in all our national interest? Life, liberty, happiness, property, business, are all at stake; and all are now deeply suffering. Let the practice of administrative economy retrench, aye, end this public and private suffering. One legitimate act energetically applied is worth more than all the successful battle fields within our reach. Diplomatic or military temporizing is unequal to the quelling of tyrannical rebellion.
The professed object of the volunteer soldiery is not pecuniary reward, nor promotion, nor fame for the officers, nor discomfort, nor death; but, to secure the permanent integrity of the Union. They can have no pleasure in incurring a needless risk of life and health, undergoing the privations of home and business, nor any desire to perpetuate the cause of rebellion. They cannot therefore wish for a continuance of slavery, which is the cause. What then? The sooner that object is attained, the sooner they will be released from martial discipline and toil, the sooner they will escape the risk of loss of life, limb, and health and the sooner will they return home in safety. It is then natural to suppose they will coincide with that course of action, which will produce the desired result in the most speedy and permanent manner. They know that the rebels have really forfeited all title to their property by the violent assault upon public property, and upon the structure of our government; all title to our soldiery's respect by the insolent calumnies and insults they have uttered against all representatives of free labor; and all title to protection by their endeavoring to undermine the national protection. What sympathy, therefore, can the rank and file of the patriotic military have for the rebel, or for the security of his property, be it slave or cotton field? Their very volunteering in such immense numbers declares them loyal men, and not ready to breath an objection to uphold the rebellion. They could not and would not breathe an objection to an emancipation so decisive in its effect, so abundantly warranted by the rebels' course, and so clearly demanded and authorized by the exigency. Such policy would produce no disaffection in the army.
Try then the decisive coup d'etat. Were it in their power, they would not hesitate to try it upon us. They have already done more than that. Under the present circumstances, the whole Union will say Amen, and all posterity will pronounce it a blessing, an act of justice, and its author a benefactor; nor will the noble deed of FREMONT, or the generous sentiments of BURLER,-both indicating the military pulse,-ever be forgotten by the tenacious memory of history.

�WATCEMAN, WHAT OF THE NIGHT?�
The War as an Anti-Slavery Educational Instrumentality. Slavery or the Government will be Abolished. Which must it be?
LIVONIA, (Mich.,) Sept. 5, 1861.
WM. LLOYD GARRISON:
DEAR FRIEND-You stands on the watch-tower of our Anti-Slavery Zion. Allow me to ask, �Watch-man! What of the night?� Can you say, �The day cometh?-the day of deliverance to the captive"? Do you see in this horrible war, liberty for the slave? I DO. Why? How? 
I ask-Who are the combatants? Not the enslavers and enslaved-but the conflict is solely between the enslavers themselves. Hitherto, slavery has ruled the nation, solely through the North cooperating with them in the Federal Government. The North was not willing to do all the South wished, and the slaveholders have waged against the North a malignant war, to compel them to do their bidding, and to demolish their National Edifice, if they refuse. Though the cause of the war, the slave is allowed, as yet, to take no part in it, with a view to his own deliverance. But is it possible for the enslavers thus to war among themselves without its resulting for liberty, and against slavery? No. Every day this war continues, and every battle fought, whoever wins, the power of the oppressor is diminished.
What effect has the war upon the slave? It deepens his desire for freedom, intensifies his hatred of slavery, diminishes his servile dread of his enslavers, buoys him up with the hope that the day of his redemption is near, and helps to vitalize and energize his whole being, and make him feel that he is a man, and not a chattel. Even when compelled to fight for his en-slavers, to build their forts and man their batteries, the slave is finding his manhood, and acquiring the will, the skill, and the power to assert it. Into which ever camp the slave is brought, he is being taught the lesson that resistance to his enslavers is obedience to God, and that slaveholders have no rights which he is bound to respect, and that slaves owe no duties to their enslavers. This war is rapidly educating and preparing the slave for freedom,-more rapidly than millions of compromising teachers, priests and politicians could do. A bloody, relentless war among the enslavers is a most efficient and mighty educational power to prepare the slave to strike for his freedom. I give it not as an argument in fever of war, but state it as a fact, which, though not a result intended by the belligerents, at least on one side, must as necessarily follow as strength and skill of muscle follow its exercise. No argument can reconcile war with justice and humanity. But nearly universal Christendom recognizes bullets and bayonets as just and Christian means to resist all piratical enslavers of men and women. The South slaughter men and women to spread an perpetuate slavery. Every blow struck against the slaveholder by the North must tell against slavery, the one object for which the South fights. Whoever wins, the condition of the slave will be improved. He is nearer his final redemption.
Then, the influence of the war upon the. North. It is all but a universal feeling at the North that slavery is the sole cause of the war. Every ship taken by the pirates, every battle fought, every arsenal, fort, custom-house, post-office or mint plundered or stolen-every debt and bond repudiated by them, every man and woman whipped, outraged, tarred and feathered, imprisoned or hung by them, but deepens and strengthens the anti-slavery sentiment of the North. The bullets that sent death to the hearts of Ellsworth and Lyon, sent Anti-Slavery-Abolition, to the hearts of thousands at the North. The feeling against slavery was never so intense and so wide-spread in the non-slaveholding States as at this hour. As the sole cause of the evils that are upon us, slavery was never so hated as now. As fast and as clearly as it is seen and felt that slavery is the cause of our national affliction, so intensely and practically will it be hated by the North, and its abolition be imperatively and unconditionally demanded.
The abolition of the Federal Government is essential to the propagation and perpetuation of slavery. So says the South. So the man-stealing, man-imbruting, woman-whipping, cradle-plundering Confederacy have decreed. This end they are seeking to accomplish.
The abolition of slavery is essential to the support and perpetuity of the National Government as a means to secure the blessings of liberty. Does the North see this? If not now, they soon must. SLAVERY OR THE GOVERNMENT MUST BE ABOLISHED. Every day the war continues, every battle and skirmish, only deepens and intensifies this conviction.
No event of the war seems so satisfactory to the masses, and thrills their hearts with more hope and joy, than the Proclamation of Fremont, published last Saturday, Aug. 31st, .declaring that� the slaves of all rebels and their abettors in Missouri are free men.� What can be done to carry this news, instantly, to the slaves of the Missouri rebels? Who will carry it to them? Who will say-�Here am I, God of Liberty, send me?� Who will go anyhow, whether sent or not? What can be done to get Butler and McClellan to issue this decree in their districts? What to get Lincoln and Scott to proclaim freedom to every slave in every revolted State? 
Yours, HENRY C. WRIGHT.
P. S. Dear Garrison. I left Boston Monday, Aug. 12th; was at a Convention in Omega three days-the discussion turning on our duties under the present

criss of the nation. I then visited Chenango and Otsego counties, and held many conversations in private circles; and in these once strong holds of pro-slavery Democracy, but few are found to side with the pirates, and those few are rapidly being silenced. There is a lord call for a law to suppress all papers and assemblies in the interests of the pirates. It is felt that their advocates and apologists in the North are more dangerous to liberty and free institutions than the pirates themselves. This has ever been true. The Northern apologists, in Church and State, of Southern marauders and pirates, have been more dangerous to the cause of freedom and free institutions, than the most rampant braggadocios among Southern kidnappers.
Sunday, Aug. 25th.-I lectured three times in West Winfield, Herkimer Co., N. Y. The Greens, the Eatons, the Backuses, the Browns, and other true friends of freedom in that place, see and feel that slavery is the sole cause of the war, and they are laboring efficiently to get, all around them to see and feel the same. God speed them! say Ifor as the North feels this, will all the people demand its abolition as the only way to preserve their National Government as a means of securing the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity.
Sunday, Sept. 1st.-I lectured twice in Farmington, Michigan, and last evening, the 10th, in this place. My theme isThe Cause and the Cure of the Evils that are upon us. The abolition of slavery the only means to preserve and perpetuate the institutions of freedom. Shall Slavery or Liberty rule the continent? These are my subjects. Never were so many prepared to give them an impartial hearing. They are momentous as lifewhile men seek to human governments for protection and for morality, as this nation and all Christendom do. GOD, as a governing power over man in every-day life, is ignored by Church and State; the dominion of man over man, sustained by bullets and bayonets, is their standard of duty, and the measure of protection.
Wonderful is the change going on in the public mind. There are some who are seeking to compel the North to submit to all the demands of the pirates; for well they know that their party can never again come into power but through their votes. So they try to get the North to yield. But, Slavery has lost its power forever over the Northern mind. It can never be where it was one year or six months ago. God speed the right! H. C. W.

A VISIT FROM HENRY C. WRIGHT.
LIVONIA, Mich., Sept. 5, 1861. 
EDITOR LIBERATOR,We have lately been favored with a visit from Henry C. Wright; and it occurs to me that a brief account of his labors in this vicinity, and of the state of public sentiment here on the great issues now before the people, may not be entirely uninteresting to the readers of the Liberator. The subject upon which he addressed the people here last evening was, "The war, or the cause and cure of the present crisis in America." He proceeded, briefly but clearly, to show that slavery was the cause of the present war; that the slaveholders, failing to secure the perpetuity and ultimate universality of their institution, under the government, had (seizing upon the incident of the election of Abraham Lincoln as a favorable opportunity) attempted to overthrow the government;-that the stake for which they played was the ultimate universal reign of slavery in this nation, failing of which, liberty must ruleas the two principles, being directly antagonistic, could not exist in co-partnership;-that this rebellion had been the deliberate design of leading Southern politicians for the last thirty years; and finally, that the only way of securing permanent peace was by the ABOLITION OF THE CAUSE OF THE WAR-American slavery.
He held that our government was originally organized upon the idea of liberty, and that however wide its administration may have been of the true intent of its framers, it, and the flag which represents it, were symbols of liberty,-particularly as opposed to the traitorous, piratical, slaveholding oligarchy, represented by the stars and bars, and the fundamental law of the C. S. A.; and that it was the manifest duty of every true lover of liberty to stand by the old flag and the government, and to strengthen the hands of the administration in this conflict with the Slave Power, which must ultimately result in the breaking of the slave's fetters.
He demonstrated that the rebels had fortified all constitutional rights, and claimed that he who talked of our constitutional obligations to traitors with arms in their hands, was himself a traitor and a spy in our camp. He declared it to be the duty of our government to confiscate all rebel property, and proclaim every slave free, as a measure of common defence and retributive justice, as had Gen. Fremont in Missouri, and expressed his belief that this was the intention of the Executive, as manifested by the initiatory step of Fremont.
The lecture was a manly and forcible exposition of the convictions of one who has grown old in a war of ideas for liberty, and was attentively listened to and applauded by an intelligent and appreciative audience. Public opinion here is rapidly coming to the point of universal emancipation, and such lectures are productive of a vast amount of good in provoking discussion and in eliciting an expression, of the anti-slavery proclivities of an overwhelming majority of the people. It seems to me that now is no time to stand upon niceties of opinion, but rather to seize upon the present opportunity to deal our heartiest blows against our common enemy, the Slave Power, leaving to some future time, when we have more leisure, the adjustment of delicate constitutional questions; and I apprehend that no anti-slavery man can engage in a better work than teaching the lesson, that resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, either by his tongue, his pen, or his own RIGHT ARM.
Hastily, yours, R. L. ALEXANDER.

TO A. HOGEBOOM.
I see in the Liberator of September 13, a communication addressed by you to me, which you commence by saying that I "propose a compromise for the Government and its rebels." I propose no such thing: no person is more averse than I am to any compromise with a community of barbarians, who have made such outrageous violations of all justice and humanity as the secessionists of the South; and there is not one of the compromises which were offered to them the last winter, even by leading Republicans, to which I would have assented. It is true, I do propose "an acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the revolted section"; but this is only admitting that to be a fact, which all the world sees to be a fact. The government of the Southern Confederacy is as thoroughly organized, as unresisted at home, and as uncontrolled by the Federal Government, as are the Republics of Mexico or Hayti; and that it may be brought into the Union at the end of the war, (if the war ever ends,) does not disprove its independence now. The irrational denial of the fact of this independence by our Government, and by the people of the North, will be a subject of ridicule in a future less infatuated age. Clearly, such an acknowledgment of a truth would be no compromise.
But you further say, that this "acknowledgment" by me is to be on condition that travel, residence, domestic and social engagements, commercial transactions, and the exercise of speech, writing and printing, shall "be free to the citizens of each republic." It is true I propose these conditions, but these are not all; and your subsequent argument, founded on the implication that these are all I ask, misrepresents me, and misleads your readers. In the plan I have proposed, I would not only insist on these conditions, but I would so hem in the slave States by the Northern Republic, that the further extension of slavery should be made impossible, and that the free States should be exempted from the obligation to return fugitive slaves, or any other measure by which slavery should be promoted, or its rightfulness admitted. Such conditions, instead of being a compromise favorable to the South,
<c02>
would be a stipulation of advantages to the free States they have never yet claimed.
You consider such a plan a "vagary": to me, it is the only possible or desirable result of this war; and so great a curse do I deem our union with the slave-holding States, that, if they would not consent to the conditions we should impose on separation, I would compel them to do soa task much easier performed than the attempt to force them into the Union by war. It is true that separation will not effect the immediate emancipation of the slaves; but it is certain to do so ultimatelya result which never can be accomplished by war, while the restoration of the Union is insisted on; and the forcible emancipation of the slaves, without consent of the masters, can only be achieved by the extermination of the whites of the South, the desolation of their country, and the burial of all the liberty of the nation under the charge of a military despotism.

THE NATIONAL FAST.
To the Reverend Clergy of the United States:
This, the memorial and petition of the undersigned, doth most respectfully set forth, and most earnestly and affectionately ask, as follows:
1. Our beloved Chief Magistrate, in accordance with a recommendation of Congress, has, as we are all aware, appointed a day of humiliation, prayer, and fasting.
2. The 58th chapter of Isaiah, as every diligent Bible reader is aware, describes very clearly the kind of fast which alone is acceptable to the Lord.
3. Permit me now to ask of you that, in your clerical ministrations on that day, you read the above named chapter as a scripture lesson.
4. And in your addresses on that day, will you not instruct your auditors, in accordance with the teachings of the chapter above referred to, that, for those in authority, and for those holding the rights of others in their hands, the proper style of fasting is, "to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free," &c.; and that for those not belonging to either of these classes, the proper course is to deal bread to the hungry, to clothe those who suffer for lack of clothing, to invite the homeless to their houses, &.c.?
5. Also in your prayers on that occasion, will you please heed the scripture injunction, to "remember them that are in bonds as bound with them"; and will you not also enforce upon your hearers the propriety and duty of endeavoring, in thought and in feeling, to make the case of the bondmen and bondwomen of our country their own? And, especially, in reference to such of these as manifestly are sincere Christians, will you not show what can be so easily shown, that to their case applies the principle so clearly announced by the Savior in Matthew 25th, that whatever is done or not done by us "to one of the least" of His "brethren," is accounted by Him as being done or not done to Himself?
6. And, finally, in view of the foregoing, will you not pray, and pray fervently, not only that war may soon cease in our nation, but also that, by some suitable means, this most flagrant of human oppressions, chattel slavery, may speedily come to an end?
7."And your memorialist and petitioner, as in duty bound, will," with divine assistance, faithfully perform his part of the duty herein asked to be done, whether this appeal shall be heeded or not.

VOICES OF THE PEOPLE.
"Proclaim liberty throughout the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof."
It seems as though the time had fully arrived for our Government to give heed to this very emphatic command, and break every yoke, that the oppressed may go free. Until this is done, we are fighting in vain, and never can conquer while we assist to hold four millions of our brothers and sisters in a bondage," , "one hour of which is fraught with more misery than ages of that which our fathers rose in rebellion to oppose." Let us, then, instead of stopping to observe hypocritical fasts, go to work, get petitions in circulation, giving every man, yea, and every woman too, a chance to bear their testimony against this whole system, now seeking by violence and blood to blot us out forever as a free people. Let the united voices of the freemen of the North proclaim, in tones not to be mistaken, that liberty is the birthright of all. Let us give expression to
"The voice of Massachusettsof her free sons and daughters;
Deep calling unto deep aloudthe sound of many waters;
Against the burden of that voice what tyrant power shall stand?
No fetters where our flag doth floatno slave throughout our land."
Feltonville, Sept 12, 1861. H.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 14. An unfortunate accident occurred at Wheatley's Theatre this evening, by the dress of one of the ballet girls catching fire in the dressing-room. Miss C. Gale, Miss Herman and several of the ballet girls were badly burned. The disaster created some alarm among the audience, but all were dismissed without accident. No damage was done to the theatre.
It appears that Miss Cecilia Gale, one of four talented and handsome sisters, was about robing herself in ballet costumes. She stood upon a settee to reach her dress, and somehow flirted it into a jet of gas, when it was instantly ignited. Before the young lady could recover from her fright, her clothes were all ablaze, and her sisters and several of the ballet girls from an adjoining dressing-room, rushing up to assist her, were in turn set on fire. About a dozen of these helpless girls were thus burning at once, and the fire run over their gauze and among their underclothes, making fast to their close leggins of "tights," and literally burning to the bone. Their screams were thrilling; and no scene of horrors that the stage ever witnessed may be compared to the terrible picture behind the scenes, where the fire from the burning dresses blazed up to the ceiling, and singed the lashes and hair of the affrighted women.
Miss Cecilia Gale, writhing and still in flames, darted down the stairs as stated, and was caught by Mr. Bayard, a stage carpenter, who at once tore up the sea cloth, (a sheet of canvass used to make waves,) and wrapped it around her. He was much burned while doing this. The young lady was removed to the hospital soon afterwards.
Several girls leaped into the street, through the second story windows, and Miss Hannah Gale, already badly burned, fell upon the pavement, bruising her back and head so that her case is considered hopeless. 
Miss Phoebe Norden, of Bristol, Penn., inhaled the flames, and was shockingly burned. She was at the point of death last evening.
Miss Annie Phillips died on Sunday morning.
Miss Anna McBride was burned in the breast, arms and legs, and taken to the Pennsylvania Hospital. She suffered the most excruciating pain during Saturday night, but towards morning her delirium abated and she died in the arms of Mrs. Wheatley.
Miss Annie Nichols was somewhat burned, but in the panic which ensued after the accident, she jumped from the head of the flies to the stagetwenty-five feetand breaking through a lot of mirrors and plate glass used to represent a lake, her hands and cheeks were lacerated.
Ruth and Adeline Gale were burned in the hands and breast,
Mrs. Mary E. Herman suffered exceedingly. 
Abby Carr, Margaret Conaway, Thomas Bayard Kate Harrison, and a young man, name unknown, were more or less badly burned. The last named in haled the fire, and his lungs have since been bleeding. 
Three of these people, it is believed, will die, and all will linger in acute pain for daysperhaps weeks and months.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept 15. Hannah and Zela Gale, and Misses Phillips, McBridge and Forden, who were burned at Wheatley's Continental Theatre last night, died to-day. Three more will probably die. Miss Annie Nichols, who leaped from the flies, is unharmed Abbie Carr, reported dead, is likely to recover. 
The American Tract Society of Boston has issued a tract from the pen of Rev. Dr. Wayland in reference to the coming national fast day. It designates some of our national errors and sins, specifying practical atheism, reliance upon, mere intellectual education to the neglect of moral and religious training recklessness in the choice of officers, devotion to money, indulgence of sensual appetites, and worldliness in the church. What! no allusion to, no condemnation of our great crowning national iniquity, slavery!

LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT TO GENERAL FREMONT.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14. The following letter from President Lincoln to Major General Fremont, was transmitted to the latter on the 12th inst.:-
WASHINGTON, D. C., Sept. 11,1861. 

Major General Fremont:
SIR,-Yours of the 8th, in answer to mine of the 2d inst, is just received. Assuming that you upon the ground could better judge of the necessities of your position than I could at this distance, on seeing your proclamation of August 30th, I perceived no general objection to it. The particular clause, however, in relation to the confiscation of property and the liberation of slaves, appeared to me to be objectionable in its non-conformity to the act of Congress, passed the 6th of last August, upon the same subjects, and hence I wrote you expressing my wish that that clause should be modified. Accordingly, your answer, just received, expresses the preference on your part, that I should make an open order for the modification, which I very cheerfully do.
It is therefore ordered, that the said clause of said proclamation be so modified, held and construed as to conform with and not to transcend the provisions on the same subject contained in the act of Congress, entitled "An act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes," approved August 6, 1861, and that said act be published at length with this order.
Your obedient servant,
(Signed) A. LINCOLN.
Upon this timid, depressing, suicidal letter of President Lincoln to Col. Fremont, the Boston Transcript, of Tuesday evening, contains the following sensible and scathing editorial comments:-

THE PRESIDENT AND GEN. FREMONT.
In a time like this, subordination is indispensable. Gen. Fremont must obey the President. We have no doubt that the General's duty to his country will be paramount to what he believes was a most unfortunate error of judgment in the President. The country cannot spare the General from its service, and nothing but bitter necessity will ever induce a comparison between the President who might have been elected in 1856, and the President who was elected in 1860. As a matter of feeling and of policy, we should avoid the discussion of this unfortunate difference, were this central question not sure to arise again and again if this war goes on.
But neither the direct conflict of opinion between the two to-day, nor the immense importance of the action of the government and its generals on the great questions involved, will allow us to mince this matter. And we say unhesitatingly that the great blunders of this administration from the start have sprung from the policy, urged by the Secretary of State and adopted by the President, of "What will the border States do?" instead of "What shall the border States do?"
This policy, weak, hesitating, mistaken, was inaugurated by that first six weeks of fatal adoption of Mr. Buchanan's unmasterly inactivity, which not only handed the States which followed the original seven to the conspirators, but for fear of offence, lost its own forts, navy yards, arsenals and strategic bases of operation.
What the great bulk of the people of all parties foresaw, has been the lesson of the last five months; so sad, so sure, so unmistakable, that we had hoped the Government were at last fully up to the wisdom, temper and determination of the people, whose war this is. We mean nothing fanatical or unconstitutional. We only mean the dictates of plain common sense, which proclaimed, as State after State was lost, that what the traitors and neutrals of the border States feared and respectedand what their Union men desired for protectionwas military power. Tennessee was lost for want of it. Maryland was only saved, and is only held through it. Even Western Virginia was only preserved by troops from without its borders. Kentucky, starting with the mean denial of its quota of troops through a Secession Governor, and openly furnishing soldiers to the enemies of the Union, its people divided then and now into active Secessionists, earnest Unionists, and a great body of persons occupying the intermediate, unconstitutional and disgraceful position of "neutrals"-sure to join whichever party was supported by the largest force from without; Kentucky, the home of Clay, the birthplace of Lincoln, with her immense nominal majority for Union, is utterly unable (if her Holts and Prentices know her position) to crush her own traitors and defend her own borders without a large army from the free States.
The time for "shilly-shallying" with any Border State, if it was ever wise, passed months ago. Military power and wholesome fear were the true touchstone of Union. To prevent just such military necessities for martial law and its consequences as have arisen in Missouri, the stern announcement of the application, when necessary, of doctrines like those of Fremont, supported by sufficient armies, was needed at the very time when this Government was rejecting the 500,000 armed men who sprang patriotically to their feet, and who would, if then accepted, have been an army sufficiently drilled for past and immediate efficiency. Can it be that still "What will Kentucky do?" is the timid cry of the administration?
And now, through whose fault was it that these terrible military necessities have arisen in Missouri? Heaven knows that Fremont did not wish them, though he rose, imminent in this great emergency, to meet them. We owe the loss and devastation of a large part of its territory, the division of towns, counties, neighborhoods and families against themselves, the threatening of Cairo and even St. Louis, and, sadder than all, the loss of our heroic general Lyon, to the failure of this government to send the very few regiments and arms the week before the battle of Springfield which it waked up to send a week after.
We have heretofore shown, that if the emergency for martial law could come, it was upon Gen. Fremont, dictating his imperative duty. And now let us see what he had the power to do, and what he did. He was, the President admits, the judge of that emergency. He should have been supported in his acts under it, unless he clearly transcended his powers. No publicist or lawyer will, for a moment, pretend that, martial law once proclaimed, he was to find its interpretation and its limitation in the act of Congress relative to confiscation. Neither that act nor martial law can be narrowed to any such absurd limits. This act, designed especially for such circumstances as those in Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, so long as the laws of those States were not supplanted by martial law, does not in terms or by implication bind a General in the field to limit martial law to its exact methods, but leaves it open to the broad, bold and indispensable laws of war and of nations, with reference to the protection of his government in an emergency of which he is the judge. In fact, that act, without much subtlety of interpretation, can be far more easily found to support and justify his exact action, than that action can be condemned because it had no other support than that law. When the municipal laws of Missouri, and the relations of master and slave are annulled, what or who is the slave? What do confiscation and forfeiture mean?
The President finds no difficulty in overriding the Constitution and laws where martial law has not been proclaimed, by arresting the free citizens of free States, without public charges, sometimes entirely in mistake, always without legal proof; sometimes abandoning those taken when threatened with habeas corpus; sometimes defying habeas corpus itself; and all loyal citizens rejoice to see such decisiveness in this great crisis in our history. But compared with this high-handed exercise of power in the loyal States, the action of Gen. Fremont, in an imminent deadly struggle with traitors from within and without, for the very existence of government in the State which is the key to Kansas and the Pacific, and to Cairo and Memphis, is as simple as it is necessary and inevitable. Why this extreme tenderness for the rebel owners of negroes, where the stern decrees of martial law are thrown over a death grapple, for mastery, which has its origin in a scheme of slave-propagandism, and when this blow can hit a vital spot in the foe,-and at the same time this unhesitating assault upon the personal freedom of white citizens unindicted, untried and unconvicted, in the loyal States? If weakness must be shown in either case, the free States can much more easily dispose of their suspected traitors through their courts of law, than Fremont, acting on the defensive, can repel the blows struck at the very heart of his power. If the Government must have held back any hand, it should have been its own.
We believe in the constitutional rights of loyal States and loyal citizens. So does General Fremont. But we believe, also, in martial law for great emergencies, and that when we are at war, we should conquer our enemies by the application of military means to military ends. Of what earthly use is the strict letter of the confiscation act to General Fremont in the crisis in Missouri? In the smoke and din of battle, can he stop, before declaring free the slaves of masters who are armed to kill his soldiers, to hear proof that the slaves did or did not help build entrenchments? Martial law and his duty as a General, unlimited by, and not conflicting with the act of confiscation, tell him he has no right, when fighting for life, to fail to strike any and every blow known to the laws of war and of nations. Though not at war with a foreign power, we are in actual war, and martial law once proclaimed, carries with it the usages of war and the interpretations of the laws of war.
Some loyal men may possibly suppose that the emergency in Missouri was not sufficient. Of that question they may have an opinion, but they cannot be the judges. But is there an honest man foolish enough to suppose that, in conceivable cases of still more terrible necessity, General Fremont and the President cannot apply the doctrines of the late proclamation without summoning a special session of Congressto meet, perhaps, when the sword has been
<c04>
struck from the General's hand, because he did not deal a fair military blow?
We have no doubt that the proclamation of General Fremont was operating as a wholesome warning to Kentucky. Were it the last as well as the first instance of such a military necessity, we should have avoided all discussion of it. But that we may be prepared for the right action in the uncertain future, it is an imperative duty to discuss boldly and fairly the policy for which this great and pregnant case bids us be ready.

PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S REPLY TO GOVERNOR MAGOFFIN.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Aug. 24,1861
To His Excellency, B. Magoffin, Governor of the State of Kentucky:
SIR,-Your letter of the 19th inst., in which you "urge the removal from the limits of Kentucky of the military force now organized and in camp within said State," is received.
I may not possess full and precisely accurate knowledge upon this subject, but I believe it is true that there is a military force in camp within Kentucky, acting by authority of the United States, which force is not very large, and is not now being augmented.
I also believe that some arms have been furnished to this force by the United States.
I also believe this force consists exclusively of Kentuckians, having their camp in the immediate vicinity of their own homes, and not assailing or menacing any of the good people of Kentucky.
In all I have done in the premises, I have acted upon the urgent solicitations of many Kentuckians, and in accordance with what I believed, and still believe, to be the wish of a majority of all the Union-loving people of Kentucky.
While I have conversed on this subject with many eminent men of Kentucky, including a large majority of her members of Congress, I do not remember that any one of them, or any other person except your Excellency and the bearers of your Excellency's letter, has urged me to remove the military force from Kentucky, or to disband it. One other very worthy citizen of Kentucky did solicit me to have the augmenting of the force suspended for a time.
Taking all the means within my reach to form a judgment, I do not believe it is the popular wish of Kentucky that this force shall be removed beyond her limits; and, with this impression, I must respectfully decline so to remove it.
I most cordially sympathize with your Excellency in the wish to preserve the peace of my native State, Kentucky; but it is with regret I search, and cannot find, in your not very short letter, any declaration or intimation that you entertain any desire for the preservation of the Federal Union.
Your obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.

THE ADMINISTRATION AND SLAVERY. Caleb B. Smith, Secretary of the Interior, in his speech a few weeks since, at Providence, R. I., stated the position of the administration in relation to slavery and the war in the following clear and unmistakable terms:
"I have known the President long and well. It has been my fortune to be selected as one of his constitutional advisers. I have had the honor of being connected with this administration since its commencement, and I tell you to-night that you cannot find in South Carolina a man more anxious, religiously and scrupulously, to observe all the features of the Constitution relating to slavery than Abraham Lincoln. Had the people of the South been willing to wait and see whether he would regard that oath which in the presence of the assembled nation he had taken, they would have found that no administration ever organized in this country would have more conscientiously regarded and protected the rights of the South than this administration would have done. I know that I speak the sentiments of the President and his advisers-of those who have controlled the administration."
FRANKFORT, Ky., Sept. 11. The House has adopted the resolution directing the Governor to issue a proclamation ordering the Confederate troops to evacuate Kentucky soil, by a vote of 71 against 26.
The House then refused to suspend the rules to allow another resolution, to be presented, directing the Governor to issue a proclamation ordering the evacuation of Kentucky soil by both the Federal and rebel troops.
KENTUCKY. The following are the resolutions of the Kentucky Legislature, calling upon Governor Magoffin to drive the rebel forces from that State, and which have been passed over the Secession Governor's veto. They are of the true stamp:-
"Resolved, That Kentucky's peace and neutrality have been wantonly violated, her soil has been invaded, the rights of her citizens have been grossly infringed by the so-called Southern Confederate forces. This has been done without cause; therefore be it 
Resolved, By the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, that the Governor be requested to call out the military force of the State, to expel and drive out the invaders.
Resolved, That the United States be invoked to give that aid and assistance, that protection against invasion, which is granted to each one of the States by the fourth section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the United States.
Resolved, That General Robert Anderson be, and he is hereby requested to enter immediately upon the active discharge of his duties in this military district.
Resolved, That we appeal to the people of Kentucky, by the ties of patriotism and honor, by the ties of common interest and common defence, by the remembrances of the past and by the hopes of the future national existence, to assist in repelling and driving out the wanton violators of our peace and neutrality, the lawless invaders of our soil."
Gov. Magoffin of Kentucky, in obedience to the recent action of the Legislature, has issued a proclamation informing the rebel government that it is expected to withdraw its troops from that State.
CARUAX FERRY, Va., Sept. 13. The battle of last Tuesday at this place was by far the greatest and severest yet fought in Western Virginia. Ex-Secretary of War Floyd commanded the rebels in person, and received a severe wound in the arm, during the engagement.
The rebels had accurate advice of our approach and exact strength, as appears from the papers found in their camp, and had made every preparation to resist an attack. They had six regiments, beside their intrenchments, with artillery sweeping all approaches.
During the whole engagement, lasting nearly four hours, we brought into action only five regiments, and of these, but parts of three were long engaged. The rebels stationed expert riflemen to pick off officers, and fired spelter from their cannona missile unknown to civilized warfare. Experienced military- men say the roar of cannonading and musketry for a time was the heaviest they ever heard, but the rebels fired mostly too high with their artillery. Their squirrel rifles did the most execution. Floyd should be surrounded and his retreat to Lewinsburg cut off.
An immense amount of personal property was found in the rebel camp, but only some fifty wagon loads were thought worthy of transportation, and in this country the whole amount is hardly worth $10,000.
CHICAGO, Sept. 16. Particulars of the Engagement between the Rebels and Col. Montgomery's Kansas Forces Leavenworth papers of the 11th inst. give the following account of the late engagement between Gen Rains and Col. Montgomery on the 2d inst. Gen Rains approached Fort Scott with 600 rebels, and seized 80 mules belonging to the Government and killing a teamster. A message was sent to Montgomery, who had 500 men. He pursued Rains 11 miles, killing several of his men, when, coming on the main body of the enemy, the battle commenced, the rebels having cannon and Montgomery one howitzer only. The fight lasted two hours, when Montgomery slowly retired, keeping up a running fight until nightfall. The enemy's force is reported by prisoners to have been from 2000 to 3000.
The Charleston Mercury has the following items of news:-"The free colored men of Charleston have contributed $450 to sustain the cause of the South. The zealous and unfailing alacrity with which this class of our population have always devoted their labor and their means to promote the safety of the State, is alike honorable to themselves and gratifying to the community.
The business of citizen-making has been going on pretty briskly for the last fortnight. Several residents of foreign birth, anxious to place themselves right upon the record,' appear daily to qualify themselves as citizens of the Confederate States.
The Confederate Congress presented Howell Cobb with a banner, on his resigning his seat in that body to take command of a Georgia regiment."
A Northern man just escaped from Georgia, where he has been in business for several years, informs the Rochester Advertiser that there is a reign of terror in Georgiano Union man dare utter his sentiments, but he believes that fully one-third would rejoice to see the Federal troops enter the State in triumph. The Union men at heart talk the loudest for secession in the streetsand do it for safety and to avoid suspicion. They give money, and even go into the rebel army, but they are, nevertheless, for the Union, and will show it when they can do so without an absolute certainty of death staring at them. Salt is hard to get at five times its valuebacon 21 cents per pound, coffee 45 cents, common satinet $2.50 per yard, boots and shoes at fabulous prices, and difficult to be found at that. Trade is paralyzed, and distress the order of the day.
<c05>
GEN. CASS ON THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY. Gen. Cass, in a recent conversation with President Fair-child, of Hillsdale College, Michigan, said that though he had always been, heretofore, opposed to abolition, yet this was now the only way to successfully and permanently end the contest. Without abolition, if we had peace to-day, we should have war to-morrow. This is saying considerable for one who has always been so conservative as the great Michigan statesman.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Sept 12. The Provost Marshal will issue a proclamation to-morrow, stating that the commanding General has satisfactory evidence that Thomas L. Snead, of this city, having taken an active part with the enemies of the United States, and the Military Commission now in session at the arsenal having reported the facts at headquarters, as a result of its deliberations, the Major-General commanding has executed and published deeds of manumission in favor of Frank Lewis and Hiram Reid, heretofore held to service or labor by said Snead; and they are free, and forever discharged from the bond of servitude, giving them full right and authority to have, use and control their own labor or service as to them may seem proper, without accountability to said Snead.

DELIVERING UP A FUGITIVE SLAVE TO A REBEL OFFICER. The Washington Republican is justly indignant at an act of Gen. Rosseau, commanding the Federal forces in Indiana. A slave named Goree, body servant of Col. Robert Johnson, of the rebel Camp Boone, had escaped, and reached the Ohio river. In swimming that river he became exhausted, and was rescued from drowning by some of the Federal soldiers. Thereupon Gen. Rosseau ordered him to be carried back, by a file of men, to the Kentucky side of the river. This is stated to have been done for the express purpose of his re-delivery to his former master, and, if not done for that purpose, will doubtless result in that as a matter of fact.
It is understood that several army officers have been engaged in returning fugitives to their masters.
FORTRESS MONROE, Sept. 15. A party of fourteen contrabands escaped last night from near Sewall's Point in a canoe, and have arrived here. They represent provisions in Princess Anne county as scarce, that there are some 500 rebel troops at Sewall's Point, and that the force there is constantly changing.
There was a stampede of negroes, 14 in number, consisting of men, women and children, in the neighborhood of Lewinsville, on Monday. They came to our lines, saying they were to be sent to Manassas this morning. Gen. Smith sent them to Washington. They belonged to the estate of the late Commodore Jones. They stated that they left at home only a daughter of the Commodore, her mother having departed some time ago for Manassas Junction.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 14. The fight at Boonville, yesterday morning, terminated in a victory to the Home Guards, under Major Eppstein, who held their entrenchments. The rebels, 1000 strong, were driven back, and were in the neighborhood of Booneville when the Sioux City passed there. The Home Guards lost one man killed and four wounded. The rebels lost 12 killed and 30 wounded. Among the rebels killed were Col. Brown and Capt. Brown.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 16. Col. F. P. Blair, Jr., was ordered, yesterday, by the Provost Marshal, to report himself under arrest, on the general charge of using disrespectful language with reference to Gen. Fremont.
It is understood that the precise charge upon which Col. Blair was arrested is insubordination, in communicating, while a militia officer, with the authorities at Washington, and making complaints against, and using disrespectful language towards Gen. Fremont, with a view to affect his removal.
It is stated that letters written by Col. Blair are now in possession of Gen. Fremont.
NEGROES CANNOT BE ENLISTED. When Captain Hight was mustering the 8th Maine Regiment into the U. S. service, at Augusta, last week, in one of the companies he noticed a negro. He ordered him from the ranks, but the man made his appearance in another section of the company, and his captain insisted upon his being mustered in, as he was a strong and able-bodied man. Captain Hight remarked that he came to muster in white citizens, not negroes. He then inquired he name of the negro, and struck it from the company roll. Shame!

MCCULLOCH'S INDIANS. The Helena (Ark.) Herald of August 10th, states that thirteen hundred Indian warriorsSouthern allieshad crossed the Arkansas river near Fort Smith, en route for McCulloch's camp. These Indians were armed with rifle, butcher-knife and tomahawk, and had their faces painted and seemed eager for the fray.
The rebels near Leesburg have torn up over nine miles of the newly laid track of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, removed the rails, &c., and have commenced to lay a military line from Winchester to Strasburg, thus connecting Harper's Ferry with the Manassas Gap Railroad. They had also taken forcible possession of a large quantity of rolling stock belonging to the same company.
A LARGE BATCH OF FIRST-CLASS CRIMINALS. There are forty-two slave-traders and twenty of the Southern pirates, from the privateers Savannah, Sumter and Jeff. Davis, who are to be tried at the fall term of the United States District Court in New York.
Jeff. Thompson has issued a proclamation, in which, as a retaliatory measure for Gen. Fremont's proclamation, he threatens for every member of the Southern forces or citizen soldiers of Missouri executed to hang, draw and quarter a minion of Abraham Lincoln.
On Monday night last, while a Government steamer, name unknown, was conveying a number of prisoners from Lexington, Mo., to Fort Leavenworth, for better security, she broke her rudder between the Mill and Kansas City, and was obliged to haul to the land. Shortly after reaching the shore, a company of the Jackson county secessionists seized the boat, released the prisoners, and secured some 40 Federal soldiers as captives.
CINCINNATI, Sept. 16. A special dispatch to the Gazette, dated Cassnix Ferry, 11th, says:-"Lee resumed the attack along our whole line at Cheat Mountain, yesterday. After a long contest, Gen. Reynolds fairly repulsed him, with considerable rebel loss, and little or no loss on our side, owing to the fact that our troops fought behind entrenchments."
It has been ascertained that the enemy's loss in the affair at Lewinsville, on Wednesday, is 30 killed, and between 60 and 70 wounded.
ELK WATER, Va. Sept. 16. The body of Col. John A. Washington was sent over to the enemy yesterday, under a flag of truce. While on the way, it was met by a similar flag coming from the enemy, for the purpose of obtaining information as to his condition. He was shot in a foray.
Among the killed by the Little Platte bridge railroad disaster in Missouri, was Barclay Coppic, of John Brown notoriety, together with five or six men who were en route with him to join Montgomery's Kansas regiment.
A shell thrown from one of Loomis's guns, in Western Virginia, two miles into the enemy's camp, killed ten men, and wounded four.
The 13th Indiana regiment had a severe skirmish with superior numbers of the enemy on the 12th, and killed ten or twelve with a trifling loss. As the enemy advanced on the Elk Water, the column was handsomely checked by a detachment of the 17th Indiana regiment.
Lieut. Morrill, of the Topographical Engineers, was taken prisoner on his way to Cheat Mountain.
On the 12th inst., a detachment of 500 men from the 14th Indiana and 24th and 25th Ohio regiments, dispersed three Tennessee regiments under Gen. Anderson, on the west side of Cheat Mountain, completely routing them, killing eighty, and obtaining most of their equipments. Our loss was eight killed.
The arrest of rebel agents in New York has led to the discovery of a carrier pigeon communication from the suburbs of that city with Richmond. A pigeon was shot by a rifleman, and under the bird's wing was an important dispatch on its way South. A shed somewhere on Long Island was used as a starting point for the pigeons.
A correspondent of the Boston Journal writing from Hillsborough, New Hampshire, says:
"I have information direct that ex-President Pierce has been forwarding letters, papers and various documents to Vallandingham, Powell, and others of that stamp, from the Lower Village, his birthplace in this town. I saw he was in Louisville the other day."
The Tribune editorially states that preparations for two important movements against the Southern coast are rapidly going forward; in one of which the land forces will be under Gen. Butler, and the other under Gen. Sherman. The number of troops will be about 25,000, with a naval force of proportionate strength. The points to be assailed are unknown.
Charleston papers say that, within a month, 14 vessels have entered Charleston, and 22 in Wilmington harbor, and that in the same time $180,000 in duties had been paid to collectors.
The Richmond shoe merchants urge the discharge of all shoemakers from the army, and their employment at making shoes of canvass.
DEAD. Ben Wood's secession newspaper, the New- York News, has given up the ghost.
The New York Day Book has suspended, and merged itself into a weekly, to be called the Weekly Caucassian.
Old Mrs. Gurnsey, known to many as the discoverer of the Flume at the Franconia Notch, died at Lisbon, N. H., Sept. 11, aged 75 years.
<c06>
DEATH OF EX-GOVERNOR BRIGGS. Ex-Governor Briggs died at his residence in Pittsfield, (Mass.) last week, most widely and deeply lamented for his solid worth and many shining virtues.
The accident and circumstances attending the death of Gov. Briggs are painfully fresh in the minds of the people. It will be recollected that on Wednesday, the 4th inst., while in the act of taking down his coat from the clothes-press, for the purpose of going to the assistance of some persons in distress, caused by a frightened horse, a loaded gun, which was unobserved, in the haste of the moment, fell and discharged its contents into his face, the charge passing under one jaw and a portion of it through the other side. Twenty-eight shot were extracted from the wound by Drs. Childs and Cady, the surgeons in attendance, and from the first they expressed very little hopes of his recovery. It is now seen how fearfully true were their apprehensions.
From 1820 to 1843, he was a member of Congress from the western district of the State, serving his constituents with great acceptance. From 1844 to 1851, he was Governor of Massachusetts by annual election-a great favorite with the people, and a faithful and most unexceptionable public servant. In 1854, he was appointed Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, which office he continued to hold the courts were re-organized under the administration of Gov. Banks.

AWFUL MASSACRE OF EMIGRANTS. A telegram from Zretra (California) of the 29th ult. states the reported massacre by Indians of an emigrant party on the Northern route is confirmed by the arrival of only one survivor, who reports that there were 14 families, numbering 100 persons, and the whole company of men, women and children were inhumanly butchered.

ANOTHER.TERRIBLE RAILROAD DISASTER. Cincinnati, Sept. 18.-Last night, at half-past 8, the train on the Ohio and Mississippi railroad containing a portion of Col. Forchin's 19th Illinois regiment, while passing over the bridge at Huron, Ind., 143 miles west of Cincinnati, fell through, killing and wounding over 100 soldiers. A special train was sent from here into last night to assist.
It let four cars down into the bed of the creek, and one on top of them. The engine and one car passed over safely. There were about 100 wounded, and 10 or 15 killed. The Colonel of the regiment says there were about that number killed, although nearly the whole company is missing. It is thought the bridge was weakened by malicious scoundrels.
FREDERICK, Md., Sept. 18. The Union members of both Houses refused to meet this morning. The Legislature is virtually dead; all the officers being under arrest to prevent calling the roll.
The Union members will leave this afternoon for home, and the secession members for Fort McHenry. The city is quiet.
The arrest of the clerks will prevent them from calling the roll, and so the Legislature is at an end. Several of the most noisy and active secessionists in town have also been arrested.
Rev. Dr. Cheever has prepared an address entitled "The Voice of Christian England for the Emancipation of the Slave." He delivered this discourse at his own church in New York on Sunday last.
ANOTHER COLORED LAWYER. In the Superior Court, Sept. 14, before Judge Russell, John S. Rock, M. D., was, on motion of T. K. Lothrop, Esq., examined and admitted to practice in all the Courts of this Commonwealth.
The Hartford Courant says that Gen. Lyon left, by will, all his property, valued at $30,000, to the government. He has thus given all that a man could give to his country.
The New Hampshire Gazette, printed at Portsmouth, after one hundred years of existence, has gone by the board. Its title has been purchased by the owners of the Chronicle, of the same place, and will be united with the name of that paper.
BURNING OF THE NAHANT HOUSE. The celebrated Nahant Hotel, at Nahant, was totally destroyed by fire on Wednesday night, last week, at 11 o'clock, with nearly all its contents. In consequence of the prostration of business, the hotel has been closed this season, excepting a small portion, which was kept open by Mr. Learned. He closed that part of the house on Monday, and since that time it has been unoccupied. The fire is supposed to be the work of an incendiary. The whole cost of the hotel, from first to last, was not much less than $175,000.

OBITUARY.
DEATH OF NATHAN WINSLOW, ESQ.
In the Liberator of the 9th ultimo, we recorded the death of Dr. AMOS 
FARNSWORTH, one of the earliest of the little Anti-Slavery band in Massachusetts. This week we are called to record the departure of NATHAN WINSLOW, Esq., of Portland, (Me.) who died in that city, on Monday, Sept. 9th, after a brief illness, aged 76 years and 5 months. His hearty and fearless espousal of the Abolition movement covered a period of thirty years. In the early days of its fiery trials, especially, none was more zealous, more outspoken, or more generous with his means "to help the cause along," than himself. Although, by birth and education a member of the Society of Friends, (whose technical and outward trammels he subsequently transcended,) his abhorrence of negro slavery was innate and uncompromising, and not the result of traditional training. Upon the altar of impartial freedom, he generously offered success in business, social standing, and whatever else it required at his hands., Always frank and courageous, he improved every opportunity to advocate the claims of the suffering bondman, and to rebuke the all-abounding pro-slavery spirit of the age. His co-operation was of great value in many ways, at the very time when most needed. For several years, the elegant hospitality of his home was freely extended to the advocates of the slave, and of other reforms; and many a fugitive slave found safety and succor under his roof.
No sooner was the first number of the Liberator issued, than he became, and continued to the close of life, a subscriber and patronmore than once preventing its suspension by his liberal assistance, and authorizing us to draw upon him at any time, in case of emergency, for the means to continue it. He was "a friend in need" a fast and true friendand, therefore, "a friend indeed." Our recollections of his kindness and hospitality are of the most pleasurable and grateful character. His removal, at a ripe age, is in the order of nature; but we feel the bereavement as though he had been our equal in years.
Soone by onethe early and long-tried friends of the still unpopular cause of the fettered slave are exchanging, the perishable for the enduringthe transient for the permanentthe vestments of decay for the robes of immortality; and, at no distant day, they will all have finished their earthly course,-thanking God, if not permitted to sing the song of jubilee on earth, that they were enabled to endure unto the end in the noblest of moral conflicts and most far-reaching of philanthropic enterprises.
"Baptized in blood for glorious deeds,
O'er falling thrones and flaming creeds,
The Martyr-Angels throng;
Through quickened minds and hearts below,
We hear their golden trumpets blow,
A fiery peal and long.
Give us, O Lord, our God, to be
The mediums of Divinity,
Like Angels great and wise;
With them to labor and to wait
Till thou dost ope the morning gate,
And call us to the skies!"

Poetry
For the Liberator.
THE JUDGE'S DECISION.
Away, on the hills of New England,
In the old heroic time,
When the Priest and the Ruler were making
A theme for the poet's rhyme;
When every man was in earnest,
And meant the thing he said-
For they'd carved the charter of Freedom
With their bayonets, sharp and rod;
There stood, at a Court of Justice,
A black man, huge and grim;
The bondman's fetter and shackle
Were clanking on wrist and limb.
Then Harrington sat in judgment,
As they led the prisoner in, 
To be tried for the crime of condition,
For the guilt of a colored skin!
Soft was the mien of the claimant,
As the airs of the balmy South;
Like the musical ripple of waters
Were the words that fell from his mouth:-
"May it please your honor, this servant
From his Christian service ran;
And so, he hath wronged his master,
A noble and chivalrous man.
"By the rule of the Law and the Gospel,
The servant that runneth away
Shall be sent, by the Judge or Apostle,
To his master, without delay."
Just then, the sun in the heaven
Broke in, like a golden wave;
It fell on the Judge and the claimant,
It fell on the chain of the slave.
It streamed through the crowded court-room,
And lighted the faces of all;
Like a halo, it dwelt on the pictures
Of the worthies that hung on the wall.
It seemed like an Iris of Freedom,
Golden-winged, from the Just and the Brave,
Who spoke through the Judge as he questioned
The proof, that the man was a slave.
They gave him the oath of the master,
And the oaths of more of that sort,
Bills of sale from trader and planter,
And records of county and court.
The Judge ran his eye o'er the papers,
He turned them around and around;
He looked on the sun in the heaven,
He looked on the poor and the bound.
And his eye caught a glimpse of the future,
Of the Judgment of Judges-to be!
And, slowly and lowly, he uttered,
"These papers are nothing to me.
"From the font of our own Revolution,
From the paths that our martyrs have trod,
Shall I render a MAN to a master,
When the ownership resteth in God?
"Nothing less than a warrant from Heaven
In the case shall be binding on me:
For I rule, that the Law and the Gospel
Command that all men shall be free."
B. RUSH PLUMLY.

For the Liberator.
THE PROSPECT.
AIR: "What fairy like music."
"Lift up your heads: for your redemption draweth nigh."-CHRIST.
Weep no longer, ye captives, your redemption is near!
Every day brings some tidings your spirits to cheer;
While men's hearts are full of the spirit of fight,
Out of all this gross darkness God will bring to you light.
Yo who've toiled long as bondmen, in sorrow and pain,
T rodden down by your masters-made vassals for gain-
Shall ere long be delivered, for God doth decree
That the black and the white shall be all alike free.
Though the great men of earth may unite all their skill
To cover up Justice, and Truth's voice to still,
In a moment unlooked for shall a voice come from heaven,
Saying, Strike off the fetters-let freedom be given."
How cheering the prospect which breaks on the view,
When our country no more shall be ruled by the few;
When all men as brothers acknowledged shall be,
And our land be the home of the brave and the free!
Dry your tears, then, ye captives, and lift up your head,
Freedom's hosts are uprising, filling tyrants with dread;
Soon your chains shall be riven, your shouts rend the air,
And God be acknowledged the hearer of prayer.
A "good time is coming"-have patience to wait-
God shall raise up the fallen, and humble the great;
His will shall on earth as in heaven be done,
And slavery no more shall be known 'neath the sun.
Boston, Sept. 5, 1861.
JUSTITIA.

From the Boston Transcript.
FORWARD!
BY REV. JOHN PIERP0NT.
God, to the human soul,
And all the spheres, that roll,
Wrapped, by His spirit, in their robes of light,
Hath said, The primal plan
Of all the worlds, and man,
Is forward! Progress is your law,-your right."
The despots of the earth,
Since Freedom had her birth,
Have, to their subject nations, said, Stand still!
So, from the polar Bear,
Comes down the freezing air,
And stiffens all things with its deadly chill.
He who doth God resist-
God's old antagonist-
Would snap the chain that binds all things to Him;
And, in his godless pride,
All peoples would divide,
And scatter even the choirs of seraphim.
God all the orbs that roll
Binds to one common goal-
One source of light and life-His radiant throne.
In one fraternal mind
All races would He bind,
Till every man, in man, a brother own.
Tyrants with tyrants league;
Corruption and Intrigue
To strangle infant Liberty conspire.
Around her cradle, then,
Let self-devoted men
Gather, and keep unquenched her vital fire.
When Tyranny, grown bold,
To Freedom's host cries "Hold! 
Ye toward her temple at your peril march-
"Stop," that great host replies,
Raising to heaven its eyes,
"Stop, first, the host that moves across yon arch!"
When Tyranny commands,
"Hold thou my victim's hands,
While I more firmly rivet on his chains,
Or, with my Bowie knife,
I'll take your craven life,
Or show my streets bespattered with your brains-
Freedom, with forward tread,
Unblenching turns her head,
And drawing from its sheath her flashing glave,
Calmly makes answer,-Dare
Touch of my head one hair,
I'll cut the cord that holds your every slave!

THE DEPARTED.
The outward world is dark and drear
When friends we love are seen no more;
But, hark! their happy songs we hear
In music from the spirit shore.
We wake no more by night to mourn;
They are not lost, but gone before;
And still their loving thoughts are borne
In music from the spirit shore.

LETTER
To a Missionary of The American Board" now in this Country.
BOSTON, Sept 8th, 1861.
REV. JUSTIN PERKINS:
SIR-Your note of the 5th inst, received yesterday, designates as false" my statement respecting you on page 216 of the book entitled Relation of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions to Slavery."
This statement was that, instead of taking a decided and active part in opposition to slavery," (in the Annual Meeting of the Board in 1859,) you remained silent" while Rev. Henry T. Cheever and Rev. Dr. George B. Cheever were urging immediate and energetic measures against slavery and the slave trade.
I added to this that you preserved a like shameful silence, though present, when the yet worse transactions of the next Annual Meeting were going on."
But since you do not pretend that this second statement is incorrect, my examination of authorities, to see whether I have even accidentally misrepresented you, may be confined to the first.
I looked, for information in regard to your demeanor at the Meeting of the Board at Philadelphia, in 1859, first to the Annual Report of the Prudential Committee for that year, and next to the extended reports of that meeting in the Recorder and the Congregationalist.
The Annual Report does not mention you as speaking at all, while either slavery or the slave trade was under discussion.
The Congregationalist does not mention you as speaking at all in regard to the very important motion made by Dr. Cheever, that the Board declare the holding of slaves an immorality, inconsistent with membership in any Christian church," and require that the Choctaw mission churches should immediately put away from themselves this sin." It does not mention you as speaking at all upon the very important motion made by Rev. Henry T. Cheever, that the Prudential Committee be instructed to carry on the Choctaw mission by the appointment and substitution of other missionaries than the present incumbents." It however gives the following as the substance of your remarks on Dr. George B. Cheever's proposition, that the Board address to Congress a memorial against the enlargement and legalization of the foreign slave trade:-
"Dr. Perkins, as a returned Missionary, said he had always been outspoken on this general subject, and he wished to bear testimony that no influence had been exerted to induce him to keep silence. During his twenty-five years' absence from the country, many things had transpired, that prophecy would have been wild to predict; and the re-opening of the slave trade would have been regarded as the most distant of all probabilities. It curdled his blood, almost, to think that, for a moment, the idea should be entertained. He trusted and prayed that the Board might not shrink from any responsibility that God, the friend of the slave, had put upon them in this matter."
The Recorder does not mention you as speaking at all on the first two of the three most needful and timely propositions above-mentioned. Upon the third, it gives the following, as the substance of your remarks:-
"Rev. Dr. Perkins, of Persia, wished to testify that he had never been pressed by the Board in relation to slavery and the expression of his views upon it. In the twenty-five years since he left, nothing more strange had happened than the opening of the slave trade; he prayed the Board might not shrink from responsibility, although he would not urge precipitate action."
Here, then, is the substance of your remarks, and the whole of what you are reported to have said in regard to slavery, out of the mouths of two disinterested witnesses. Let us examine what ground is covered, first by your speech, and next by your silence.
You are shocked at the idea of enlarging and legalizing the foreign slave trade. So is Chancellor Walworth, one of the strongest defenders of the Board's complicity with slavery in this country! You pray that the Board may not shrink from responsibility. So does every member of it, as a matter of course! In the Congregationalist's report, you seem to become more specific, trusting and praying that the Board may not shrink from any responsibility that God, the friend of the slave, had put upon them in this matter." But the minuteness of specification is only seeming. Dr. South-side Adams trusts and prays the same thing; and what he means by it is, that friendship for the slave requires him to be kept in slavery, and that the Board's "responsibility" requires it not to interfere with that relation! What you said at the meeting of the Board in Philadelphia, therefore, does not in the least distinguish you from its most pro-slavery members. You did not urge them to any measure whatever of opposition, either to slavery or the slave trade, according to the reports of your two Orthodox brethren!
Moreover, besides failing to make any protest on your own account against the pro-slavery position of the Prudential Committee (while it remained uncertain whether the Board would authorize that position, and while, therefore, faithfulness on your part might have caused a different result) you shrank from supporting either of three special movements made by others in that direction. Is it not true, and is it not shameful," that on this occasion you were silent"? In regard to the advocacy of a much-needed reform, and in regard to exposure and rebuke of the Board's aggravated guilt, certainly you were silent."
But you represent it as an important point-and as tending to counterbalance the proof offered by Dr. Cheever, that silence in regard to slavery had been enforced upon some of the Board's missionaries-that no influence had been used by the Prudential Committee to induce you to keep silence! What then? Why should they wish to silence you? You were one of their defenders. There is no evidence that you have ever attempted to rebuke their sin, or to speak to them at all in behalf of Christ's little ones whom they were helping their Cherokee and Choctaw church-members to keep in slavery! This very forbearance of the Prudential Committee towards you strengthens the evidence of your guilt!
It appears, moreover, that in accusing you only of shameful silence on the occasion in question, I treated you too leniently; for the Recorder's report represents you as discouraging the reformation urged by Dr. Cheever; you would not urge precipitate action."
The action which Dr. Cheever urged was immediate remonstrance against a most pernicious movement (one so bad that the mere thought of it almost curdled your blood) which was at that moment vigorously urged forward by many Southern people, and which seemed likely to be accomplished before another Annual Meeting of the Board. This immediate remonstrance was the movement in question, and this you implied to be precipitate." How could the policy of the Prudential Committee have been better served? Why should they have wished to stop your mouth?
For some time past, not only has a shameful silence in regard to the pro-slavery course of the Prudential Committee been your accustomed policy, but you have given much aid in persuading the people of this country to yield them renewed confidence and support. It is too late, now, for you to obey the inspired precept of Jeremiah-"Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor." The morning is past; the eleventh hour is already come; but the lamp still holds out to burn, and you may yet, if you will, at the approaching meeting of the Board, make-earnest appeal to them to withdraw their shameful concurrence in the monstrous declaration of the Prudential Committee, that The Cherokees are a Christian people"; even if a union of that nation with the rebels now waging war against the United States shall prevent the present fulfillment of the Board's further duty, namely, to send to that slaveholding
<c03>
people missionaries who shall really preach Christianity to them.
Trusting that you may have courage and honesty enough for the performance of these duties, I am Your friend and servant for the truth,
CHARLES K. WHIPPLE.
ADDRESS,
Delivered at the Commencement Exercises at the Normal Institute for Physical Education, Boston, Sept. 5,
BY MISS ABBY W. MAY.
GENTLEMEN AND LADIES-In the period of universal reform, through which we have been passing, it was both natural and proper that woman should arouse herself, and ask-Am I keeping time to the world's great onward march? Am I in possession of all my rights and privileges? Am I doing my whole duty? To these important questions, the answers have been as varied as the temperaments and characters of those who made reply. Ignorant and foolish women were ready with a flippant retort; timid conservatives shrank from facing the obstacles that stood in the way of what they admitted to be a needed reform, and so preferred to let pretty well" alone; but the thoughtful and earnest of my sex have pondered the grave question, and, spite of the difficulties in the way of a satisfactory solution, have confessed that woman is not fulfilling her destiny. It is not my purpose, to-night, to enter into any consideration of the great question of woman's sphere. I shall merely make one affirmation in relation to it, to which I am sure you will all accede; I shall then endeavor to trace the connection between it and the matter that especially concerns this occasion; for the interest that has brought us together to-night is of no small importance to woman. I am not unmindful of its great value to the other sex. Neither man nor woman is complete without physical culture adopted for its own sake, and only discontinued as a special branch of study and practice when the occupation of the individual is proved to answer every physical need. But man's education and ordinary habits of life enable him to do without it, as woman cannot.
I affirm, then, that woman was created for a lofty purpose,-that a great work has been given her to do; and I know that you will readily admit the statement. How, then, is she fitted, by her present mode of life, to do that work?
Look, first and carefully, at her style of dress. I speak of no particular class of women. Unhappily, our hardest workers copy the follies in dress of our most inactive class. Would that our laboring women were blessed, as those of the old world, with a peasant's costume! Where is the woman who, in her usual dress, can raise her arm perpendicularly above her head, or thrust it forward, backward, or sideways to its full length? If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you can find one woman able to do thus, you are more fortunate than I have been. But why the nice adjustment of shoulder joint and muscle, if not for these very uses? Or shall we ask for free motions of the leg? No: that were too foolish a demand on limbs that, for the greater part of their life, have been fettered by trailing skirts and cumbersome drapery. But perhaps you will say this freedom is unnecessary for refined and cultivated women; leave it for the working classes." Putting out of the question the responsibility that the more fortunate ought to feel for those less wise than they, I answer to this, that I believe God knows none other than working classes." They who are idle are so not by virtue of His will, but by their own misfortunes or unfaithfulness. Who ever framed a delicate and elaborate machine, capable of mighty and varied uses, for ornament merely? Human Economy forbids us to admit, for a moment, that Divine Power could so trifle. But for an instant we will allow our delicate and noble woman to be crippled, as to her limbs; we will count freedom of motion vulgar, fit only for those who do our most menial work; and may they burst off the buttons to secure it! And we will think only of those vital organs which affect the life of the individual alone. What of the lungs, whose utmost expansion is none too great thoroughly to purify the blood, upon which this delicate beauty is dependent, not only for life, but for that comeliness which is so important to her? Her lungs never expand, as her pale cheeks, and feeble breath, and low average of vitality amply testify. Her cramped stomach labors to do its duty, and fails, in a great majority of cases. And her heart is so misplaced, that the efforts of the whole male sex would fail to set it right. Nor does the trouble end here. This imperfect physical life makes constant and fearful calls on the brain; and, in multitudes of cases, that crowning organ of humanity is useful principally as a telegraph-operator, to receive messages of distress pouring into it from the much-abused dependents, which would be excused if they tried to secede. I think it perfectly safe to say, that no important function of a woman's body can be carried on in perfection, with the present style of dress. And if the physical laws are all broken, we cannot expect the intellectual, moral and spiritual life to be healthy and lofty. It is true, exceptional cases may be found, but we want a universal rule that will be better than any exception. I believe insanity and morbid spiritual experiences would greatly diminish in this generation, if woman would at once inaugurate a reform in dress; and, in generations yet to come, the gain would be beyond computation. Nor need the changes be so great as to shock the most modest, or interfere with the most refined taste. That mantua-maker must be a poor student of her art indeed, who, with the endless variety of ornament which French skill is constantly devising, cannot make a dress handsome, and even without a noticeable departure from the prevailing mode, at the same time that she gives its wearer room to breathe and to digest. A woman who should adapt her dress to physiological laws would lose at once, it is true, that graceful outline which the mantua-maker's idea of beauty of form has made current among us; but she would gain within the year a breadth, and solidity, and vigor, that are priceless; and eventually the firm muscle and the delicate tissue would bring back to earth such beauty as God made, and set in Paradise. Oh! women of thought and conscience, consider well this matter, as it deserves. Go home; consign all bones not yours by birthright to the comparative anatomist; leave street-sweeping to our city fathers; wrestle with the tempter until you slay him; and go forth from the combat, resolved no longer to bow down to the Demon of Fashion. Ye cannot serve God and him!
I would not have occupied so much of your time with this matter of dress, were it not that it is directly connected with the new gymnastics. Dr. Lewis regards a reform in this direction as of the utmost importance; and every performer of his series of exercises will, I believe, find that a dress which prevents all the motions,-at least of the upper part of the body,-from being freely made, must be wrong; since there is no forced use of limb or muscle encouraged or even allowed by the system.
But when we have freed woman from the slavery of dress, we have only taken the first step. How shall we bring back the lost power and grace to the enfeebled frame? I will not speak of the need of fresh air, abundant bathing, and a rational diet. These are equally required by both sexes; and, too, the public mind is becoming rapidly enlightened about them. But I wish I could pay a just tribute to the father of this new system of physical training. I believe he has given fresh life to many a sufferer; and by the scheme which he has founded, has inaugurated a reform not second in importance to any moral or intellectual reform. The noblest achievement for the human race is a perfect body, until that has been attained: afterward, we climb may from sphere to sphere of glory. There never was a noble, enduring building erected on a poor foundation: there never will be. Hitherto, in the world's history, one set of powers has usually been cultivated to the neglect of another. One man treated himself as if he were nothing but a brain;
<c04>
another was but a magnified heart; still another exaggerated his muscular powers, by forced means, until he was only a huge body. But it is to be hoped that the time for all this is past; so far as this system goes, it surely is. Here man is studied as a complex being. His higher nature is no longer to be sacrificed, because the more material part is suffered to run to waste. A system of gymnastics is no new thing; but the peculiarity and crowning excellence of this system are new; at least, so far as Anglo-Saxon experience is concerned. Its novelty consists in this, that every muscle, every limb, every organ, has been studied with a view to its relation to man as a harmonious and immortal being. Each part is honored for its own sake, and also for the sake of the soul, whose servant it is. Here, each enters on a course of harmonious development, that ends only in perfection. It is no child's play. It is obedience to God's will, as manifested in our flesh. It contains, too, the element of constant growth, and so secures to itself perpetual youth, and ever-widening usefulness and fame. It were vain for me to seek words to express what I believe to be the value of this new school of physical training, to woman in especial. It cannot be so measured. Its power has begun to be felt; it will not cease until all physical life shall be supplanted by that which never dies.
Friends, I ventured, just now, to presume on your assent to a statement I then made. Permit me to hope that the deductions I have made from it, or, rather, the great truth which underlies all I have tried to say, may strike home to your hearts, and spread, by its own power, from one to many, until the external and physical condition of woman may become such as to fit her for the moral and intellectual position that she ought to occupy.
Classmates, the time has come for us to bid farewell to our teachers, and to one another. It were idle to linger over the word. The golden hours of summer have borne forever into the past the nine weeks of earnest purpose that have held us together here. They have been weeks of unbroken harmony; of much labor, of a kind that was new to nearly all of us; but of a wholesome and increasing satisfaction that I think I may say we never knew before. To our teachers, we owe our hearty and respectful thanks. Where each one has been so able in his own department of science, and each so devoted to our service, it were invidious to single out any one for an especial thank-offering, were it not that he who is the founder of this Institution has, by the nature of his relation to it, been called upon to make the greatest sacrifices of time and strength for our welfare: all of which he has done with a zeal and patience which have been a daily surprise, even to those of us who, from previous acquaintance with him, had been led to expect very great devotion. Henceforth, we shall delight to think of him as one who holds our welfare very near his own; we shall turn to him for sympathy and encouragement in our failures, and shall love to bring our successes to him as belonging more to him than to ourselves.
We part to-night, never, in all probability, to meet again. Our country, soon we trust to be united and free, offers a wide field for our exertions. In our own unaided strength, we can do little; but let us go forth to our work with full assurance, that He, in whose service we are to labor, will make us strong unto the end, if we put our trust in Him.

STATE OF THE COUNTRY.
MECHANIC FALLS, Aug. 30, 1861.
DEAR FRIEND GARRISON:
I have written several letters for the Liberator, lately, some of which have not appeared, unless they were in numbers which I have happened not to receive; but it is no manner of consequence, for, among your numerous contributors and voluminous correspondence, it cannot be expected that everything can find a place in the paper, and none can be of less consequence than the contributions that I occasionally offer.
Among the interesting contents of the Liberator, I have been much gratified and instructed by reading the discourse of Rev. A. D. Mayo, in the paper of August 16th, in the perusal of which I was reminded of James Boyle's letter, published in 1838; and I have just risen from a re-perusal of that letter, so prophetic of the events which have transpired since the period of its publication and of the present state of the country, and I cannot but think it would be refreshing to the readers of the Liberator to ponder the following extract:-
"Now look at our own country. We are able to exert no more than a moral influence on the slaveholder. We can affect nothing, unless we can bring him to see his sin, and voluntarily to renounce it. But to me, insurmountable difficulties are in the way, so far as moral suasion is concerned. The oppressor, with the obstinacy and desperation of a demon, has closed up every avenue of access to his understanding and conscience, so far as this has been in his power. He has transformed the pages of the Bible into brazen shields, to ward off every arrow of truth. He has thrown around him a rampart of spungy priests, who, like bales of cotton, extract the momentum from the balls that are levelled at his callous heart. He has trampled under his impious feet the rebukes and remonstrances of the civilized world. He has shown a Corinthian impudence that would look the moral world out of countenance. He has perpetrated the most daring and unparalleled piracy to give unending perpetuity to his crime. He has sworn eternal allegiance to the prince of murderers, and sold himself, body, soul and spirit, to perpetual evil. Every sect, with the exception of the Quakers, (and they dare not bark,) which inhabits his territory-their Judas like priesthood, who teach for hire and divine for money-the great body of the equally corrupt clergy, and corpulent, gouty sects of the North-the greater influence of a psuedo religious press-the worshippers of Mammon, a mighty host-a widely-extended, unprincipled political press-the two great political parties, which divide the country in their sordid strife for the spoils of office-the vast army of office-holders, without feeling and without honesty-the governments of nearly all the States, and the government of the United States-all combine to justify, to protect, and defend him.
I know there is nothing too hard for the Lord-that he is able to surmount all these or any other obstacles. But what reason have we to expect that He will interpose His all-conquering arm to rescue suck a nation as this?-a nation that has proved recreant to every principle upon which its government is ostensibly based, and for the rectitude of which, in their birth, they most solemnly appealed to Heaven;-a nation more perfidious than Arabs or Algerians, guilty of the blackest perjury before all the world, in violating solemn treaties with the grievously-wronged Indian, scattered and peeled and driven with force and cruelty from his rightful home;-a nation guilty of the most high-handed and daring robberies;-a nation dyed in the blood of stolen Africans, of murdered slaves and murdered Indians;-a nation which weighs every principle and every interest of heaven and earth in the scales of avarice, and calculates their value-accordingly;-a nation which has trampled on all justice, all law, all government, all truth and righteousness, in efforts to crush the best friends of our common humanity;-a nation which, like the drunkard or the maniac, has lost the power of self-recovery, and is every way worthy to be a proverb among all the nations of the earth. 'Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? Nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush! Therefore, they shall fall among them that fall, at the time that I visit them; they shall be cast down, saith the Lord. Shall I not visit for these things! saith the Lord; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?'
There is a certain class of medicines, powerful, but equally valuable, which, when administered to a patient in whom the vital stamina is not materially injured, invariably effect a cure; but which, when administered to one whose constitution is imperceptibly, yet irrecoverably impaired or undermined by a complication of diseases, have no other tendency than to develop the most frightful symptoms, such as deadly chills, violent convulsions, and raving delirium-and hence, hurries him to the tomb. The state of this latter patient I consider a just representation of the moral, religious and political condition of this country generally. Abolition would effect a cure, if there was enough of vitality to sustain its operation; but fierce diseases having pertinaciously seized on every part, its only tendency is to develop (not create) appalling symptoms of deep decay and speedy dissolution."
What has become of James Boyle? Has he died in retirement, still beloved and unforgotten? I think his judgment of the patient was not quite correct; for, although the disease was deep and violent, I think that abolition may still effect a cure. I think, certainly, no other remedy will; and the disease has
<c05>
been so long and so violent, that recovery must be slow, and the period of convalescence long, before health is restored. All now depends upon the skill, judgment and courage of our political doctors in prescribing the medicine; and if the chief physician acts wisely, the patient may not only live, but acquire a condition of health and vigor it has never experienced; for the disease being congenital, the nation has never yet enjoyed a healthy existence. I hardly think the patient is yet quite sick enough, and has not yet suffered quite enough to be ready for the medicine; but when the moment of the crisis arrives, the doctor must compel him to swallow it, or consent to see him die. But to drop metaphor. I doubt not that if government would accept the services of colored men, proclaim liberty to all the slaves, with a reasonable compensation to loyal masters, the war could be brought to an end in sixty days-thus saving thousands of lives, and costing no more money than it will to carry on the war for two years. Every rebel would claim loyalty the moment their case appeared hopeless.
Some men, and many of them, even, in the Republican party, cannot distinguish between an act of emancipation and organizing the slaves into the army, and the exciting of insurrection; but it is necessary, although extremely trying, to labor to teach stupidity, and particularly that stupidity which is the result of moral obtuseness. Still, I think persevering precept, and one or two more Bull Run expeditions, will open the understandings of some seemingly hopeless cases.
Had I twelve sons and six men servants, and government should say to me, We want your twelve sons to die for the country," I would answer, Here are six of my sons and six servants, who offer their services. Take them, and then, if these are killed, or if they be not enough, you shall have the other six, and myself with them." If government should reply, We want your sons, but your servants we will not have under any conditions," I would answer, Then, with my consent, you shall not have one of them." When the people come to look at the subject in this light, Slavery will go out, and Liberty triumph.
"Dearly beloved, the morning cometh, and also the night; but the night first."

TRAIT0RS IN THE REVOLUTION.
The following extracts, of Newspapers in the Revolution," and action of State Legislatures," from the pen of B. J. Lossing, the Revolutionary historian, will be read with interest as a similarity in the present state of the country:-
"In all colonies there were only thirty-seven newspapers, and of these, at the time in question, only seven were devoted to the interests of the British government. These were soon stifled by public opinion wherever the Whigs, as the patriots were called, bore rule, while five of the remaining thirty were seduced by gold or frightened by innuendoes into the support of the Crown. Rivington's Royal Gazette, published in New York, took ground boldly against the Revolutionary movement; and at noonday, late in the autumn of 1775, it was 'surprised by one hundred light horsemen from Connecticut, led by Capt. Sears, a distinguished' Son of Liberty,' in New York. They destroyed the press and other apparatus, put the type into bags, and, without one word of complaint from the people, returned to Connecticut, carrying with them a tory clergyman named Seabury, who had preached against the Whigs and the Continental Congress. The type they cast into bullets. All the people, except the' peace party' of that day, said, Amen! After that, the newspaper press ceased to be troublesome to the Whigs, and pamphleteers wrote anonymously.
In the course of the war for independence, the several State Legislatures passed numerous acts for the punishment of the sympathizers with the enemies of the country. In Massachusetts, they could be arrested under a Magistrate's warrant, and banished, unless they would take the oath of allegiance to the Whig cause. The selectmen or trustees of towns could prefer charges of political treachery in town meetings, and the accused, if convicted by a jury, might be immediately banished into the region occupied by the enemy. Many persons were subjected to these penalties in that State.
Rhode Island passed laws still more severe against the tories. Any person who should communicate with the ministry, or their representatives, or who should pilot armed ships of the King's, or who afforded supplies to the enemy's forces, might, by law, be punished by death and confiscation of estate. There were, also, special acts passed in that State, by which the property of certain persons named was confiscated and sequestered.
In Connecticut, speaking, writing or acting against the doings of Congress, or the Assembly of Connecticut, subjected the offender to the penalties of disqualification for office, the seizure of his arms and imprisonment. For furnishing the royal troops with supplies or personal aid, the offender might be punished by the confiscation of his estate, and imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years.
In New Hampshire, similar laws were passed, and under them a large number of tories, former citizens of that commonwealth, were prohibited from entering within her borders; and the estates of about thirty residents were confiscated.
In New York, those who were opposed to the Declaration of Independence were prohibited from practising law in the courts, and their estates might be confiscated. A parent whose sons joined the enemy was taxed nine pence on the pound of his estate for each and every such son. County committees were authorized to apprehend and decide upon the guilt of all persons who should be accused of correspondence with the enemy; and they had the power to punish them with imprisonment or banishment.
The Legislature of Virginia provided by law that certain tories should be treated as aliens, their property to be sold, and the proceeds placed in the public treasury. They also, by law, forbade certain persons entering the bounds of that commonwealth, and subjected them to penalties for the violation of the command.
New Jersey passed several acts for the punishment of tories, subjecting them to imprisonment and forfeiture of estates."
A VISIT TO THE HOSPITAL.
In company with Dr. Curtis of Boston, who has recently been appointed Brigade Surgeon, I visited the hospital north of the City Hall, at the Infirmary building, this afternoon. Passing through the lower ward to the rear of the building, we came to a row of tents, in one of which was a soldier, private Bailey, Mass. 14th, who had received a fracture of one of his legs by falling into the trench at Fort Albany. By his side sat the wife of Rev. Mr. Barker, Chaplain of the 14th. The nature of the wound was such that he was compelled to lie in one position, and the poor fellow was nervous and restless; but the affectionate words, the gentle acts, and warm sympathy of Mrs. Barker, soothed the pain. It was very touching to see how warmly he grasped her hand, and held it as if it were his mother's. She is as a mother to him, and not only to him, but to all in the hospital. Determined not to be behind her husband in doing good, and obeying the warm impulses of her heart, she obtained permission to visit the infirmary. She found that, though the general management was excellent, almost every patient was in want of something, not merely to make them comfortable, but which was indispensable to their speedy restoration. She systematized her investigation, making notes of things wanted for the various patients, then proceeded to the sanitary commission and made a requisition, or stated what was wanted. The commission at once complied with her request, and gave her carte blanche to go and come at all times, and agreed to honor all her requisitions. She visits the infirmary daily-talks with the patients, writes letters for them, supplies them with the little things which in a large hospital are generally overlooked. Her presence fills the wards with joy. I do not wonder that the English soldier kissed the shadow of Florence Nightingale when she passed through the ward, after having seen the light which kindles in the countenances of the patients in the hospital here, when their kind friend makes her appearance. One poor fellow who is slowly recovering from an amputation of an arm, rendered necessary in consequence of a wound received at Bull Run, whose education was not obtained at Harvard, with much earnestness remarked that she was an epistle of mercy!" The mingling of terms can well be pardoned, in view of the warmth of his gratitude.-Washington corr. Boston Journal.

LETTER FROM GEN. B. F. BUTLER.
The Lowell Advertiser publishes the following letter upon the state of the country, and the coming election in Massachusetts:-
U. S. STEAM FRIGATE MINNESOTA,
Off Cape Hatters, Aug 27, 1861 
MY DEAR FRIEND,-I have received your note, as well as those of many others of my true friends in Massachusetts, asking my opinion about political questions, and- some kindly suggesting my name as a candidate for Governor, at the ensuing election. I reply to you as representing them all because our intimacy will permit more frankness than would seem meet towards those less closely connected As I have stated to you, and as I have publicly repeated, when I left home I left all polities, in a party sense of the term, behind me. and I now know no politics in any sense, save as represented by the question-How best to preserve the Union and restore the country to its integrity? Peace is desirable to all, and to none more so than to the soldier who has left his friends and his home to do his duty to his country. But however desirable, it is not to be purchased upon any terms, save the recognition of the authority of the Federal Government over every inch of territory which ever belonged to it. Upon no condition whatever, other than this, would I consent to peace. A peace involving the disintegration of the Union, or until the supremacy of the Government is forever established, would be simply a declaration of perpetual war of sections. Were the Southern Confederacy to-day acknowledged in the fullness of good faith, two months would not elapse before causes of war would arise, sufficient not only to justify, but to demand a renewal of the conflict. No two months have passed, in the last ten years at least, in which outrages have not been committed upon Northern men in the South, which, had they been perpetrated. by a foreign nation, would have demanded a redress of grievances, under pain of a suspension of diplomatic relations. But we have borne these outrages because there was no tribunal to the arbitrament of which we could submit them, and it was against the genius of our people to appeal to arms. Therefore I see with pain, upon the part of some of those with whom I have acted in political organizations, a disposition to advocate peaceful settlements wherein there can be no peace. Therefore this war must go on, not for the purpose of subjugation-but if those. who have commenced it bring upon themselves that condition as an incident, it will only be another illustration of the fruit of sowing the wind. Besides these, there are no other polities.
On the matter of nomination, I cannot consent that my name shall be used by any party. While on some things, as you are aware, I do not agree with the principles upon which both the State and the National administrations were inaugurated, yet we are a long way past that. The Republican party, having won a political victory, both in the State and in the Nation, is entitled to the patriotic endeavor of every man to give it a fair trial in the administration of the government, and in that, it should, as it does, take the lead in official positions. And now there is left nothing for us to contend against, save any corruption, inefficiency or impropriety of administration, which I doubt not would at once be rebuked as well by Republicans as by Democrats. But as far as regards the personnel of administration, in the State, I believe Gov. Andrew has endeavored faithfully, zealously and efficiently to put our Commonwealth on the side of the nation and to sustain, the Union. I, therefore, for one, would not desire to see a change in the Executive, although, I doubt not, people will demand changes in some of the minor officers. I do not say that I would vote for Gov. Andrew, but were I at home, I would not vote against him. Let it be understood, that without distinction of party and without raising party issues, all men who love the Union are determined to stand by it and the country, until this rebellion shall be quelled, and then we may hereafter divide as we please upon the minor differences of administration of government.
To you, my dear friend, I need urge no justification for this course. You will appreciate it, for you are aware of the sacrifice, both of feeling and of position. I made a year ago, in the earnest endeavor to save the country from this calamity, which I then partly foresaw, and, acting in the best light I had, endeavored to prevent. And I am ready to make a like sacrifice now to repel that which I then sought to avert. I need to thank you and others of my friends for this, among many other kindnesses you have shown me.
Very truly yours,
BENJ. F. BUTLER.

LETTER FROM THOS. FRANCIS MEAGHER.
HEADQUARTERS IRISH BRIGADE, 
596 Broadway, Sept. 11, 1861. 
MY DEAR TREANOR,-I have this moment sent you word by the wires, that, very probably, I shall send you the name of a Colonel to-morrow. In the meanwhile, work away like a trooper, and mind what I urged upon you-don't enlist any but decent, intelligent, steady and brave young fellows-no rowdies, no loafers, no broken-down political hacks and hirelings, for God's sake, and the sake of the Country! We are getting on gloriously here. Within a fortnight our three regiments-one of them being a regiment of flying artillery-will be complete. I have telegraphed to my friend Sergeant Tom O'Neill, requesting and authorizing him to raise a squadron of 100 men. Should he do so, if he has no objection, we shall bring him along here, for we shall all be right glad to have the dashing Irish dragoon protecting our guns. I purpose being in Boston in the course of ten days or a fortnight, and will deliver an address on the Rational Cause, the Stars and Stripes, and the Irish Brigade. The glorious three in glorious unity must win. No retreat, next time. Stand or fall-victory or death-but no retreat-no retreat"-that's the marching and rallying cry next fight we have. Heavens! isn't it glorious to have such a country, and such a cause, and such a flag to battle for? The Irishman who is not with us in this contest-with us heart and soul-let him never utter another syllable about the liberty of Ireland.
If he will not stand up to strike, or at all events to cheer, for the good great cause which is now in fierce debate upon the banks of the Potomac, he will never have the heart and soul to face the red tempest for the cause that is still more desperately in peril.
I remain, my dear Treanor,
Ever faithfully your friend,
THOS. FRANCIS MEAGHER.
To B. S. TREANOR, Esq., Boston.
A DAY OF PRAYER.
In accordance with the request of a joint committee of Congress. President Lincoln has issued a proclamation, recommending Thursday, September 26th, as a day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer. He states, in general terms, what it is desirable the people should pray for.
If we are expected to join in that days supplications, we shall be under the necessity of making our prayer more specific.
We would pray that effectual means might be taken to ascertain whether William H. Seward has forgotten the text of his Rochester speech, and if so, that he be provided with a printed copy-pasted in his hat-and that he be taught to repeat the words, irrepressible conflict, till he will not be likely so soon again to forget their significance.
We would next pray for a thorough purging of all the departments, of disloyal and unprincipled men, filling their places with the good and true, so far as possible.
Having thus prayed all the tories and rebels out of the camp, we would implore the bestowment upon the remaining officers, from President to the least subordinate, of a necessary amount of strength in their spines, intelligence in their foreheads, well-directed force in their back brain, and an over-powering love of freedom and right to crown the whole.
Lastly, we would pray that the commander-in-chief might cause every army banner to be inscribed with Freedom for the Slave," and, instead of a national pray day, there be appointed a national day of deliverance from bondage.
Even the prayer-hearing God of the Christians would prefer the song of deliverance from four millions of bondmen, to the groans and tears, humiliation and prayers of thirty millions of freemen. And if not, it is no reason why every sinner, from Abraham Lincoln down to the writer of this paragraph, should, not forsake his sin before he prays to be forgiven.-Herald of Progress.

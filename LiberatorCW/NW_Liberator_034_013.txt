PART MATERIALS.
One of the radical papers makes a furious onslaught upon Gen. MeClellan, taking it for granted that he is a candidate for the Presidency, and enumerating the various classes of men who will vote for him. The paper in question seems to consider it a conclusive argument against a man's good character, if another man of doubtful character would vote for him.
It remains to be seen whether Gen. McClellan will ever be a candidate for the votes of the people; but since the classification of voters is thus attempted by the radicals, with their usual recklessness of truth and of decency, it is but just to look on the other side of the picture, and see who now sustain the Administration, and who will be likely to vote for its renewal of power, or for the candidate of the dominant party, whoever he may be.
In the first place, a large number of intelligent, sincere and true partriots. It is idle to deny to either party the possession of such men. We place these foremost among the supporters of the Administration, although the radical press is too liberal and abusive to grant, for a moment, that there are any such in the conservative party. The simple truth is, that the great body of both political parties is made up of the honest faithful, loyal men of America, who differ widely, but sincerely, as they have an inalienable right to differ, on questions of public policy. If none but these men voted, the nation might claim a lease of power and life for many centuries.
But, beside these, there will be found among the Administration supporters every shoddy contractor who has coined the blood of our soldiers into gold for his pockets, every man who has sold disease and death in the form of provisions, every man who has cheated the government out of its money in selling munitions of war, ships, steamboats, and other material. The vote of these men will be heavy, and with it will be all the voters they can buy, or force into joining them. Every man who wants the war continued indefinitely, because he is making money and doing a prosperous business, will vote that ticket. Every man who, with the New York Tribune, calls the flag of the Union a "flaunting lie," and the American eagle "a goose," will vote that ticket. A number of men who, with the Tribune, believe that if the Declaration of Independence "justified the secession from the British empire of three million of colonists in 1776," they "do not see why it would not justify the secession of five millions of Southrons from the Union in 1861,"will vote that ticket. All the men who attended the meeting in Syracuse, at which the Union was voted a failure, and resolutions adopted to open a correspondence with Henry A. Wise and others, to promote a dissolution of the Union, will vote that ticket. All the men who got up and attended a similar meeting in Worcester will vote that ticket. All the men who believe the Constitution of the United States "a league with death and a covenant with hell," will vote that ticket. All the men who sustain the war only so long as it is a war against slavery, and refuse to sustain it when it is a war for the Union, will vote that ticket. All the white men who amalgamate with the negroes will vote that ticket. All the men who, with Parker and other apostles of abolitionism, believe Christ no better than a Boston abolitionist will vote that ticket. Robbers of the public purse, men fattening on the blood of the people, infidels, apostates, a heterogeneous company of strange-visaged and strange-minded men, radical, fanatic, enemies of the law of God and the law of man, will be found sustaining the same candidate, whoever he may be.
Now what does all this amount to? We have made the list brief, but it serves to show that if the conservative party is to be abused as the Tribune abuses it, there is ample material for retort. But this can be said of the conservative vote, which cannot of the radical vote, that every man who sustains the ticket will be a lover of the old American Union and a defender of the American Constitution. Of all sorts and kinds of creeds, the conservative party will be one in patriotic love, in deep, earnest devotion to the Union which Washington founded. And it will appear as clear as noonday before long, that if the nation is to come out of this war united, saved, it will be only by the will of the people sustaining the conservative candidate, whoever he may be.
The issue is fast becoming the simple issue of Union with conservative principles, or Chaos with radical principles. The old Union, the old Constitution, the old principles which Mr. Bates so eloquently, and with so much pathos, spoke of in the letter we yesterday published, are the true objects of patriotic devotion now. There are bad men in all political parties. But whether the party principles are bad or good, this is the question which each man must ask in determining how he will vote in the coming election. Nor are these principles determined alone by the platforms or resolutions adopted at conventions and in Congress. The radical party has deceived the people once and again. They pledged themselves to sustain the doctrine of the Crittenden resolutions, and when the country was involved in the war, they rejected those resolutions and plunged into the deepest abyss, out of which those principles would have kept us. They are to-day acting on the principles of secession, sustaining the Southern heresy that States could destroy themselves as members of the Union by acts of secession. There is no hope of saving the country by their plans. But there is hope, if the people think calmly and act as wise patriots this fall.-New York Journal of Commerce.

KENTUCKY.
The patriotic men of this brave old State see, with perhaps more clearness of vision than any others in the country, the madness which controls the Washington Administration,and the ruin toward which it is conducting the country. The Louisville Journal, a paper against whose loyalty none but an abolitionist slanderer will venture to say a word, thus justly sums up a history of the betrayal of the people by the party in power:-
"The Republican party, with Mr. Lincoln at its head, has repudiated alike the Crittenden Resolution, the Chicago platform, and the Constitution of the Union. It has made a clean sweep of all its solemn engagements to the people. It has forsworn itself and betrayed the nation. In order to get into power, the Republican party pledged itself to maintain, inviolate, the constitutional rights of the States, and, in order to collect a mighty army, it renewed the pledge; but, now that it has got into power and has collected a mighty army, it tears its pledge to shreds, and tramples the constitutional rights of the States in the dust."
It is no wonder that the loyal men of Kentucky repudiate all connection with the party which has violated every pledge made to the people, and whose present object is manifestly no longer the preservation of the Union, but solely the perpetuation of their own power. Kentucky will receive no mercy at the hands of the radicals hereafter, since her Union men resolve to send delegates to the Democratic Conven-
<c02>
tion. But the Democratic Convention is the only Union Convention to be held at the North this summer. The Baltimore Convention will not dare adopt a resolution in favor of the Constitution and Union. Its members will be pledged to disunion and a new government.-N. Y. Journal of Commerce.

LETTERS FROM ENGLAND. NO. VII.
BIOGRAPHY OF GEO. THOMPSON, ESQ.
BY WILLIAM FARMER, ESQ.
In 1847, Mr. Thompson was urged to allow himself to be nominated as a candidate for the representation of the Tower Hamlets in Parliament. Some years previously, he had stood a fierce but unsuccessful contest for the representation of the pro-slavery town of Southampton, in conjunction with Lord Nugent, a scion of the Ducal House of Buckingham. Mr. Thompson's primary object in consenting to go into the House of Commons was a desire to serve the cause of liberalism generally; but along with that, be had a specialty-a wish to promote a reform in the administration of the affairs of that most misgoverned country, British India. When he entered upon the contest, the odds were apparently against him. He was the idol of the unenfranchised masses, but the rulers did not like him. The public house, and other vested interests were arrayed against him; but, nevertheless, he defeated his opponent, General Fox, an illegitimate son of the late Lord Holland, who singularly enough had married an illegitimate daughter of King William the Fourth, by the celebrated actress Mrs. Jordan. Mr. Thompson's majority, 3668, was the largest by which any member had been returned to Parliament. It is a singular fact, that his opponent was proposed by Sir Edward North Buxton, a son of his old friend Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton. Mr. Thompson's speech on the hustings on the day of nomination will never be forgotten by those who heard it. In reply to a scurrilous bill headed, "Who is George Thompson?" he referred to the father of the young baronet near him in such a manner as to cause the latter to burst into tears. The returning officer, Mr. Child, had been a youthful colleague of Mr. Thompson, at the city of London Literary and Scientific Institution, and now he was powerfully affected at having, in the march of events, the proud duty of declaring the friend of his boyhood member of Parliament for the largest borough in the kingdom, containing nearly half a million of inhabitants. A man who serves his country faithfully in Parliament must make great sacrifices in so doing. Such was the case with Mr. Thompson. He did not, like a government hack, invest his money in a seat, as a simple commercial speculation, for the attainment of an ulterior purpose, the realization of which will bring him back capital and usurious interest. His political creed placed him out of the pale of governmental patronage. Our politicians are divided into three classes: Tories, Whigs and Radicals. The first two comprise the "ins” and "outs" of office; the chances of obtaining ministerial position by the last is very remote. Mr. Thompson had the boldness to avow his adherence to the most democratic measure of electoral reform ever submitted to Parliament, called "The People's Charter," although he knew that his open advocacy of that measure in the House of Commons would arouse the hostility of the bulk of his middle-class constituents. It has been said that his parliamentary career was a failure; that upon the floor of the Senate he found his level. The testimony of a leading member of that assembly to me was, that he never knew a man make for himself such a good position in the House in so short a time as Mr. Thompson had done. This is further evidenced by the fact that the ministers frequently solicited him to speak in support of measures of national interest. 
The next event of importance in his history was his second visit to the United States in 1850, the prolongation of which beyond the period originally intended, no doubt cost him his seat for the Tower Hamlets. Large constituencies are capricious; for there is no doubt that the offence of having been absent from his parliamentary duties for a period of five months, ought to have been condoned in consideration of the great work he was doing in the cause of freedom in the United States. Had he been yachting about the Mediterranean, his rejection would have been reasonable. The Southern assertion, that his defeat was a tacit censure of his anti-slavery principles is as false as it is foolish. At every one of the numerous crowded meetings of his constituents held by him on his return, his anti-slavery labors were commended by distinct resolution. It would be needless for me to recapitulate his important labors daring his eight months' residence in America at that time-of the important services he rendered in silencing the rowdies who tried to silence him, and his establishing the right of free speech. Having been relieved of his parliamentary duties, be again devoted himself to the cause of the slave. One of the most memorable speeches be delivered was at Bristol; a report of which was read with thrilling effect for several days to thousands of his old constituents upon Bishop Bonner's Fields. In 1853 the great Anti-Slavery Conference was held at Manchester, under his auspices and that of Parker Pillsbury. Ten years he labored gratuitously in the cause of Parliamentary reform, in conjunction with Sir Joshua Walmsley and the leading Liberals of Great Britain. Although apparently unsuccessful, there is no doubt that the seed then sown will produce its appropriate harvest. The ignis faluus of an apprehended foreign invasion has deluded the people from the safe path of reform. The diversion of playing at volunteer soldiers has for a time beguiled a large portion of the people from their only true security for good government-the making representation coextensive with taxation. When the agitation for Parliamentary reforms is renewed, as it will be some day, we shall sadly miss Mr. Thompson's services, should he be absent from England at that time. America has an interest in common with England in that reform; for in proportion as the aristocratic predominance is lessened, and the democratic is increased in our legislature, will be the probability of the continuance of the good understanding between the governments and the peoples of Great Britain and the United States. 
In 1856, Mr. Thompson paid his second visit to ,India. On this occasion he became the honored guest of two Governor Generals, Lords Canning and Dalhousie. In the midst of his labors he was, unhappily, stricken down by the climate, and returned home, to all appearance a helpless paralytic; but the apprehensions that his friends entertained of his life were happily dispelled, and it pleased Providence to restore him once more to health and usefulness. From that time until the beginning of 1859, his labors were continually devoted to the vindication of the American Abolitionists, whose reputation was persistently assailed by
<c03>
misrepresentations privately circulated, for the slanderers never ventured to do their work upon public platforms. From the breaking out of the Southern rebellion to the present time, his labors in support of the Federal cause generally, and of the anti-slavery policy of the Government specially, have been incessant. His intimate knowledge of American history, and of every phase of the antecedent struggle which has been going on for the last thirty years in the United States, has been invaluable. The American people are greatly indebted to Cairnes, Noel, Goldwin Smith, Professor Newman, Washington Wilks, Newman Hall and others, for the influence they have exercised in the rectification of opinion in this country upon the true issues involved in the pending struggle between the legitimate government and the rebels, but they are under incomparably greater obligation to George Thompson for his services in the same cause. Since the election of Mr. Lincoln, to the present time, he has attended numerous meetings in all parts of the kingdom. To what extent the pro-slavery leaven might have extended but for such counteracting influences, it is impossible to say. Where men will not take the trouble to investigate facts, they are at the mercy of any sinister influence they may be exposed to. Dr. Watts has forcibly, although perhaps not very elegantly, described the process of the transformation of so many men, who are not naturally fiends, into copperheads:
"One scabby sheep infects the flock,
And poisons all the rest."
During the last twenty years, Mr. Thompson's house has almost constantly been the home of fugitive slaves, who have received from him not only refuge, but advice and pecuniary assistance. If the slave becomes, as there is no doubt he will, the independent freeman, he will no longer need eleemosynary support in this country, inasmuch as he will find a far better field for his labor in America than he can do in England. One colored man living a lazy or vagabond life in this country will do more to injure the African race in popular estimation, than any arguments or facts adduced in its favor can benefit it.
Such are some of the leading incidents of Mr. Thompson's public life, in duration extending over one-third of a century. The contrast between the social and political phases of society then and now would be extremely interesting, and highly encouraging to pioneers in the cause of reform. In many respects the change amounts to a complete but gradual and peaceable political revolution. Neither do I propose to attempt to measure the large share which Mr. Thompson has had in bringing about these glorious results. A firm faith in the ultimate triumph of righteousness in the world's government, however evil may from time to time, for certain periods, predominate over the good, is an inevitable result, of the retrospect in the mind of every rational man. In the past of the world's life there ever has been a "good time coming"; although it is not always that the forerunners are privileged to witness the advent of the Messiah by whom it is introduced; and in the future there are good times to come still, despite the venal apostacy of Charles Mackay, from freedom to slavery. The life of George Thompson, moreover, furnishes to all, and especially to the young, a most valuable lesson upon the propriety of relying, with implicit confidence, in all the great moral enterprises of life, upon the sustaining power of high moral and religious principle. During his career, he was exposed to frequent temptations to which a man of temporizing policy and average moral strength would have succumbed; but from the top of the high mountain to which he was carried, George Thompson always had faith enough to reply to the tempter, "Get thee hence, Satan!" Amidst all the trials and difficulties to which he has been exposed, he has come off victorious; and there would be no impiety in his biographer applying to him the figurative language of the apocalypse regarding his great exemplar-" And on his head were many crowns." If, like certain heroes, he were to be called from the battle-field to the throne of empire, he would have entitled himself to a similar election to that of Anastatius, who was called to the imperial purple by the acclamations of the people-"Reign as thou hast lived!" But, however much of the moral dignitate may invest his brow, there has not been laid up any of the materials for securing the otium to accompany it. This never has been, and never will be his own work. He has achieved his country's independence, but he has no little Caprera, with its olives, vineyards and fishing shore to retire to. For thirty-three years he has labored, almost without intermission, for the abolition of British Colonial slavery; for the development of the resources of British India, and to secure justice to its oppressed populations; for the emancipation of industry by the establishment of free trade and the repeal of the corn laws; for the extension of the social and political rights of his countrymen; and for the abolition of the slavery under which four millions of American bondmen were groaning: and yet having lived to see the accomplishment of these objects, at the end of his brilliant career, he finds himself with less of this world's goods than are possessed by thousands of tradesmen in the humblest line of business. Were he to die to-morrow, he would leave to his family nothing but his name and fame. Upon leaving England, he may address his countrymen in the language of Paul's valedictory address to the elders at Miletus-" And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto America, not knowing the things that shall befall me there. I take you to record this day that I am free from the blood of all men. I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them that were with me." Such is the position of a man who has rendered such eminent public services to his countrymen and the world, and who, on the 18th of next June, will have completed his sixth decade. Although American slavery has not yet received its final coup de grace, yet it is now in its death-struggle; and although a righteous government is not yet established in India, the elements of its regeneration are working slowly but surely; so that, with respect to all the great works in which he has been so prominently engaged, he may claim to have complied with the injunction “Ad finem esto fidelis";-be thou faithful to the end. Nevertheless, it has not been given to him to enter into the beatitude, "Beatus ille qui procul negotiis";-blessed are they that retire from toil. If Providence vouchsafe to him many years of life and health, his motto still will be, although not in its epicurean construction, "Dum vivavus vivamus;"-live while you live. His worst detractors cannot charge upon him! a discrepancy between his faith and his morals. He needs no orthodox whitewash, like that will which Isaac, the Archbishop, sought to conceal the vices of King Artisires:-" Our king is certainly too much addicted to licentious pleasures, but he has been purified by the holy waters of baptism. True, he is a lover of mammon; hut he does not adore the fire and the elements. He may deserve the reproach of lewdness, but he is an undoubted Catholic, and his faith is pure, though his manners are flagitious." Events will evoke for George Thomp-
<c04>
son that which they have wrung for William Lloyd Garrison and the erst despised American Abolitionists-the homage of their bitterest opponents. Nearly three years ago, Beresford Hope's venomous print, the Saturday Review, was compelled thus to bear testimony to the efficacy of the labors of the American proscrits:- "Every taunt and boast of the seceders, each disdainful rejection of the overtures of peace which proceed from the now timid Northerners, must add plausibility to the arguments of those who have always contended that there could be no peace with the slave-owner. There are men of much eloquence, and consequently of much influence, in the Northern States, who, though Americans born, have steadily refused to take the oath of allegiance to the Federal Constitution, lest they should seem to pledge themselves against undertaking a root and branch extirpation of slavery, if they should ever have it in their power. A year ago, such persons, though to a certain extent admired and listened to, were regarded by the Republicans as dangerous allies, and by the mass of the people as half-mad incendiaries, but now, that events are apparently tending to bring about the state of things which they always declared to be inevitable, it is not wonderful that increasing numbers of Americans should be tempted to look upon them as prophets."
Thus has it ever been in the world's history-the visionary of to-day is the prophet of tomorrow. Seneca still more strikingly states the same truth, which the history of the Abolitionists is now so strikingly verifying:-"Often times, the mistaking a noble purpose has drawn reproach upon its author, and many great men have been cursed for devils in their lives, whom succeeding ages have venerated as divine." Your apotheosis, as well as that of George Thompson, and the faithful band of confessors for anti-slavery truth, who have worked with you, is not likely to be left to succeeding ages; you will find a place in the pantheon of philanthropic demigods ere yet the grave has closed over your mortal remains; and the very men who have sought your lives will be the first to offer incense at your fane. Ere long-it may be months, it may be years; for in the history of nations, "short" and "long" are relative terms, and the times and seasons are in the hands of God-the eloquent language of Curran will be applied to America:-"Liberty is commensurate with and inseparable from the American soil. American law proclaims, even to the stranger and the sojourner, the moment he sets his foot upon American earth, that the ground on which he treads is holy, and consecrated by the Genius of Universal Emancipation. No matter in what language his doom may have been pronounced;-no matter what complexion, incompatible with freedom, an Indian or an African sun may have burnt upon him;-no matter in what disastrous battle his liberty may have been cloven down;-no matter with what solemnities he may have been devoted upon the altar of slavery; the first moment he touches the sacred soil of America, the altar and the god sink together in the dust; his soul walks abroad in her own majesty; his body swells beyond the measure of his chains, that burst from around him; and he stands redeemed, regenerated, and disenthralled, by the irresistible Genius of Universal Emancipation."
London, 1864.

HENRY OLAY AND W. L. GARRISON.
From the Boston Transcript.
Will my friend Haskell allow me a brief space in his paper for a personal explanation?
The editor of the Louisville (Ky.) Journal, in an article an the release of the editor of the Liberator from prison in Baltimore, in 1830, makes the following statement:-
"Mr. Clay related to us the facts in July, 1830. A few months before, Mr. Garrison, editor of an emancipation paper in Baltimore, was prosecuted, imprisoned, and fined for a libel on Woolfolk. Not being able to pay the fine, his imprisonment was prolonged on that account. Mr. Whittier, an entire stranger to Mr. Clay, wrote to him as a philanthropist, begging him to pay the fine, and thus procure Mr. Garrison's release. Mr. Clay wrote to his old friend, Hezekiah Niles of Niles’s Register asking whether Mr. Garrison was a worthy man, and saying that, if he was so, he would pay one-half the fine, provided Mr. Niles or others would pay the other half. Mr. Niles wrote back, stating that, on the whole, he thought Mr. Garrison worthy. Mr. Clay at once remitted the money for half of the fine, the other half was paid, and Garrison was discharged.
It is not pleasant to have to add, that some time afterwards, both Whittier and Garrison wrote bitter things against Mr. Clay." 
The facts in the case are simply these: during the imprisonment of my friend Garrison, I ventured to address a line to Henry Clay, asking him to use his influence with his political and personal friends in Baltimore to procure his release. I neither asked nor expected him to pay himself the fine and costs. I had no definite idea upon what terms, if at all, his release could be effected, or whether, in the words of Dumbedikes to Jeanie Deans, "Siller would do it." My appeal, wisely or otherwise, was made to a distinguished political man in behalf of one of his most ardent supporters, who must have been already known to him as the first editor in New England to nominate him for the Presidency, in an able; and vigorous article published in the Bennington (Vt.) Journal of the Times, of March 27,1829, and which was widely copied and commended. It is proper to say that my letter was written without the knowledge of my friend Garrison.
In a letter which I received some time after from the Kentucky statesman, he informed me that he had written to a friend in Baltimore, in conformity with my wishes; but that he had just learned from his correspondent that he had been anticipated, and that the liberation, had been effected without the aid he would otherwise have given. The fine and costs were in fact paid by Arthur Tappan, Esq., of New York.
The promptness of Henry Clay's response to my appeal was honorable in itself, and characteristic of one who was always true to his political and personal friends. The implied charge of ingratitude suggested by my old friend Prentice is perhaps hardly worth noticing. What Henry Clay proposed to do for Garrison was no more than be would have done, and should have done, for any one who bad established a similar claim upon his favor. As to myself, I could scarcely be said to be an "entire stranger" to him; for young and obscure as I was, I had in the Boston Manufacturer advocated his claims with such zeal and earnestness, that I was selected as the successor of the editor of the journal himself, and in the Hartford (Ct.) "N. E. Review" assisted, as he will doubtless remember, in writing "The Life of Henry Clay," and declined on account of illness an invitation from the National Republican Committee to fill a vacancy in the delegation of Connecticut to the Convention which nominated him in 1831. I mention this merely to show that my letter, under the circumstances, was not altogether boyish presumption.
That, in the progress of the great struggle between Freedom and Slavery, both Garrison and myself have
<c05>
since felt compelled to speak freely of the position and avowed sentiments of Henry Clay, is certainly true. But for myself, I can say that this was always done more in sorrow than in anger, and accompanied with a profound regret that one in many respects so noble, and endowed with such wonderful gifts, should allow his great influence to be felt in support of a system which his reason and conscience condemned.

THE FURY IN RICHMOND. 
The language in which the Richmond journals speak of the recent dash of General Kilpatrick illustrates strikingly the evil effects of slavery upon the manners and morals of the masters. The insolence of their tone, the malignant cruelty of their suggestions, the satisfaction they express at the outrages perpetrated upon the bodies of Colonel Dahlgren and others, dead or living, but alike defenceless; all these show how the nature of these men has been warped by their contact with slavery. The same passions which are excited in their minds by intercourse with their servile dependants, and which can be gratified without fear of punishment upon their helpless bodies, these same vile and devilish passions flame forth under other circumstances: they cannot help speaking to their equals as they do to their slaves, and using the same cruelties in war which they practice on the plantation. "This day's sun should not go down before every scoundrel taken in this assassin’s work is blown to atoms from the mouths of cannon, and every means should be employed to get the names of as many as possible of those who have escaped, so that, it taken hereafter, they may be treated in the same way," says the Richmond Whig; and again: "If our authorities were prepared to act as the interests of the cause and the dignity of the country imperatively demand, it would make no difference if there were disguised officers among the privates, since an indiscriminate execution would reach all." The Despatch adds: "There is no way to meet this kind of warfare but by the most summary punishment of every man, caught in the act of its prosecution. Every commander under whose authority such deeds are committed should be put to death immediately he is caught, and his criminality clearly established."
<c06>
Colonel Dahlgren’s dead and mutilated body was buried, but dug up again, so the Richmond papers report, by the orders of the authorities, and shamefully misused. The prisoners captured have been illused and threatened, and it is urged that they shall be killed.
Such blind fury and cruelty prove the barbarizing influences of slavery; they show that if this system had endured for fifty years longer, it might have dragged this whole continent back into savagery; for all who come within the reach of this extirpator of humane sentiments are turned by its companionship into brutes. Slavery has made these slaveholders treacherous-as is shown by their conspiracy against the Union, the government of which they were at the time carrying on; it has made them liars-as when Beauregard charged General McClellan with issuing a "beauty and booty" proclamation, and as now in Richmond they have forged a paper of instructions, and report it to have been found upon Colonel Dahlgren. Slavery has made them cruel-they hunt escaped prisoners and loyal citizens with bloodhounds; it has made them inordinately vain-they charge cowardice upon their opponents, and believe themselves to be the only brave, pure, and high-minded people in the world. Slavery has infested them with the vices-cunning, treachery, blind conceit, ignorance, a furious and suspicions temper, childish petulance, unscrupulous mendacity-which distinguish a semi-civilized or barbarous community. In this war they have exhibited all these vices.
To hear these slave-lords, one would think they never recommended such "raids" as Kilpatrick’s, as their favorite mode of warfare. To listen to their angry threats, we should forget-as they appear to have forgotten-the marches and exploits of Stuart, and Morgan, and Wheeler, Mosby, Quantrell and Forrest. Kilpatrick is only worthy of an ignominious death, but John Morgan, who in half-a-dozen expeditions devastated Kentucky, receives all honor and glory. It is a crime against humanity to make a dash at Richmond, but when Quantrell burned Lawrence and massacred in cold blood the unresisting inhabitants, the rebels called his exploit a great victory and him a gallant soldier, a terror to Yankees. These very people who now cry out so furiously were the inventors of these raids; they magnified for two years the heroism and splendid achievements of their cavalry generals, whose sole business was to make such incursions. And now that they are no longer successful in this their favorite branch of war, now that Quantrell, Jackson and others can no longer ravage Missouri and burns towns in Kansas-districts entirely beyond the legitimate field of war; that Morgan and Forrest can no more get into Kentucky to tear up railroads, destroy and carry off cattle and horses, and burn mills and stores-these people cry out with childish and disgraceful petulance, "unfair"-as some half-grown boy begins to whimper and sneak out of the game which he has begun when he is unexpectedly beaten at it.-New York Evening Post.
Here is what the Richmond Examiner says, with fiendish exultation, in regard to the savage treatment of the body of Col. Dahlgren:-
Dahlgren's body was boxed up at Walkerton on Sunday, and brought to Richmond, with the object, we understand, of its positive identification, and the establishment of the fact of the finding of the infamous documents upon it, all of which has been attested by witnesses. Henceforth the name of Dahlgren is linked with eternal infamy, and in the years to come defenceless woman and innocent childhood will peruse, with a sense of shrinking horror, the story of Richmond's rescue from the midnight sack and ravage led by Dahlgren. It would seem something of the curse he came to bestow upon others lighted upon his own carcass, when it fell riddled by avenging Southern bullets. Stripped, robbed of every valuable, the fingers cut off for the sake of the diamond rings that encircled them, when the body was found by those who were sent in charge of it, it was lying in a field, stark-naked, with the exception of the stockings. Some humane persons had lifted the corpse from the pike, and thrown it over into the field, to save it from the hogs. The artificial leg worn by Dahlgren was removed, and is now at Gen. Elzey’s headquarters. It is of most beautiful design and finish. Yesterday afternoon the body was removed from the car that brought it to the York River Railroad depot, and given to the spot of earth selected to receive it. Where that spot is, no one bat those concerned in its burial know, or care to tell. It was a dog’s burial, without coffin, winding sheet or service. Friends and relatives at the North need inquire no further; this is all they will know-he is buried a burial that befitted the mission upon which became. He has "swept through the city of Richmond" on a pine bier, and “written his name" on the scroll of infamy, instead of "on the hearts of his countrymen," never to be erased. He "asked the blessing of Almighty God" on his mission of rapine, murder and blood, and the Almighty cursed him instead.-Richmond Examiner of March 8.

INHUMAN BARBARITIES OF THE REBELS.
A correspondent of the Chattanooga Gazette furnishes the following horrible account of rebel cruelties practised upon an Alabama Unionist:
In 1861, a Unionist was forcibly arrested by a mob at his house in Randolph county, Alabama, and marched off into an adjoining thicket. The mob here rifled him of his pocket-book, boots and coat, tied him, and held a consultation to determine his fate. It was soon determined to "put him in the tories' yoke;" but, first of all, to try to make him acknowledge to having done and said things of which he was innocent.
After trying some time to accomplish their object, by questioning and threatening, they resorted to more severe measures. Untying him, they took off his clothing, laid him down upon a log, lashed him firmly to it, and with large hickory switches commenced lacerating him. Four let in on him at once, and their number soon increased to six. They continued to beat him there for a long time, pausing occasionally, and asking him if he would confess, and upon his refusing would let in on him more vigorously.
The blood trickled from his back in streams. His piteous appeals in behalf of mercy were totally disregarded. Nature finally yielded, and the poor man swooned and was lost to consciousness for several minutes. As soon as be revived, these hellish tormentors resumed their tortures. They split the end of green sticks, and twisting them in his hair and pulling them violently, caused the most excruciating pain. This and other fiendish operations were continued for some time. They then cut off all his fingers at the second joint, as also his oars, close up to his head.
The next step was to cut off his arms at the elbows, and the legs at the knees. After this operation the wretched victim fainted, and failing to recover for several minutes, the murderers pronounc
"Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land, to all the inhabitants thereof."
"I lay this down as the law of nations. I say that military authority takes, for the time, the place of all municipal institutions, and SLAVERY AMONG THE REST; and that, under that state of things, so far from its being true that the States where slavery exists have the exclusive management of the subject, not only the PRESIDENT or THE UNITED STATES, but the COMMANDER OF THE ARMY, HAS POWER TO ORDER THE UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION OF THE SLAVES. From the instant that the slaveholding States become the theatre of a war, CIVIL, servile, or foreign, from that instant the war powers of CONGRESS extend to interference with the institution of slavery, IN EVERY WAY IN WHICH IT CAN BE INTERFERED WITH, from a claim of indemnity for slaver taken or destroyed, to the cession of States, burdened with slavery, to a foreign power. ... It is a war power. I say it is a war power; and when your country is actually in war, whether it be a war of invasion or a war of insurrection, Congress has power to <illegible> on the war, and MUST CARRY IT ON, ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF WAR; and by the laws of war, an invaded country has all its laws and municipal institutions swept by the board, and MARTIAL POWER TAKES THE PLACE OF THEM. When two hostile armies are set in martial array, the commanders of both armies have power to emancipate all the slaves in the invaded territory."—J.Q.ADAMS.

ed him dead, and began to prepare to leave, but at this moment their victim showed signs of life.
They now tied a rope round his neck, and hung him to a limb near by, and instantly decamped, leaving him suspended between the heavens and the earth.
The third day afterwards, the body was discovered, taken down, and decently interred by friends.

WENDELL PHILLIPS AT MONTPELIER.
The Green Mountain Freeman speaks as follows of a lecture recently delivered at Montpelier by Wendell Phillips:—
Mr. Phillips commenced to speak about half past seven o'clock, and held the audience with the charm and power of his fascinating eloquence two hours. His subject was “Reconstruction,” or the only way to an enduring peace. Of course he believes in fighting as one step toward peace, breaking the military power of the rebellion by battles like those to Grant’s Vicksburg and Chattanooga; but this he regards as but a part, and the least difficult part of the way to peace. He believes in destroying the power of the aristocratic class in the South for further mischief; and this he said could only be done by destroying slavery root and branch, treating the negro as a man, putting education into his head and a ballot into his hand, giving him land, and then, with a free Democracy like that of New England established all over the South, let the questions of superiority and inferiority of races settle themselves. The South, he declared, must be planted with New England Democratic men, carrying with them New England Democratic laws recognizing the inalienable rights of all, before the nations could settle down into an abiding peace. In the course of the discussion, and near the close of his lecture, in an open, frank criticism of Mr. Lincoln’s course, he expressed without any bitterness, or seventy of denunciation, the opinion that Mr. Lincoln was not advancing rapidly enough, or going deep enough, in his anti-slavery policy. We think the audience agreed with Mr. Phillips in every point of his argument, except his objection to Mr. Lincoln, and no one could reasonably complain of the spirit and temper in which he set forth those objections.
Of course we have given no idea of the lecture in the above brief sketch, and even a verbatim report would be tame beside the living, breathing eloquence of Mr. Phillips. His easy, quiet, graceful, and infinitely varied style, his most perfect and polished elocution, and the simplicity, transparent clearness, and logical force of his address gave it a wonderful charm; and while bearing him, we doubt whether a person in the audience who had not heard him before did not change his opinion of WENDELL PHILLIPS, and come to the conclusion that he had been strangely maligned and misrepresented by those who, for lack of ability to answer his arguments, have fallen into the habit of abusing the man.

GEN. BANKS IN NEW ORLEANS.
The Burlington Free Press, in some severe strictures upon Wendell Phillip's lecture at Burlington, makes the following allusion to Mr. Phillip's criticisms upon the labor system inaugurated by Gen. Banks in Louisiana:
"When Mr. Phillips’s attempts to make a Vermont audience believe that N P. Banks is a tool in the hands of Louisiana slaveholders and secessionists, he is spitting against the wind. Our people have far more confidence in the fidelity of the cause of free labor of the mechanic who has worked his way to such high places of power and trust, and in the philanthropy of the General who lifted the tired little slave girl on to his cannon, than they have in Mr. Phillips’s statement.” 
Our purpose in calling attention to this paragraph in the Free Press is not to defend Mr. Phillips, as that orator will doubtless survive this newspaper attack, as he has many similar and some more ferocious and dangerous ones, but to ask the Free Press —which is an able paper, and a candid one when its feelings are not too much excited—on what ground it defends Gen. Banks’s labor system? The colored persons, whom Gen. Banks apprentices to those who were but recently slaveholders, for very small wages, are either free or slaves. If they are slaves, Gen. Banks cannot be entitled to much praise for continuing their servitude; and if they are free men, will the Free. Press give us and its readers the authority under which Gen. Banks acts? What right has Gen. Banks to apprentice a free colored man any more than a free white man? Gen. Banks may have been a mechanic, and entitled to great credit for having worked his way up from that position to his present one, where he lets out, by the hundred and thousand, men as free as himself, but we submit that the fact that he was a mechanic is not a sufficient justification of his present course. We trust the Free Press will favor us with some additional reasons for its faith in him.—Green Mountain Freeman.
 
AN INSTRUCTIVE REBEL LETTER.
RICHMOND, 26, 1864.
HON. J. B. HANCOCK: 
DEAR SIR—I wish I had to-day a glass of your excellent wine, as I feel somewhat languid and fatigued after my multiplied and incessant duties here. I hope some day to drink the health of our young nation, and talk over our “hair-breadth escapes” and great tribulations. The present hour looks gloomy, to be sure; but, like yourself, I believe in ultimate success. To give us this success, we want to strike an effective blow early in the spring. This will set us on our legs again. Doubtless the Federals will open the campaign by moving a heavy column upon Atlanta, Ga., and at the same time a heavy one from Knoxville, in the direction of Southwestern Virginia and Northern North Carolina. This latter, if- not repelled, will force upon Gen. Lee the necessity of falling back from his present position, it may be from Richmond, and almost entirely from Virginia, to prevent himself from being flanked, and his army from being entirely disbanded. You can see at once if this movement be allowed to succeed, that these consequences must follow. This portion of Virginia is pretty well eaten out, and if Lee’s army were cut off from the South, it could not be provisioned for three months. Pressed in front, and harassed in rear, with provisions exhausted, disbandment and destruction must follow.
It then becomes a matter of the first moment to guard the rear of the army of the Potomac.
Should the movement upon Atlanta succeed, then Georgia will be laid waste, and our chief source (at present) of provisions be cut off. No man can look forward to spring without great apprehensions. Doubtless our severest trials will then be upon us. If we sustain ourselves, or more, if we gain any signal advantage over the enemy soon after the opening of the campaign, we may give the opposition elements of the North a chance to combine and beat Lincoln for President. This I should hail at a good omen, and begin to think of peace at no very distant day. I see no chance for peace until the Republican party is beaten and overcome. In the meantime things are assuming a more unfavorable aspect in North Carolina. Her course is deeply humiliating to every patriotic heart. Congress is laboring diligently to strengthen our army and improve our currency. I hope we shall succeed materially in accomplishing both of these ends. The remedy is a severe one, but the disease is desperate, and no silly nostrum will answer. The cause is the people’s, and they must sustain it at all hazards, and the representative who falters in this hour of trial is not worthy of confidence. I would tell you what measures we are likely to adopt, but that would be constrained, as our proceedings are in secret session.
As ever, your friend, most truly,
O. R. SINGLETON.

MR. CHASE'S WITHDRAWAL.
That virulent Copperhead sheet, the New York World, shows in the following comments upon Mr. Chase's withdrawal from the presidential arena what are to be the tactics of Copperheadism to divide the Republican house, and defeat Mr. Lincoln:—
Mr. CHASE'S apparently voluntary, but really compulsory, withdrawal (for when his own State had declared for LINCOLN, he had not a leg,. nor even a crutch, to stand upon) makes a clear field for General FREMONT, as the anti-Lincoln candidate in the Republican party. CHASE had neither the vigorous decision of character which would enable him, nor the freedom from official restraints which would permit him, nor the unmerited personal grievance which would justify him, in a sharp preliminary canvass against his official chief. FREMONT has all these, Besides, he is a military man, and will be more accept-
<c02>
able to the soldiers than CHASE could be. And, what is still better for him as a Republican, anti-Lincoln candidate, his relations to the emancipation question, both on the score of priority and of unhesitating boldness, are much more acceptable to the thick-and-thin radicals than those of any other possible candidate. CHASE'S anti-slavery radicalism it not identified with any conspicuous public act, like that of FREMONT.
No class of the Republicans can make any objection to FREMONT which will not either answer itself or recoil against the objectors. If doubts are cast upon his personal availability or popularity, his friends have a ready reply in the splendid run he made in 1856 while the Republican party was yet in the gristle of its infancy. If the Democrats who have since come into the party object to him, was not he also a Democrat before he became a Republican? and has not the Whig wing of the party thus far had the lion's share of the offices?
FREMONT'S strength will now be rapidly developed, and will make him a formidable competitor of Mr. Lincoln in the Baltimore convention. We can see for him only one danger; which is, that if he submits his claims to the convention, he will be in honor bound by its action, and his friends would have to support Mr. LINCOLN should he be the nominee. It is quite possible that the CHASE men will give (or withhold from) FREMONT just support enough to make both his nomination and LINCOLN’S impossible, with a view to fall back on CHASE at last as a compromise candidate. The rock on which FREMONT will split, if at all, is the Baltimore convention. He should steer clear of it altogether; or rather, he should treat it as General TAYLOR did the Whig convention in 1848—that is, announce his intention to run, whether it nominates him or not, and leave its members to be their own judges of what is expedient under the circumstances. Even as a party man, he would be fully justified in this course. When Mr. LINCOLN attempts to forestall the convention, and convert it into a mere ratification meeting, his rival would be justified in disregarding it altogether.
CHASE started encumbered with all sorts of fetters—his official position under Mr. LINCOLN; his personal obligations to him; the full committal to his policy implied in his holding a cabinet office,. FREMONT has none of these embarrassments; and being neither timid by nature nor restrained by position, he will make a bold headway against the present occupant of the presidential mansion.

No Union with Slaveholders! 
BOSTON, FRIDAY, MARCH 25, 1864
GEORGE THOMPSON INVITED TO A RECEPTION MEETING IN WORCESTER.
The following invitation, numerously signed by prominent citizens, has been sent to Mr. Thompson:
To GEORGE THOMPSON, Esq. 
The undersigned, citizens of Worcester and vicinity, desire to express to you their high appreciation of the service you have rendered to the cause of the American Union during the last three years, and to the cause of human liberty during an earnest and useful life. We, therefore, most cordially invite you to visit Worcester at an early day, and present your views on public affairs.
ALEX. A. BULLOCK,
J. M. EARLE
T. W. HAMMOND, and others. 
MR. THOMPSON'S REPLY.
10 Chester Park, BOSTON, March 19, 1864.
GENTLEMEN—I am this day favored with a communication, signed by yourselves and others, inviting me to present to the citizens of Worcester “my views on public affairs.”
Gentlemen, I gladly and gratefully accept your invitation, and at the same time thank you for the kind and flattering terms in which it is conveyed.
If Monday, the 28th instant, should be a suitable time, I will, on the evening of that day, embrace the opportunity which your proffered welcome will afford me, to state with what profound gratification I have marked the progress of public sentiment in this country, since I was last among you; and with what pleasure and hopeful anticipation the change has been witnessed by the friends of “Union and Emancipation” in Great Britain.
Gentlemen, I have not forgotten the generous hospitality extended to me by the city of Worcester thirteen years ago; and I shall rejoice to find myself once again the guest of the citizens of the sound and noble “heart of the Commonwealth” of Massachusetts. 
I am, with great respect,
Your friend and servant,
GEO. THOMPSON.
Mr. Thompson having, in his reply, referred to his former visit to Worcester, it may not be inappropriate to remind our readers of the circumstances connected with that visit.
On the 15th of November, 1850, at a meeting held in Faneuil Hall to welcome Mr. Thompson on his arrival in Boston, no speaker was allowed a hearing, in consequence of the “continuous interruption and indecent behavior of an organized band of lawless and impudent intruders." As a deserved and salutary rebuke to the mobocratic and pro-slavery spirit of this city, and for the purpose of vindicating the right of free speech, Mr. Thompson was immediately invited to Worcester, in the terms of the following document:—
WORCESTER, Nov. 18, 1850.
To GEORGE THOMPSON, ESQ., M. P.
DEAR SIR— The undersigned, citizens of Worcester, desire to take this, method of expressing their gratitude for your eminent services in the cause of human freedom and of popular rights.
You have been long known to us as the able and zealous advocate of the principles which guided the founders of our republic.
The history of your life, for the past twenty years, has been so identified with the progress of American principles in the old world, that you have a peculiar claim to the respect and affection of America.
Your labors to establish, in England, a just system of popular representation; to abolish the odious and oppressive Corn Laws; to ameliorate the condition of the oppressed East Indians; and to abolish slavery in the British West Indies, have met with a wide and deep sympathy among our people; and, to our minds, the esteem in which all good men should hold you is not lessened by the fact, that your love of humanity has known no distinction of color or of nation.
We, therefore, hereby extend to you a cordial invitation to visit us at such time as shall be most agreeable to yourself; and assure you that you will meet in Worcester a respectful and welcome reception.”
The invitation, which was numerously and most respectably signed, was immediately accepted; and on the following Saturday morning, Mr. Thompson, accompanied by two hundred of the citizens of Boston, proceeded to Worcester. The meeting was held in the City Hall, at 10 1-2 A. M. The building was crowded by an intelligent and enthusiastic audience. As the meeting was an adjournment of that which had been riotously broken up in Faneuil Hall, the officers previously appointed took their respective positions.— EDMUND QUINCY, ESQ., as president, opened the proceedings with a speech, narrating the circumstances connected with the Boston meeting. Mr. GARRISON then submitted a series of Resolutions, suitable to the occasion, and was followed by WENDELL PHILLIPS, Esq., who delivered a powerful and eloquent address; after which, Mr. Thompson rose, and, as the reports published at the time described, was greeted with “the most enthusiastic applause, again and again renewed.” Mr. Thompson having spoken at great length, the proceedings were continued (with a brief interval for refreshment) until five in the afternoon, when a vote of thanks to the municipal authorities having been unanimously passed, the immense audience slowly dispersed with a feeling of heartfelt satisfaction, caused by the noble conduct of the generous and liberty-loving citizens of the “heart of the Commonwealth.” We doubt not that a similar reception awaits Mr. Thompson on the occasion of his second visit, on Monday evening next.
BIOGRAPHY OF GEORGE THOMPSON. We conclude, in our present number, the interesting and comprehensive biographical sketch of the public life, and philanthropic and reformatory labors of Mr. Thompson, by William Farmer, Esq., of London. It will serve to enlighten many persons, in this country as to the character and animating spirit of Mr. Thompson, and increase the personal interest of his numerous friends and admirers. Mr. Farmer will accept our warmest acknowledgments.

GEORGE THOMPSON IN SPRINGFIELD
1851 and 1864—A Contrast.
On Tuesday evening, the 15th inst., Mr. Thompson delivered an address to the citizens of Springfield, Mass., in the Music Hall of that city. He said:— 
A few reminiscences of my last visit to this locality may enable me to illustrate the contrast which I desire to present to your contemplation, between the state of popular sentiment in New England then and now.
Thirteen winters have passed away, and thirteen successive springs have returned to gladden the earth, since I last stood in the city of Springfield. What was the object that then brought me to this busy, thriving and beautiful part of the Old Bay State? I came at the invitation of a few friends of religion, justice, freedom and humanity, to address so many of the citizens as might desire to hear me, on the topics which then agitated the public mind. I came in the spirit of peace and friendship, of fraternal sympathy and brotherly love. I came to serve no personal object, to ask no favor for myself. What I had to ask was for others, and not for myself. I came to plead with such as were not dead to all sense of righteousness and pity, on behalf of the poor fugitives from bondage in the South, who were being hunted by two-footed monsters over the soil made sacred by the tread of the Pilgrim Fathers. I came to plead on behalf of those eternal principles, for the sake of which, and to establish which, your ancestors had renounced home, country and friends, and the houses of God in which they and their lathers had worshipped. I came to re-assert and to defend the immortal truths proclaimed in your Declaration of Independence—truths for which no people had contended more bravely, or bled more freely, or died more sublimely, than the people of good old Massachusetts. I came on the day following a New England Sabbath. It was Monday, the 17th of February, 1851.
The night before, I had, in a neighboring city, delivered a solemn address on the Christian duties of the American people, in view of the crisis in their history which had then arrived. I had been heard and rewarded with respectful attention.
I well remember it was a bright and exhilarating morning when I stepped into the cars at Providence to commence my journey to Springfield. On the way, I purchased a newspaper to beguile the time. On opening it, I found it contained information of special interest to myself. I read therein, that on the previous Sabbath morning—when the church bells were ringing, and the devout inhabitants of Springfield were directing their steps to the several houses of prayer;; on the Sabbath morning, when the people were about to offer worship to the God who “ hath made of one blood the families of the earth” —that God who hath said by the mouth of his lawgiver, “Whoso stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death”: and again, “Thou shall not return unto his master the servant that hath escaped from his master unto thee”—— I read that on that same Sabbath morning, when the people were about to enter the temples erected to the Redeemer of the world, they were invited to gaze upon the spectacle of an Englishman hung in effigy upon a branch of one of the trees adorning the city green; which effigy had a placard affixed to it directly inciting to outrage and murder. I was the Englishman thus executed in effigy—I was the Englishman thus pointed out as worthy of mal treatment and death.
The journal I had purchased in the railcar was the Springfield Republican. Did that paper simply narrate the facts, and leave its readers to make their own comments? No. It said to its readers—
“This evening, according to announcement, George Thompson, the English Abolitionist, will make his appearance in Hampden Hall, for the purpose, we presume, of denouncing the American Constitution, libelling the Christian Church, and abusing the greatest and best men, liviny and dead, that have ever impressed their names upon our country’s history.”
It said of the meeting to be held—
“We presume it will be made the scene of political. fanaticism, blind perversion of truth, and such handling of sacred things as shall wound the moral sense like the naked blow of blasphemy.”
"Such was the language of the leading article. But not content with these imputations—imputation absolutely false, utterly unfounded, and full of all uncharitableness and malignity—it gave gratuitous insertion to the placard which had been attached to the effigy—a placard which I have described at a direct incentive to outrage and murder. Here are some of the words of the placard:—
"Men of Hampshire! will you allow an English Serf to come amongst you, and create a civil war by continuing agitation now happily disposed of by our government? "
Again:— 
"Is it rational, is it reasonable, is it even plausible that George Thompson, a member of that very British Parliament whose laws have placed the masses of the English and Irish people in a position of such want and oppression that they would gladly exchange their lot for the comparative freedom of the American slave of the South, can be aught but a paid emissary and spy of England?"
Again:—
"But a few months since, we were sending ship loads of food to his starving countrymen, for whom he was then legislating; and will, you now allow him to repay this boon by treachery—by turning a brother's knife against a brother's bosom?"
"Americans! countrymen of the murdered Emmett of Mitchell, of O'Brien, turn out and drive this miscreant from our soil; for YOUR BROTHER'S BLOOD CRIES AGAINST HIM FOR VENGEANCE!" 
Here is the conclusion:—
"Fellow-citizens, be at your posts. The moral strength of the community is with us; let the PHYSICAL BE PRESENT.”
"Let your cry be, 'America, and a home for all! Union and vigilance against the machinations of despots!’” 
Such was the language of the Springfield Republican and such was the atrocious and bloodthirsty language which it virtually endorsed and approved, by giving it gratuitous publication. With regard to the charge brought against me in these vile and wicked productions, it is sufficient for me to say, that they are as false as they are inflammatory. From my youth up I have been the defender of the poor against the rich; of the oppressed against the oppressor; of the slave against his tyrant. As regards Ireland, I was the friend, associate and fellow-laborer of Daniel O'Connell, and in my place in Parliament voted for every measure of amelioration, and voted and spoke against every measure of injustice and coercion; and yet I am marked out for vengeance as guilty of the blood of Irishmen!
The journal I am quoting takes nothing back. On the contrary, it repeats to-day the slanders and calumnies of thirteen years ago. It regards the efforts which, in common with many better men, I have made in England during the last three years to enlighten and correct public sentiment in reference to America, as “but an act of justice and due reparation for past injuries“ done by me to this country. It still speaks of my “vehement attacks upon the religious, as upon the political institutions "of America;-of my “stigmatizing American citizens of character and position as sincerely opposed to slavery as myself”; says, that “looseness of personal invective indecorous even in a citizen, and disgusting in a stranger, formerly marked my public efforts." Even this very day, that journal speaks of my “fanatical, unintelligent and coarse assaults on the good and great institutions and men of this country"; and of my “ignorant injustice to the people, the institutions and the statesmen" of America. I trust the editor of that journal is here to-night (Applause.) If he should be, let me say in his presence and yours, that I challenge him to produce from any speeches delivered by me during my former visits, any thing to support the accusations he has brought against me. I deliberately defy him to produce a speech, a paragraph, a sentence in which I have ever assailed any one of
<c04>
the institutions of America, save that “peculiar institution” which is the cause of your present calamitous and sanguinary war, and which, at the present moment, all loyal Americans desire to extirpate from the soil it has so long withered and cursed. (Loud applause.)
It is said that I am changed, that I am now more respectful, measured and moderate in my tone than formerly. Such is not the fact. I am wholly unchanged; or, if changed at all, only in this respect, that I regard with deeper loathing and execration the infernal system of negro slavery, and more strongly than ever condemn the conduct of those who, having the power, if not to destroy, at least to check it, suffered it to grow and flourish, and expand and strengthen, until at last it burst beyond all restraints, and in its pride and power sought to make shipwreck of all most dear to you, and most sacred to humanity at large. (Applause.) No, I will not allow it to go forth that I am a changed man. Show me a man, a minister, a statesman, who in the present day defends slavery, and I will, if possible, denounce him with double emphasis. My course on slavery has been one without variableness or shadow of turning. (Applause.) If I was a blasphemer before, I am a blasphemer now. If I libelled the living and the dead then, I denounce the same men now. If I was an enemy of your institutions then, I am equally so now. Here I stand to defend and justify every charge I ever made against the churches of America, the statesmen of America, or the institutions of America; and I think that, with the aid of recent revelations and recent events, I could more triumphantly than ever make good my charges. (Applause.) Whoever may have changed, I have not changed; neither have those thrice-honored colleagues of mine who were included in the indictment brought against me thirteen years ago.
Let me now return to the railroad car in which I travelled from Providence to Springfield, in which I read the proceedings by which the Sabbath in your city had been desecrated and degraded. Nothing deterred, I came amongst you. I put up at the Hampden Hotel. I was soon joined by the John Hampden of America, Wendell Phillips. We were, informed that Hampden Hall had been closed against us. Evening came, and with it signs of a popular commotion. The effigy, the placard and the leading article had done their work. The sounds of drum and fife were heard, and soon a riotous and drunken rabble paraded before the hotel, throwing stones through the windows of the room we occupied, and defacing the walls with filthy missiles. Again the mob made the circuit of the city, and returned re-enforced. They set up a post. They hung in effigy the hated Englishman to a cross-beam. They placed a tar-barrel filled with straw beneath. They kindled a fire. They joined hands, and danced round it with the fury and savage glee of drunken cannibals; and when George Thompson, represented by the unsightly carcass they had fastened to the gibbet, fell into the flames, they raised a chorus of yells, howls, screeches and imprecations that might have startled the more decorous inhabitants of Pandemonium itself.
And where, during this horrible, disgusting and disgraceful scene, were the municipal authorities of Springfield? Where were the law-abiding, law-preserving, law-asserting citizens of Springfield? Where? They were safe and snug at home. They were collecting their families around the domestic altar. They were preparing sermons in favor of the Fugitive Slave Law. They were reading the Springfield Republican, and perhaps anticipating that the next morning’s issue would contain the pleasing intelligence that the foreigner whom they had left to the tender mercies of the mob had been tarred and feathered, and ridden upon a rail out of the city.
Why do I recal to the recollection of those now present the incidents connected with my former visit? Is it to complain of the treatment I then received? No. I can forget and forgive a thousand things like these, and should not refer to them now but for the moral that I wish to draw from them. I refer to the past that I may illustrate, in the light of by-gone events, the bondage under which the whole country then groaned to the demon of oppression that reigned and revelled at the South. At the time of which I am speaking, the galling chains of the South were worn by every man in the North. The manacles riveted upon the limbs of the man-chattel of the South, were fastened also upon the limbs of the sons of the Pilgrims in New England. A venerable man, deputied by Massachusetts her ambassador to the South, in behalf of the citizens of this State, was treated with indignity, threatened with violence, and refused even a twenty-four hours’ shelter under the shade of the Palmetto. The sons of the Bay State were dragged from the decks of Boston ships, cast into the prisons of Charleston, and sold to pay their jail-fees. Even your Court-House was surrounded with chains, and learned and venerable administrators of the law had to crawl beneath them before they could ascend their seats; and when there, they had to do the bidding of the South. One of the purest of patriots, the most accomplished of scholars, and the most gifted of orators—sent by Massachusetts to the Senate—was, even in the seat and sanctuary of law and legislation, set upon by ruffian hands, and the country deprived for years of the benefit of the wisdom and eloquence of one of the noblest defenders of her honor and the inalienable rights of humanity. Such was the condition of Massachusetts, and of the entire United States of America, a few years ago.
No wonder that while such a state of things prevailed, an Englishman, claiming the right to plead for the down-trodden and enslaved black man, and of denouncing the gigantic system of despotism by which the most exalted and “godlike” amongst free Americans had been taken captive, and made to grind in the prison-house of the South, should be treated as I have described. That treatment, harsh and inhospitable as it sometimes was, wrought no change in me. I did not love the people of America, or of Springfield, less, because, when about to step into the cars on your railway platform, some cowardly ruffians, standing near, but afraid to look me in the face, flung stale eggs at me. I did not return to England to whine over my wrongs, or to decry your institutions, or to inveigh against republicanism and democracy, or to join the enemies of progress and popular rights. No; but I went back, if possible, more than ever the devoted and unrelenting foe of that execrable system which had enslaved, not only the bodies and souls of millions of black men, but had enslaved, also, the intellect, thought, literature, commerce, religion and conscience of a race kindred to my own;— a race that had but to burst its green withs asunder, to declare itself free, and to strangle and destroy its enslaver, in order to become the noblest and the greatest on the face of the earth. (Loud applause.) The time arrived when I might prove by deeds, not only that I cherished no unkind feeling towards the people of America, but that my professions of friendship and good-will were not mere vain and empty words.
You had, for half a century, sought by every means, no matter how humiliating and debasing, to keep on terms of friendship and union with your “Southern brethren." You had consented to the extension and aggrandizement of slavery. You had consented to be ruled by the Slave Power. You had consented to, and even assisted in, the elevation of slaveholders to the Presidential chair of a democratic republic. You had consented to the appointment of slaveholders as your representatives at foreign courts. You had consented to see five slaveholding judges out of nine occupy the bench of your Supreme Court. You had consented to be deprived of the right of giving a cup of cold water to the trembling fugitive who, with parched lips, passed your door on his way to British soil, there to find a refuge from the pursuing kidnapper. You had consented to be misrepresented, ridiculed, belied, insulted and spat upon by your insolent and haughty brethren of the South. You bore all with a patient shrug—-nay, in your political parties you ran an eager race to see which could be most abject in the presence of your tyrants; which could
<c05>
bend lowest before the demon of slavery; which could make the largest sacrifices of honor, independence and conscience to the ever-craving yet never satisfied demands of the South. You "loved to be despised," and, verily, you had your reward.
Your overseers and masters at last demanded more than you could grant, without surrendering of the name as well as the substance of liberty. They required the removal of every barrier to the universal spread of slavery. They demanded the right to bring, retain, and hold their slaves within every State and Territory belonging to the Union; and they denied to you the right to elect any man to the presidential chair, who was not a known, pledged, and sworn friend and defender of the “peculiar institution." They did more. When they saw the uprising of a power in the North that would, sooner or later, successfully contend with them for the mastery, they assisted to bring about the event which they affected to deprecate, and virtually elected Mr. Lincoln that they might have the pretext which they wanted, to break up a Union which they valued only so far as it was useful to themselves. Determined to rule the country, absolutely and universally, or to demolish the fair fabric which had been raised by the wisdom, the love of liberty, the valor and the blood of the fathers of the revolution, they rent the Union in twain. They did so by a conspiracy, and by acts, as foul, as traitorous, as wicked, as any ever resorted to by the worst of men in any age. While yet the sworn supporters of the government, and official servants of the people, they were guilty of the most flagitious, malversation and treason. While yet the pliant and prostituted tool whom they had chosen filled the Chair of State, months before the man who through their divisions and diabolical stratagems had been elected had assumed office, they carried their plans into execution. Having exhausted the national treasury; having corrupted the national army; having scattered the national navy; having emptied the Northern arsenals, they seceded, and instantly laid robber hands upon whatever of national property they found within the territory they had traitorously wrested from the Union. They raised an army; they called a Convention; they proclaimed a Constitution; they elected a President and a Congress; they declared themselves "The Confederate States of America;" they sent their Commissioners to Europe; and they demanded of the civilized world, that they should be admitted into the family of nations.
The despots of the earth rejoiced. The enemies of progress, of free institutions, and of human rights, sent up a shout of triumph. The aristocrats of the old world exclaimed" See, the bubble has burst! The boasted experiment of democratic government has failed! The soaring eagle of the West droops; the United States of America are no more!" All this time, the twenty millions of the North made no sign of resistance to the daring treason of the South. It seemed as though they would passively submit to see a government established over one-half the national territory, founded upon principles the reverse of those that had constituted the basis and justification of the revolution for their own independence. The man whom the majority of the people of the North had elected, succeeded to a bankrupted exchequer, a decimated army, a navy in all parts of the world but America; and took his seat at Washington in the midst of perjured rebels, with scarcely a thousand men in arms to defend his authority. Such was the state of things when the thunder of the guns aimed at Fort Sumter was heard — when the striped and starry banner succumbed to the rattlesnake rebel flag—when the multitudinous North, moved as by an electric shock, started as one man to its feet, and New England’s Quaker poet, in rapt amazement and devout thanksgiving, could exclaim—
"Now joy and thanks for evermore!
The weary night has well nigh passed;
The slumbers of the North are o’er
The giant stands erect at last!”
(Loud applause.)
I need not tell you the history of the next three years—it is written in battle, bereavement, and blood. Well, the time came when an Englishman, who hated your country, who desired the overthrow of its institutions, and wished to see the Constitution and Union annihilated, might do something effectually to bring about those objects. I had been described by your own journal (that still refuses to retract its calumnies) as such an Englishman. The way in which I have spent the last three years of my life is a sufficient answer to such misrepresentations. I will not speak of the result of my labors, but this I may say, I have done what I could. You have had enemies in England— many, powerful, and virulent. I have met them, and have fought your battle. Ridicule and vituperation, falsehood and misrepresentation have been directed against you, and I have labored to repel these weapons, and to set the people, the institutions and the cause of this country justly before the people of my own. Nor I alone. I may truly say that the best men in Great Britain are to-day on the side of the Northern States. For your sakes, hundreds of thousands of the honest, intelligent operative classes of my country have borne, without a murmur, the pangs of hunger; and when most suffering from the effects of the present war, have been most desirous that it should continue until you had utterly crushed the rebellion in your midst, and struck every manacle from the bonds of every slave. (Applause.) You have now with yon in Great Britain, all those who have been the reformers of the great abuses imposed upon us by the aristocratic rulers of our country. You have with you those who have labored for the emancipation of our own slaves; who have won for the people an extension of popular rights; who have grappled with and overthrown the chartered monopoly of the East India Company; who have wrung from bread-taxers the repeal of the corn laws; and who are now seeking to obtain for the tiller of the soil the means of obtaining some small portion for himself. Judge what the joy of such men must be, and what must be my joy as one of them, to see the change which has been wrought in the popular sentiment of the people of these Northern States!— to find that your battle-cry now is, not only “ The Union, one and inseparable, now and for ever," but Liberty for all —for black as well as white;—Liberty universal, and Liberty everlasting! (Applause.)
Oh, how I exult in the present state of things! I left you slaves; I find you free. When I left you, the journalist, the politician, the clergyman, the publisher, the merchant, the Bible distributor, the colporteur —all were slaves. Now the pulpit, the platform, the mart, the exchange, the court of justice, the hall of legislation, the press —all are free. Now, cotton is no longer king. Now the slave power totters to its fall. Now the negro can demand the rights of humanity, is not only recognized as a man, but carries arms in the service of the State; and a black regiment saves an army from destruction. And now the abhorred Englishman, for whom tar and feathers were too good, returns and receives a warm welcome, (for which he is proudly grateful,) even from an audience in the good city of Springfield.
“Look on this picture, and on this,”
and suffer me to share the joy to be derived from the contrast between THEN and Now.
Mr. Thompson lectured in Lawrence on Wednesday evening, and in Lowell on Thursday evening of this week. On Monday evening next he will address the citizens of Worcester—and on the Wednesday evening following, those of Philadelphia —in each instance by special invitation of prominent and highly respectable gentlemen. In response to the invitation extended to him by Senators and Representatives, the Vice President of the United States, and the Loyal Association, he will speak in Washington on the 6th of April.
On his return from Washington, Mr. Thompson will proceed to western New York, as far as Rochester, to fulfil lecturing engagements in that quarter; returning in season to be at the New York anniversary, May 10th.

GEORGE THOMPSON IN NEW BEDFORD.
George Thompson, Esq., delivered the last lecture of the course before the new Bedford Lyceum, in the North Christian Church, in that city, on Tuesday evening. On his first visit to this country, he was invited to New Bedford, and was expected to speak in the same edifice. But the public were prejudiced against him, as in other parts of the country, and the determination to perpetrate mob violence was so evident and strong, that it was not thought prudent for Mr. Thompson to attempt to speak. On the present occasion, however, a very different scene was presented. A crowd thronged the door, before, they were opened, and the spacious religious building was crowded in every part by an intelligent audience, anxious to listen to the word, of words of the man who had labored so long amid contumely and violent opposition, in behalf of the rights of man, and no less for the benefits of the enslaver than of the enslaved.
The audience having been called to order by Charles Almy, Esq., Mr. Thompson was welcomed to New Bedford in a brief but interesting address by Daniel Ricketson, Esq., Who referred to his labors in behalf of humanity and the oppressed in Europe, Asia and America, and in association with the most eminent philanthropists of England and this country, and assured him of a hearty welcome by the citizens of New Bedford.
Mr. Thompson then spoke for an hour and a half in the most eloquent manner. We shall attempt no report of his address. He alluded to the great change in the state of things in regard to slavery in America since his last visit, expressed his gratification at the prospect of the speedy and final triumph of freedom here, vindicated the abolitionists from the change that their labors had done nothing towards promoting this great revolution, spoke of the state of public sentiment in England of this country, and especially of the laws effect of the law authorizing the enrolment of slaves in the Union armies, referring particularly to the heroism of Sergeant Carney, of New Bedford, at the assault of Fort Wagner, and of the 54th regiment at the battle of Olustee, as displaying the courage and capacity of the colored man, and furnishing the firmest assurance, that the black man could never again be reduced to slavery. He was listened to with the closest attention, and drew down frequent and hearty applause. He more than equalled the expectation of his hearers. His visit was in every respect a success, and cannot fail to be beneficial in strengthening the tone of public sentiment, and the resolution of the citizens of New Bedford to maintain the anti-slavery position, with which he showed himself to be familiar, and for which he so kindly expressed his admiration.

FREMONT MEETING AT COOPER INSTITUTE.
A meeting in favor of the nomination of John C. Fremont to the Presidency of the United States was held on Friday evening at room No. 25, Cooper Institute New York. Mr. B. F. Manierre called the meeting to order, and Mr. E. Gilbert presided. Messrs. R.L. Darragh and D. Plumb were named as vice-presidents, and I. W. Haff performed the duties of Secretary. The chairman addressed the meeting; opposing the policy and conduct of the administration; yet, he said, it was the duty of the club to support the measures of the government which tend to put down the rebellion. The chairman favored the one-term principle. He believed that John C. Fremont could strike the needed blow for freedom. The Amnesty Proclamation was too charitable—it made rebellion easy. The pathfinder was for a complete annihilation of the causes of the rebellion.
A platform of principles was then read. It comprised a nomination of Mr. Fremont for President; recognized in him the pioneer of the principles of the club, and a representative of a national policy which should comprehend: 
A vigorous, consistent, concentrated prosecution of the war against the insurgent armies in the field; with adequate penalties for treason, and no amnesty except to absolute submission.
The right of suffrage to be regulated by legislative bodies, and not prescribed by the Executive.
No restoration of civil rights as an inducement to rebels to forswear themselves. 
No initiation of serfdom by attaching the person of the laborer to the soil.
Absolute equality of all men before the law, without distinction of race or color.
Extension of the beneficent principles of the Homestead law; and a liberal distribution of bounty lands among all soldiers.
Paramount nationality, as opposed to a seditious application of the doctrine of supreme state rights.
The rigid maintenance of the Monroe doctrine, so as to vindicate the republican integrity of the continent.
A reformed and thoroughly American foreign policy, without regard to the opinions or menaces of foreign powers.
A liberal system of foreign emigration. 
The one-term principle for the Presidency, so as to secure the integrity of the incumbent till the last hour of his office, and prevent the distribution of his patronage for the subjugation of the constituency by office holders.
An amendment, proposed by Mr. Plumb, as follows, was subsequently made:
That the immediate and entire extinction of slavery throughout the United States is demanded by justice, and as necessary to a speedy overthrow of the rebellion and the establishment of a permanent peace.
Mr. J. F. Whipple then made a speech. Horace Greeley followed. He thought that the nomination, and the discussion of the resolutions, should be postponed. He was friendly to all the gentlemen named for the Presidency, and would support the man who received the nomination of the national convention. Mr. Greeley also said he was in favor of the one-term principle, and stated his belief that Mr. Fremont, if made President, would carry into effect the principles of those who favored putting down the rebellion and its cause, and sustaining freedom.
Messrs. Gupp, Parker Pillsbury., Sinclair Toacey and others made addresses, when the club adjourned, subject to a call for a ratification meeting.

THE PROCLAMATI0N. 
By a singular and most happy freak of the wheel of fortune, the original draft of the President's Emancipation Proclamation fell by lottery to Hon. GERRIT SMITH.
Mr. Smith sends the following letter to the Committee, in answer to their announcement to him of the fact that he had drawn the President’s Proclamation of Freedom:
PETERBORO', March 12, 1864
WILLIAM BARNES, Esq., Chairman &c.:
MY DEAR SIR:— I have your letter announcing the gratifying fact that I have drawn the precious prize. I have never been proud of owning houses and lands; but I confess that I am somewhat elated by being the owner of this glorious Proclamation of Freedom, in the very form in which it came from our President's strong and honest hand.
Various suggestions respecting my disposition of the grand paper have already been made to me. But I feel bound to adhere to my purpose was to let it go to chased the tickets. That purpose was to let it go to the individual or association who would pay the largest price for it to the Sanitary Commission. As I believe the putting down of this infernal Rebellion to be our highest and holiest work, so I recognize no other claims upon my possessions to be strong as that of the soldiers who are prosecuting this work. But the claim of the Sanitary Commission is the claim of the soldiers—since it is the faithful and tender nurse of such of them as fall in the way from wounds or sickness.
You will please retain the Proclamation in your office until the purchaser shall call for it.
Your friend, GERRIT SMITH.

1,000,000 PETITIONERS!
On the 1st of April, the second instalment of the Emancipation Petition will be sent to Washington; and so on, the 1st of every month, during the session of Congress.
Ten thousand petitions have been mailed within a few days from the office of the Women's League Room, 20 Cooper Institute, to the North, the South, the East, the west; thus giving loyal men and women everywhere another opportunity to register their names for freedom.
We ask all loyal editors to print copies of our petition, and circulate them through every school district in the country.
We ask the clergy of the land to circulate it in their congregations—to lay it on their communion tables, bidding their people remember that the only sacrifice the God of love demands is that they "do justice,and love mercy”—that they "break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free."
We ask every woman to give her name for freedom, and thus let the moral power of the nation be felt on the right side.
We ask those men who believe in republican institutions to build, now, the platform for the next Presidential campaign in immediate emancipation.
In order that ALL the signatures for immediate and universal emancipation, both by law of Congress and amendment of the Constitution, may be counted together, the woman’s League have added the Constitutional amendment to their prayer; and now ask all persons who circulate the Petition for one or both these methods, to send their lists of names direct to the office of the League, Room 20, Cooper Institute, New York, where they will be counted and registered, and forwarded to Washington, in one hundred thousand installments—as often, we hope, as once a month.
Form of Petition now sent out by the Womem's League:—
To the senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled:
The undersigned, citizens of————believing Slavery the great cause of the present rebellion, and an institution fatal to the life of Republican government, earnestly pray your honorable bodies to immediately abolish it throughout the United States; and to adopt measures for so amending the Constitution as forever to prohibit its existence in any portion of our common country.
THE PETITION from Lynn, asking the entire abolition of slavery, and an amendment to the Constitution forever prohibiting it in any part of the country, has eight hundred names (800) upon it. We are confident that in all our Northern towns, the number of names obtained to this petition is determined almost entirely by the amount of time which can be given to its circulation; and this needs a division of the labor. “Many hands make light work;” and we hope to be very soon receiving the signed petitions in great numbers. They may be sent either to this office or to he care of Miss S.B.Anthony, 20 Cooper Institute, New York. Let it not be thought that this is needless labor. Hon. Henry Wilson said last week, in his place in the U.S. Senate, that he had never known of session of Congress in which the advocacy of slavery was more obstinate and bitter than it had been in the House of Representatives this winter. Again we exhort our friends to vigilance and action.
BOOKS FOR THE CAMP FIRES. James Redpath, Boston, announces a series of ten cent Books for the Camp Fires, of a much higher class than the dime publications now in the market. They will contain from 96 to124 pages; new type, good paper—“neatly bound in greenbacks."No.1 is —"On Picket Duty and other Tales," by Miss L.M.Alcott, whose Hospital Sketches has been one of the most popular books of the season. No. 2 is “Clotelle, a tale of the South," with five fine illustrations. No.3 is —"The Vendetta,"one of Balzac's best tales, translated for the publisher. No. 4 is—Gulliver's Travels in Lilliput. No 5 is Victor Hugo's eloquent description of the Battle of Waterloo. Each number is complete in itself and unabridged. Ten cents to the publisher will secure a specimen copy, postage paid, to any home or camp address—or fifty cents for the list above announced. The five will all be published before the close of February. Address, Jas. Redpath, publisher, Boston. 
JEFF. DAVIS' REASONS FOR FASTING. In his proclamation for a Confederate Fast-day on the 8th of April proximo, occurs the following passage: 
"Recent events awaken fresh gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of nations. Our enemies have suffered repeated defeats, and a nefarious scheme to burn and plunder our capital, and to destroy our civil government, by putting to death the chosen servants of the people has been baffled and set at naught. Our armies have been strengthened: our finances promise rapid progress to a satisfactory condition; and our whole country is animated with a hopeful spirit, and a fixed determination to achieve independence. In these circumstances it becomes us, with thankful hearts, to bow ourselves before the throne of the Most High, and, while gratefully acknowledging so many mercies, confess that our sins as a people have justly exposed us to his chastisement."
LITTLE ROCK, (Ark.) March 18. 
Partial returns from eleven counties give more votes than the whole number required by the President to place Arkansas in the Union. The other counties will give full 500 more. The new State Constitution was almost unanimously ratified, there being only 137 votes against it. Arkansas is thus declared a free State in the Union, and the whole Free State ticket is elected. Guerilla bands made violent threats; nevertheless, the citizens were enthusiastic in their determination to vote the State back into the Union, many going to the polls at the risk of their lives. The military used every exertion to protect the voters. 
GIFT TO THE PRESIDENT. We learn from the Washington Republican that at the Presidential reception on Saturday, Major French presented to the President a pair of woolen socks, knit expressly for the President by Miss. Addie Brockway of Newburyport, Mass. On the bottom of each was knit the secession flag, and near the top the glorious stars and stripes of our Union, so that when worn by the President, he will always have the flag of the rebellion under his feet. These socks were sent by the maker to Mrs. Wm. B. Todd of Washington, and at her request Major French presented them with a few appropriate remarks. They were most pleasantly and graciously received by the President.
Col. McCobb officially communications the part taken by his command in the late action at Vadalia, La., which resulted in a victory to our troops. His force of 300 colored troops put to flight, in great confusion, three or four times their number of rebels, with a loss of one killed and five wounded, some mortally. A number of prisoners were taken. Not a man on our side was hurt.
FIFTY PERSONS KILLED. Intelligence from Memphis states that a block of twenty buildings used as commissary store houses had fallen in, burying beneath the ruins about forty negroes, and five or six soldiers who were guarding the buildings.
Mr. Sumner’s report on the Fugitive Slave Law fills fifteen close columns of the Globe.
AS ELOQUENT SPEECH. That of Hon. A.H. Bullock, at the reunion of the Legislature of 1862,in Boston, on the 15th inst.
Of 1718 applications,784 have been selected for commissions in negro regiments by the Casey examining board.
President Lincoln has issued a call for 300,000 more men. The 15th day of April is the time fixed for filling up of this and all past quotas, and after that time all deficiencies will be made up by draft.
The President has sent an autograph copy of his speech at the Gettysburg celebration to the Fair at New York, at the request of Mr. Bancroft, the historian, to accompany the manuscript copy of Mr. Everett’s oration on the same occasion.
The volume of Wendell Phillips’s speeches has changed publishers, and now bears the imprint of Walker, Wise & Co, Boston. The speeches, mean while, are as admirable as ever.
The Sanitary Fairs recently held at Chicago, Boston, Cincinnati, Albany, Brooklyn, Cleveland and Buffalo have realized $1,002,000.
While some colored people were having a hall at a hotel in Cheshire, Mass., last Friday night, a crowd of colorphobists from North Adams mobbed the house, destroying furniture, crockery and bedding, robling the money drawer of $50, and breaking up the party.

Let us seek to make this day acceptable to the Lord, by devoutly consecrating our purposes as a people to the fulfilment of the Great Work of National Duty, committed to our charge by the divine commandment, "to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke."
So then shall we inherit the promise—"They that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shall be called the repairer of the breech, the restorer of paths to dwell in."
Given at the Council Chamber, in Boston, this Fourth day of March, in the year of our Lord One Thousand Eight Hundred and Sixty-Four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the eighty-eighth. JOHN A. ANDREW.

LETTER FROM FORTRESS MONROE.
DEP'T OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,
FORTRESS MONROE, March 19, 1864.
To the Editor of the Boston Journal:
This is one of the most interesting departments of the war. As Washington seems to be a battle-ground for the elements between the North and the South, so this position, so near to Richmond, seems never safe from rebel raids. The strictest vigilance, the sternest discipline, and even severity, are needed to keep the hissing, rampant spirit of rebellion quiet. Every man is armed, and outside of a guard no man knows how coon he may be snapped up and carried to Richmond. The flag-of-truce boat and the exchange of prisoners keeps up a healthy excitement. We get the freshest news from Dixie's land.
The negro troops are here seen in their glory. Better clad better disciplined or more orderly troops cannot be found in the army. This is especially true of the United States Colored Cavalry, one thousand strong, under Col. Cole. Major Deniaon of Massachusetts is one of the finest officers in the service. He has done much to bring this corps to its high state of discipline.
 The contrabands, who are very numerous, are divided into three divisions. One under Capt. Wilder of Massachusetts; one under Capt. Brown also of Massachusetts, a man of extraordinary executive abilities; and one under Rev. Horace James. The whole arrangement is under the superintendence of Gen. Kinsman, of Gen. Butler’s staff. The schools of the contrabands are very successful. Among the teachers is a daughter of “old John Brown,” a lady of about twenty summers—very plainly but neatly dressed, not handsome, but with a resolute and conscientious air, s it she inherited from her sire a trust of great magnitude.
Sunday is a great day with our colored brethren. The large churches of Norfolk are filled with them. From 700 to 1000 meet for worship in one church. These people are accustomed to speak out in meeting, and express their feelings without asking permission of Mr. Jeff. Davis. They respond to loyal sentiments, and on the mention of the President’s name they shout out—“Yes, yes! God bless Mr. Lincoln!” “God bless President Lincoln!” “Amen, Amen!”—with such earnestness and unanimity that the house seems for a moment to be in great confusion. It is customary to pray, not only for the President at every service, but for the Commanding General. Gen. Butler’s name is always received with a storm of applause. He is even more popular than the President. The blacks have got an idea somehow or other that Gen. Butler is their especial friend. They trust in him and feel safe under his strong arm. And it if he is not protected by Divine Providence it will not be because he has not the prayers of the lowly and oppressed.

ENLISTMENT OF SLAVES IN KENTUCKY.
Gov. Bramlette has just issued the following address to the people of Kentucky:
EELLOW-CITIZENS: In view of the disturbance of the popular mind produced by the enrollment of slaves for the army in Kentucky, it is deemed prudent to make the following suggestions for the benefit and guidance of the loyal people of Kentucky. 
Your indignation should not move you to commit acts of violence, nor to unlawful resistance. Standing as we have good, and will ever stand, "for the Constitution, the Union, and the enforcement of the laws,” we must repel the efforts of rebellion to overthrow our Government by our gallant soldiers in the field, and meet and correct unjust or unconstitutional legislation by legal appeals to the constituted tribunals of the Government, and through the ballot-box, in the constituted manner. 
This is the only true mode of maintaining the Constitution, the Union, and the enforcement of the laws. 
The mere act of enrolling the names of slaves does not affect any right of the citizen. No draft has been ordered, nor do we know that a draft will be ordered. It may or it may not. We should abide by and maintain the law, and pursue the modes provided for the remedy it affords. 
If any violence or wrong to the person or property of the citizens be committed by any officer or soldier, against the known laws of the land, make your accusation in the mode prescribed by law; and if the commanding officer refuses or neglects to use the utmost endeavors to arrest the officers or soldiers under his command so accused, and hand him or them over to the civil magistrate for trial when officially advised of the facts, the Executive of the State will prefer charges, and demand a Court-Martial for the trial of the offenders. 
In the Union, under the Constitution, and in accordance with law, assert and urge your rights. 
It is our duty to obey the law until it is declared by judicial decision to be unconstitutional. 
The citizen whose property may be taken under it for public use will be entitled, under the imperative mandate of the Constitution, to a just compensation for his private property as taken for public use. 
Although the present Congress may not do us justice, yet it is safe to rely upon the justice of the American people, and an appeal to them will not be unheeded or unanswered.
 Peace restored and the unity of our Government preserved, the people will drive to an ignominious distance those who, in the agony of our conflict, perverted their sacred trusts to the base uses of partizan ends and fanatical purposes. 
Uphold and maintain your Government as the one constituted, and obey and enforce its just demands as the only hope of perpetuating free institutions. 
THOS. E. BRAMLETTE.
THE ENROLMENT OF SLAVES IN KENTUCKY. A Cincinnati despatch of the 16th inst., to the Chicago Times, says:
It is reported by the Maysville steamer to-day that considerable excitement exists in that town and the country adjacent about the enrolment of negroes; and a determined resistance was resolved upon. Among the most resolute resistants to the enrolment were those who had been regarded as strenuous advocates of emancipation, as well as a vigorous prosecution of the war. 
The place is in a flatter, and the general expression is, that the enrolment shall not take place, or if it does, it shall be "“by walking over the dead body of somebody,” which is a favorite Kentucky expression. On the other hand, the government has mounted the 4th Kentucky infantry, and proposes mounting others to patrol the State and aid the Federal officers in executing the law on that subject. 
The President has already sent word back to Kentucky that the enrolment of the negroes must proceed, let the consequences be what they may. The next movement of Gov. Bramlette is looked for with considerable anxiety, It is believed that he will call out the State force to resist the Federal encroachments.
Our advices are that the same bitter feeling is evinced all over the State, and unless the matter is amicably settled between the State and Federal authorities, serious results must follow.
GOV. Bramlette, of Kentucky, passed through this city last evening,. on this way to Washington, and expressed himself very decided in his determination to resist the President relative to the plan of enrolment of negroes in Kentucky.

THE PRESIDENCY.
Fourteen States have declared their preference for Mr. Lincoln for President in 1865, as follows:
Pennsylvania Legislature.
New Jersey Legislature.
California Legislature.
Ohio Legislature.
Maryland Legislature.
Michigan Legislature.
Wisconsin Legislature.
Kansas Legislature.
Rhode Island Legislature.
Minnesota State Convention.
Iowa State Convention.
Indiana State Convention.
New Hampshire State Convention.
Connecticut State Convention.
Besides the merchants of New York city and various clubs, leagues and associations throughout the country.
Ninety-two of the one hundred and seven Union members of the Ohio Legislature have endorsed the presentment of Mr. Lincoln as the Union candidate for the next Presidential term.
The Portland Press gives an indignant denial to a report that Vice President Hamlin is opposed to Mr. Lincoln’s renomination. It says Mr. Hamlin’s most intimate friends in Maine are among the most zealous and active promoters of Mr. Lincoln’s renomination.
POLITICAL. The leading German Republican paper of Illinois denounces the factious course of those who propose to go into the Baltimore Convention, and then not abide the result, unless it suits them. It calls upon the German Republicans to set this matter right, by attending the primary meetings in force.
The Fremont interest are about to start a daily paper in Washington, to advocate his claims for the Presidency.
The most curious political movement of the day is the nomination of John C. Fremont for the presidency, by the Volks’ Freund, a German Vallandigham paper published in Cincinnati.
The McClellan meeting at the Cooper Institute, Thursday evening of last week, was very large and noisily enthusiastic. Speeches were made by Hon. Amos Kendall, Hon. R. D. Jacobs, Lieut. Governor of Kentucky, Gen. Norton, of Texas, and Col Lagenschwartz, all of whom among them managed to condemn every act of the present National Administration. Gen. McClellan was resolved to have the "qualifications which eminently fit him him to be the deliverer and savior of the country," and he was fairly placed upon the Presidential track.
The General Committee of the German Democratic Union party of New York city have “condemned the character of the late Democratic State Convention at Albany, as incompatible with fealty to the Union and its constituted government.” The Committee also approve of the withdrawal of the Tammany delegation from that Convention.
SOLDIERS’ GREETING IN HANOVER. The Ladies’ Soldiers’ Relief Society of Hanover gave an entertainment on the evening of the 17th inst., both as a greeting to the soldiers of the 18th regiment and to aid the Sanitary Commission, for which a handsome sum was realized. The interest of the occasion was greatly increased by the presence of the battle-torn flag of the 13th. The meeting was addressed by Rev. J. Freeman, Rev. Samuel Cutler, Rev. James Aiken of Hanover, Rev. H. Walker of Abington, Rev. A. Damon of New Hampshire, and Samuel Tolman, Jr., of South Scituate, who proposed that the meeting resolve itself into a Convention to nominate a President for the coming term, which was agreed to, and Abraham Lincoln received the unanimous vote of the large assembly.
A SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT. At the close of the Patent Office Fair, on Friday night, President Lincoln, in answer to loud and continuous calls, made the following remarks:-
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:—I appear, to say but a word. This extraordinary war in which we are engaged falls heavily upon all classes of people, but the most heavily upon the soldier. For it hath been said, all that a man hath will he give for his life; and while all contribute of their substance, the soldier puts his life at stake, and often yields it up in his country’s cause. The highest merit, then, is due to the soldier.(Cheers.)
In this extraordinary war, extraordinary developments have manifested themselves, such as have not been seen in former wars; and among these manifestations, nothing has been more remarkable than these Fairs for the relief of suffering soldiers and their families. And the chief agents in these Fairs are the women of America. (Cheers.)
I am not accustomed to the use of language of eulogy; I have never studied the art of paying compliments to women; but I must say, that if all that has been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in praise of woman were applied to the women of America, it would not do them justice for their conduct during this war. I will close by saying, God bless the women of America! (Great applause.)
INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT. A committee on behalf of the New York Workingmen’s Democratic Republican Association, a few days since, waited on the 
President to inform him that their Association had elected him an honorary member. The object of these organizations is to advance the working men of America in morals, position and loyalty. It binds them together in support of the Union, and induces them at all sacrifices to sustain it. They requested Mr. Lincoln to give his views on the subject matter of which their address treated. The honorary membership so 
generously tendered was as gratefully accepted. They comprehended that the existing rebellion meant more and tended more than the perpetuation of African slavery—that it was, in fact, a war on the rights of working people. Partly to show that these views had not escaped his attention, and partly because he could not 
better express himself, he read a passage from his message to Congress of December, 1861, and he then concluded as follows:
 “The most notable feature of the disturbance in your city, last summer, was the hanging of some working people by some working people. It should never be so. The strong bond of human sympathy outside of the family relation should be in uniting all working people of all nations, tongues and kindreds. Nor should this lead to war on property or owners of property. Property is the fruit of labor. Property is desirable, is a positive good in the world. That some should be rich shows that other may become rich, and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise. Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another, but let him labor diligently and build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built."
 At the conclusion of his remarks, the President handed to Mr. Still, the chairman of the committee, a copy of his speech, who upon receiving it said: "On behalf of the committee, Mr. President, I thank you, and I will only add that it is the general desire of the workingmen of the United States that the next President of the United States shall be from Springfield, Illinois, and that his name be Abraham Lincoln." To which the President answered, "I am very much obliged to you gentlemen,", and the company dispersed.
The paper money system of Jeff. Davis has already collapsed. But he learned in Mississippi—and much to the disgust of John Bull—the saving virtues of repudiation. There are now, or were lately, in circulation in the rebellious States, some seven hundred millions of rebel Treasury notes, or "“bluebacks.".” The rebel Congress has neatly provided for the "funding" of this trash after this fashion: A new issue of four hundred millions of Treasury notes has been ordered, two dollars of which till April are to be equal to three dollars of the old issue, and all of the old issues outstanding after December next are to be taxed one hundred per cent. Thus at least two hundred and thirty millions of Jeff’s paper money is 
redeemed at once; and by this law he will doubtless make a hundred millions clear profit before December. Such are the fiscal beauties of the "confederacy."
A Kingston correspondent of the Raleigh Confederate, in speaking of the hanging on the 6th instant, in Kingston, of the twenty-three captured soldiers belonging to Colonel Charles Henry Foster’s command, as deserters from the rebel conscription, says: "The prisoners were accompanied to the place of execution by a large concourse of people and a strong military escort. They ascended the scaffold with a firm and elastic step, and met their fate with unflinching fortitude and determination. They asked for no quarter, and scornfully spurned all overtures of concession on condition of returning to duty in the Confederate service. After making their peace with their God, they fearlessly proclaimed their readiness to die for their country, against which they said they had been forcibly conscripted to fight. A more sublime exhibition of loyalty to the old flag was never witnessed. The multitude were moved to tears, and openly denounced this cruel massacre, which is causing desertions from the Confederate service by the wholesale, and creating and indignation which it is feared will be uncontrollable."
 During Gen. Sherman’s expedition, a wounded Federal officer crawled into the yard of a secesh planter, when the latter took an axe, and, with a flendishness scarcely credible, struck him on the head, killing him instantly. A small party of Federal soldiers coming up shortly after the negroes told them of it, when they immediately shot the planter, and placed him in the house, which they burned to the ground.
<c04>
A BAD REVELATION FOR THE COPPERHEADS Gen. Gantt greatly shocked the nerves of the Copperhead leaders of Pennsylvania in his late speech at Harrisburg. During the delivery of his speech, he told the inhabitants that when he was brought North as a prisoner of war,. prominent “Democrats” of Pennsylvania assured him that if the rebels held out, they would be successful, for the “Democrats” would arrest, the war by defeating the conscription, &c. General Gantt added, with great emphasis, “I can give you the names, if what I say is disputed."
 This General Gantt having abandoned the rebel army, is now making abolition speeches in the North. We are not at all surprised. A miscreant who exulted in a horrid murder while on the rebel side, is naturally enough an abolitionist while on the Federal side.—Louisville Journal.
The above fling at General Gantt has been copied and approved by the Copperhead press generally. When he was in the rebel ranks fighting against his country, not one of these patriots had a word of condemnation to utter against him. But the moment he renounces rebellion, and asks to come back into the Union, then the Copperheads denounce him.
MR. CHASE AND THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION.
 The Independent, speaking of Secretary Chase's letter declining to be a Presidential candidate, says:
“Whether his example be followed or not, his act remains an honor to his heart, and his brief but elegant letter is worthy the pen that supplied to Abraham Lincoln the last and golden sentence of the proclamation of emancipation."
 “The sentence referred to, we presume, is the following:
“And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God."
 PERSONAL OPINIONS FEEBLY EXPRESSED. The New York Evening Post has been shown a bundle of thirty-eight five dollar notes on the Pottstown, Bradford county, Pa., bank, which have James Buchanan's portrait engraved upon one corner, and in thirty of the notes the word “Traitor” is written across Buchanan's forehead; in others, the letter “T” is branded; on one, the following words appear: “Give him his deserts;” on another is written, “Ye ould divil,” and still another bears this inscription: “False to his country and his God, but true to the Democratic party.” Some ingenious individuals, at a loss to express their contempt in words, resort to symbols; one has drawn a copperhead snake, wriggling in the mouth of Buchanan, another decorates the head with a cup and bells, and a third encloses the neck within a noose which is attached to a gibbet.
The Tribune very justly remarka that no man can now say that we have made no progress. Of the region claimed as belonging to the Southern Confederacy, we firmly hold West Virginia, Kentucky, nearly all Tennessee, Missouri, most of Arkansas, more than half of Louisiana, a good part of Mississippi, with portions of old Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, most of the Indian Territory, New Mexico, and Arizona. Nearly half the white population claimed as belonging to the Confederacy are this day under the Federal flag, and no longer subject to Conscription to fill the rebel armies. Our gains with in the past year more than half overthrow the Confederacy as it stood when the final Proclamation of 
Freedom was issued.
SUFFERINGS OF CONTRABANDS. A Vicksburg (Miss.) correspondent of the Tribune, under date of March 4, writes:
Some 2000 slaves of all ages and colors reached here yesterday. It was one of the saddest spectacles witnessed for a long time in Vicksburg. Women and
children were almost starved and half naked. Such a terrible picture of abject want and squalid misery can neither be imagined nor portrayed with pen. Many of the women and children were sick with fevers, , brought on by the great fatigue and exposure of the long march from Meridian, Enterprise, Quitman and 
other places.
BUTCHERY OF COLORED SOLDIERS AND THEIR WHITE OFFICERS. On the 14th of February, several companies of the 1st Mississippi (colored) regiment were sent out near Grand Lake on a foraging expedition. While gathering corn from a large deserted plantation, one company stationed as pickets a mile and a half from their companions, while sitting down at dinner, were suddenly set upon by 400 mounted guerillas (supposed to be led by Quantrell) in U. S. uniform, captured before they could use their arms for resistance, and all murdered except two, who escaped by feigning to be dead. The Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment was among the victims.
The Boston Courier is terribly provoked with Jim Brooks for admitting that slavery in this country is dead. Brooks says he is sorry, but can't resist the evidence of his own senses, though the Courier can. Like the Bourbons, it never learns and never forgets anything; consequently, it cannot see what is before its eyes—that slavery has committed suicide; it will
will never forget to extend or defend the institution, or cease embracing its carcass, though it be dead as Julius Caesar, and an offence in the nostrils of all decent men.—Yarmouth Register.
Senator Pomeroy repels the charges made in the Washington despatehes, that he had failed to 
account for the colonization funds placed in his hands.
The whole amount was $25,000, not $250,000 as reported. $14,000 of this, Mr. Pomeroy says, was paid over by him on Mr. Lincoln's order in favor of the Chiriquy land contract. Over $8000 were paid into the United States Treasury. Less than $3000 were left in his hand to be expended in outfits for the colonists, and their incidental expenses. To these two last purposes the balance was devoted.
 A correspondent calls attention to the fact that a great many boarding-houses in this city are kept by rank secessionists. This is true. There are hundreds of such houses, most of them kept by women whose husbands and relatives are in the Southern service, the women being sent North to live upon Yankee patronage and act the part of Rahab. They are the bitterest of our enemies, presuming upon their sex for security, and using that security to malign and betray the Government. Surely there ought to be some means of abating this grave and dangerous evil.—New York Tribune.
ALBANY, (N. Y.) March 14. Mr. Bryant, (Democrat,) of New York, to-day introduced into the Assembly a series of resolutions, declaring that the war must be prosecuted until slavery is annihilated; that the constitutional abrogation of slavery would clear the path to our manifest destiny, and produce the restoration of a united nation, and requesting Congress to submit to the people the Constitutional amendment forever prohibiting and exterminating slavery. 
washington, March 20.The Judiciary Committee of the House has instructed its chairman to report with a recommendation that it pass Representative Wilson's joint resolution, proposing to the several State Legislatures an amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery as incompatible with a Republican Government. 
The colored colonists who left last April under charge of Messrs. Forbes and Tuckerman, of N. Y., for the Island of Avache, have been brought back by orders of the Government, on account of their suffering from small pox and the necessaries of life. They arrived in the Potomac, a few miles below Washington, on Saturday last, in the ship Marcia C. Day. There is only 368 left out of 420.
The rebel strength in the recent attack on Yazoo City was 5000 men, with 4 pieces of artillery. The 8th Louisiana colored lost 80 killed, wounded and missing. Nine officers of this regiment out of 18 were found dead. The 1st Mississippi and the 11th regiment lost 30.
The East Tennessee elections show a large majority in favor of division from the rest of the State.
Since Andrew Johnson has taken his decided antislavery stand, the Louisville Journal condemns itself by saying that he has been a “curse to Tennessee, and a curse to the cause of the Union.”
“Parton's Life of Gen. Butler is elaborately reviewed in the London Spectator. The writer acknowledges that the book has entirely changed his opinion of Gen. Butler, and compares him, in versatility and energy, to Frederick the Great.
The Chattanooga Gazette states, that between the point of Lookout Mountain and Bridgeport, down the Valley of the Tennessee, lie twenty-five miles of dead mules, in one continuous string—the head of the first carcass lying on the“quarter deck” of the one beyond him, and so on throughout the entire distance.
 Five Parsee firms in London have contributed five hundred pounds sterling for the relief of the emancipated negroes in the United States. The Parsees are the descendants in the East Indies of the fire worshippers driven out from Persia on account of their religion. They still preserve their ancient religion, along with increased purity of morals.
 NEW YORK, March 21. The Times’ despatch says prisoners from Richmond assert as their belief that the rebels have already secretly executed a number of officers attached to colored regiments. Several have disappeared mysteriously from the Libby prison.
<c05>
ABOLITION IN BRAZIL. A Senator, Silvierba da Motta, has proposed in the Brazilian Senate that “no foreigner residing in Brazil should be allowed to hold slaves, and that those actually holding them should be obliged to sell them within a certain time”. Also that the convents and other monastic institutions should be obliged to sell their landed properties and slaves. It is becoming every day more evident that slavery is doomed in Brazil, and that ere long some measure will be taken, having for its ultimate object the entire suppression of the system.
Free schools are about being organized in Newbern, Washington, Beaufort and other places, for the education of poor white children.
 Gen. Bragg, it is stated, has recommended the rebel Secretary of War to immediately organize 200,000 colored soldiers. 
A Florida correspondent of a Charleston paper says that in the recent battle, “the Yankee darkies fought like devils.”
 Mrs. White, a sister of the wife of President Lincoln, recently reached Atlanta, Georgia, from Washington, and the rebel papers report that she smuggled through the lines a rebel uniform, the buttons of which were of gold, and worth $4000.
 Leading Republicans in Washington urge the President not to give way to the protests of Gov. Bramlette and the Kentucky slaveholders. It is not probable that he will.
 The rich, liberal, and eccentric Zadock Pratt, of Prattaville, N. Y., perpetuates the memory of his brave son, Colonel George Pratt, by having his bust carved out of a huge rock near the public highway.
 Rev. Dr. Bellows has accepted an urgent and most affectionate invitation to go to California, and fill the place made vacant by the death of Rev. Thomas Starr King.
 Fowler, the phrenologist, examined McClellan's head when he was a boy, and says he never found such an inordinate development of caution in any head before. The propelling faculties of combativeness and destructiveness were found to be small. He said to himself then, “Why send such a natural coward to West Point?"
 Several prominent storehouses, a large railroad depot, and large quantities of Government property have been destroyed by fire at Vicksburg.
 Major John C. Chadwick of Salem, late of the 9th U. S. colored regiment, now at Port Hudson, has been promoted to be Lieut. Colonel of the 22d regiment Corps d'Afrique.
 The rebel War Department advertises for four hundred slaves or free negroes to work for the nitre and mining bureau, and reminds interested parties that it has power to impress laborers, if not otherwise forthcoming.
DIED—In this city, Feb. 22, of congestion of the lungs, ALEXANDER BEARSE, aged 49 years, formerly of Barnstable. 
[Cape Cod papers, please notice.] 
March 12, Mr. JOHN LOCKLEY, aged 49. A large concourse of sympathising friends were present at the funeral. Christian consolation was administered to the afflicted widow and daughters by Rev. Messrs. R. C. Waterston, L. A. Grimes, and H. H. White.
At Jamaica Plains, Feb. 24, Mrs. EUNICE AMES, aged 97 years and 9 months. She was a pensioned widow. Her husband, Prince Ames, fought on Bunker Hill, and in several other battles of the Revolution, during his seven years' enlistment. Her son, Alexander Ames, was in the war of 1812,. and a grand-son and two great grand-sons are in the present war. The two latter were captured by the rebels at Galveston. 
She ever had an intelligent appreciation of the position for colored Americans to maintain in the struggle for their equality and the, rights of man, and always encouraged their patriotism. 
Through her long and exemplary life—that of a practical Christian—she endeared herself to a large circle of friends. They lament her departure, but their grief is chastened with an assurance that the transition is her unspeakable gain. W. C. N.
In Brighton, March 5, Mr. JOHS TELEMACHUS HILTON, aged 62. 
Born in Pennsylvania, he, when a young man, came to the Eastern States, and became a protege of the Reverend brothers Nathaniel, Benjamin and Thomas Paul—the last named so long and so favorably known in Boston. Mr. Hilton soon after married a daughter of Mrs. Eunice Ames, whose death, above recorded, preceded his own but a few days. His mental and moral excellencies won for 
him a prominence among those identified with him by complexion and condition; and in the Conventions of colored people, held in those early days throughout the States, his presence and influence were signally potent. 

He was one of the first colored Americans to greet the Anti-Slavery movement, which received, to his last day, the most devoted, unwavering affection and support. No names seemed more talismanic to him than those of WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, WENDELL PHILLIPS, MARIA WESTON CHAPMAN, and GEORGE THOMPSON. 
For a long series of years, he was an active and valued member of the Board of Managers of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, and noted for his clear vision and adherence to its cardinal principles. 
In regard to the great struggle between Liberty and Slavery, he was always hopeful—of which he gave frequent illustrations by voice and pen, as by his contribution to the LIBERTY BELL for 1844, and his Letter to the Ladies’ Anti-Slavery Subscription Festival for 1864—his last public testimony. 
 In his addresses and speeches, whether in promotion of Equal School Rights or other branches of the Anti-Slavery reform, he was unsparing of those who deserved rebuke, buft
eminently discreet and just towards all individuals and parties. 
He was remarkable, both in public demonstrations and in social intercourse, for introducing Scriptural quotations and axioms. The Bible was his text book, and he was exceedingly happy and effective in its use. 
Attached to his fellow-men by the triple cord of Masonry, Church fellowship and Anti-Slavery association, he was conspicuous in each; and justly regarded by his contemporaries as consistent and loyal to their respective offices and obligations. 
He was genial and communicative, and a favorite both of old and young; and to all a counsellor and friend. 
The funeral exercises were of a blended character; and the many manifestations of respect, exhibited by the inhabitants of Brighton were creditable to them, as they must have proved grateful to the family. Services were conducted at the house by the Orthodox clergyman, Mr. Cushman, and at the Baptist Church by Rev. R. H. Bowles, Rev. John T. Raymond, and Rev. H. H. White, the former and the present pastors of the First Independent Baptist Church, Joy Street, Boston, of which the deceased was for many years one of the pillars. 
At the grave, the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Masons, present in large numbers and in full regalia, performed their mystic ceremonies in honor of one who had been most distinguished in their order. 
To his bereaved widow and interesting group of sons and daughters, the recollection of the faithful husband and father must prove a rich legacy. They, together with his numerous relatives and friends, may derive perennial consolation from these appropriate lines:—
 “ Sure the last end
Of the good man is peace. How calm his exit!
Night dews fall not more gently to the ground,
Nor weary, worn-out winds expire so soft.
Behold him in the eventide of life!
A life well spent! whose early cars it was
His riper years should not upbraid his green;
By unperceived degree he wears away;
Yet, like the sun, seems largest at his setting.”

“He dwelleth in heaven; earth’s conflicts are o'er; 
He has sought, he has found that radiant shore 
To which his eye turned while he dwelt with us here, 
And which to the pure and the loving is near.
He dwelleth in heaven; he is free from earth-stains; 
Never more shall he suffer its sorrows and pains; 
Never more shall he bend neath the chastener's rod, 
For, ransomed and joyful, he dwells with his God."

MASON & HAMLIN'S
 CABINET ORGANS.
<IMAGE>
Every Church, Sunday School and Private Family
 MAY HAVE
A GOOD ORGAN
AT a very moderate cost—$85, $100, $110, $135, $165, $260, and upward, according to number of Stops and style of case.
 They are elegant as picces of furniture, occupying little space, are not liable to get out of order, and every one is warranted for five years.
 THE CABINET ORGANS,
introduced about a year since, and manufactured exclusivesively by MASON & HAMLIN, have met with success unprecedented in the histoty of musical instruments. Supplying a long-felt want, they have been received with the greatest pleasure by the musical profession and the public, and have already been very widely introduced, and the demand for them is still rapidly increasing, and must continue to increase as their merits become known. They are to private houses, Sunday Schools, and smaller churches, all that the larger pipe organs are to large churches. In addition to this, they are admirably adapted to the performance of secular as well as sacred music.
 The Cabinet Organ is essentially different from and a very great improvement upon all instruments of the Melodeon or Harmonium kind. Its superior excellence consists in many important characteristics, among which are:
 1.The more organ-like character, of its tones. Indeed, it is asserted with confidence that it is asserted with confidence that it has not yet been found possible to produce a better quality of tone from pipes than is attained in these organs.
 2.It has greatly more power and volume of tone is proportion to its cost.
 3.By the employment of a very simple and beautiful invention, its capacity for expression is made vastly greater than has ever before been attained in such instruments. This invention is especially valuable, because scarcely any practice is necessary to render it available. Any ordinary performer can master it in an hour or two.
 4. It admits of great rapidity of execution, adapting it to the performance of a great variety of lively secular music.
 5. No instrument is less liable to get out of order.
 6. It will remain in tune ten times as long as a piano forte.
 It may be reasonably said, that if these instruments have the great and obvious superiority this claimed for them, they must have received very warm recommendations from professional musicians, who would naturally be most in interested in the introduction of such instruments, and who are the best judges of their excellence. Such recommendations already have been given tot hem, to an extent unparalleled.
 Among those who have proffered written testimony to their admirable qualities and great desirability, and that they regard them as unequalled by any other instrument of their class, are such well-known musicians as Lowell Mason, Thomas Hastings, William B. Bradbury, George F. Root, &c; the most distinguished organists in the country, as Cutler of Trinity Church, N. Y., Morgan of Grace Church, Zundel of Mr. Beecher's Church, Braun, Wels, Wilcox, Tuckerman, Zerrahn, &c: such celebrated pianists as Gottschalk, Wm. Mason, Mill, Sanderson, Strakoach, etc.: in brief, more than two hundred musicians, including a large portion of the most eminent in the country, have testified to this effect. Each Cabinet Organ is securely boxed, so that it can be sent safely to any part of the country.

POETRY.
For the Liberator.
SONNETS.
1. "GOD'S MILL.”
How long, O Lord! shall Slavery prevail?
How long shall thy dark children wear the chain
Of their oppressors? Shall their friends still fail?
How long, O Lord! shall vice its away maintain,
And the despairing, helpless slaves complain,
While their best friends stand sad and powerless by?" 
Such was, few short years since, the pleading cry
Of many, faithless to the Mighty power 
Of Truth and Justice. Once its work begun,
"The mill of God grinds slowly," hour by hour;
"But it grinds surely, wonderfully small."
Even now it pauses not; its work undone 
Till God's dark children equal owners stand 
With their white brethren on their native land.
II. FREEDOM’S TEMPLE. 
America! On you steep mountain’s brow,
Above the clouds thou seest a temple stand, 
Sacred to truest freedom; and a vow
Hast made to spread her worship o'er the land. 
Oh, many votaries thy sons among
Has the bright goddess, who would spread her sway
O'er the wide word, where'er the light of day 
Shows how the weak and helpless suffer wrong. 
America! preserve this temple pure
From all injustice; from sad woman's tear, 
From Slavery’s moan; lest the oppressor sneer,
And cry, "Is Freedom'S temple insecure 
To her dark votaries? and weak woman, there, 
Has she no place, no equal rights to share? "
III. THE FUTURE.
Oh, it is good to think in years to come,
When War and Hate have run their dreadful race, 
And like a winter-flood have swept the face
Of the whole land from Slavery—that seum 
Of most unhealthy life—that heavy scum
Of every villany, man's worst disgrace 
Oh, it is good to think, beneath the reign
 Of just, impartial laws, in brotherhood, 
Seeking in peace and harmony to gain
 For each and all, or black or white, the good,— 
Long lines, descended from the men who fell
 In deadly strife for freedom, or for power, ln 
In true and free equality shall dwell;
 Of white or black the best, the richest dower.
JANE ASHBY.

"WHEN THE PRINCE IS PASSING BY."
INSCRIBED TO ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
In Corea. when the Prince passes by with step of state, 
All the people shut their doors, and their windows
closely bar; 
And woe betide the laggard who is caught without the
gate, 
When the Prince is passing by, under sun or under star!
Partly fear and partly hate prompt them thus to hide 
away
When the Prince is passing by, so that silence reigns supreme,
As in cities in the sea, visible at close of day, 
Or in th' enchanted hall, in the poet's princely dream.
But it matters little now, save to illustrate the lay, 
And contrast it with the hour when another Prince
goes by! 
When Emancipation rides through his broad domains to-
day,
And we do not close the doors or the windows from his 
eye.
But we open wide each gate, and from every outpost fling 
To the breeze his stainless flag, fearing not to stand and
see
How the shadows backward leap, and the sunbeams for-
ward spring, 
And the Nation's pulse is quickened by the President's
decree. 
And the Prince is passing by! Waited for—expected
long
Prayed for by the slave in chains—on the block and at
the stake—-
Patient-hearted under wrong—suffering, yet growing
strong—
Looking forward to the day when he should their 
shackles break.
How they throng the path he takes! how they follow in
his tread! 
How the very infants spring in their mothers' arms to
day!
What blessings are invoked, as he bows his stately head, 
And smiles upon the Freedmen as he passes on his way.
Are there any bolted doors? Are there any windows
Draped? 
Be sure no child of freedom calls that his home and
hearth;
The viper's head is hidden, for the victim has escaped 
From the land of sin and shame that has darkened all 
the earth!
And the Prince is passing by! Send your shouts of wel-
come forth!
Never heed the Corean law, in this later, brighter day:
Now the freedmen of the South are as freemen in the
North, 
And Slavery's doom is sealed, and the Curse has passed
away!
Harlem, (N.Y.) Feb. 3, 1864.

HYMN,
Written for the opening of a new House of Worship, 
(T. S. King's,) in San Francisco.
BY JOHN G. WHITTIER.
Amidst these glorious works of Thine, 
The solemn minarets of the pine,
And awful Shasta's icy shrine,—
Where swell Thy hymns of wave and gale, . 
And organ thunders never fail 
Behind the cataract's misty veil,—
Our puny walls to Thee we raise,
Our poor reed-music sounds Thy praise,—
Forgive, 0 Lord! our childish ways!
For, kneeling on these altar-stairs. 
We urge Thee not with selfish prayers, 
Nor murmur at our daily cares.
Before Thee in an evil day
Our country’s bleeding heart we lay:
We dare not ask Thy hand to stay;
But, through the war-cloud pray to Thee For 
For Union, but a Union free, 
And peace that comes of purity.
That Thou wilt bare Thine arm to save, 
And, smiling through this Red-Sea wave, . 
Make broad a pathway for the slave!
For us, confessing all our needs, 
We trust no rites nor words nor deeds, 
Nor yet the broken staff of creeds;
Assured alone that Thou art good 
To each as to the multitude, Bternal Love
and Fatherhood!
Weak, sinful, blind,. to Thee we kneel, 
Stretch dumbly forth our hands, and feel 
Our weakness is our strong appeal.
So, by these western gates of even, 
We wait to see, with thy forgiven, 
The opening Golden Gate of Heaven!
Suffice it now. In time to be, 
Shall holier altars rise to Thee,-
Thy Church our wide humanity! 
White flowers of Love its walls shall climb, 
Soft bells of Peace shall ring its chime, 
Its days shall all be holy time!
A sweeter song shall then be heard. 
The music of the world’s accord, confessing Christ
Confessing Christs, the Inward Word. 
That song shall swell from shore to shore, 
One hope, one faith, one love restore 
The seemless robe that Jesus wore!
<C02>
EMIGRATION TO HONDURAS.
To the Editor of the Liberator:
Mr. Charles Babcock, an industrious young man of . Salem, Mass., has just published a small pamphlet upon this subject, for gratuitous distribution. Mr. Babcock is himself a descendant of the Narraganset Indians, but he Identifies himself with the colored people and their interests. He has lately returned from Honduras, which he went to Visit on purpose to see what were the inducements to emigrate there. Mr. Babcock feels, as all intelligent and well-educated colored people feel, that even if slavery should be overthrown by this war of purification, the prejudice against color is too deeply rooted in society here to make it probable that, during the present generation."complexion will make no difference “in a man’s standing, which he declares to be the case in Honduras. His pamphlet, which is a hasty description of his visit and observations of Belize and its neighborhood, shows that industrious and intelligent labor cannot fail of being successful. If he and his friends, among whom are the best colored people of the North, should make up a party, and emigrate to Honduras or any part of that neighborhood, where land is rich and can be bought for five dollars an acre, and carry, as they would do, good Northern manners, customs, habits and principles, they would stand a fair chance of being leading people in a settlement where color is not regarded. It is perfectly rational that he should wish to be under British rule, rather than under the American government, for the advantages of a Republic are very much lost to the colored people here. There can be no doubt that good religious citizens of the North would be an invaluable addition to the motley society of Honduras. That country is rich in agricultural resources, and only needs cultivation. Mr. Babcock is himself acquainted with farming, as we know from his friends, and is therefore competent to speak on that subject. 
The emigration to Honduras has advantages over that to Hayti, firstly, that the English language is spoken there, and English customs are found there, and persons of different religious denominations can be suited there; whereas in Hayti, English is scarcely spoken at all, and the Catholic religion and African superstitions-pervade the whole of society. We give a few extracts from the pamphlet of Mr. B.:—
"Belize is the principal place in the colony, the headquarters of all business. The Legislative Assembly, Supreme Court and Executive Council are all held here. Among the public buildings and institutions are the Custom-House, Court-House, Hospital, Poor-House, Jail, and several churches, and barracks where Her Majesty’s troops are quartered, to the number of about three hundred, who, being all black, dressed in the Zouave uniform, when marching through the streets with martial music, on Sunday; morning, make quite an imposing appearance.
 The Belize river passes down through the town, serving as a common sewer, and is filled with number less fish, which greedily devour all offal thrown into it, and therefore keeps the town very healthy. Every market morning, a scene is presented at this place which is quite amusing; I mean the Urge number of boats and canoes which come freighted with all sorts of fruits and provisions, from a pigeon to a three hundred live hog, which are purchased by retailers; and when you consider the confusion of languages spoken here, the scene of purchase can be better imagined than described. In the stores of this little emporium of fashions, in addition to the productions of the country, and imported articles from Europe, are all the Yankee notions, from a Connecticut axe to a New England sewing machine, and they can be had nearly as cheap.”
"The people may be divided into five classes, or the descendants of so many races. 1st. The whites, mostly Scotch, a few clear Spaniards, English, Jews, Germans, French, Irish, Danes, Mexicans, and a few Americans. The government office holders are mostly from Jamaica.”
"Among the great mixture of different races here, not the slightest hostile prejudice seems to exist between any of them, so far as color is concerned.
The 2d are the Creoles, the most numerous in the colony. They are of all shades of complexion, from the unmixed descendant of the former African slave to that of a snow-white—the sons and daughters of slaveholders; and there are white persons mixed with black until you come to the unmixed Creole, born in the colony of whites.
The 3d class are Mexicans, including Indians that came from the neighboring province of Yucatan. They are numerous; some say full one half of the whole population are of this race. They are fugitives, and sought refuge in this colony during the disturbed state of that country, growing out of the war with the United States. They are mostly farmers, some making sugar, while all plant from one half to four acres of corn.”
Many more interesting particulars are given of these people.
"The 4th class, a very singular nation of blacks or brownish looking people, called Caribs, who seem to be a distinct race. Their number is about 3000. Nearly every one has his canoe, and they catch turtle and fish. They live in comfortable houses, shaded with cocoanut trees, and live at their ease. Strange to say, the women speak a different language from the men when conversing among themselves. It is said that they are a mixture of the aborigines of the country with the former African slaves; it is said by others that nothing is known of their origin.
5th. Most of the soldiers are of the African race, descendants of the old slaves.”
Mr. Babcock considers the system of labor, which he calls “ the everlasting deputy system,” very unfavorable to the laboring population. There are too many intermediate men between the capitalist and the laborer, and be remarks, very intelligently:—
"No race or set of men, take them from where you please, can remain faithful workmen for more than one generation, where the labor system deprives them of their natural rights as freemen, and where the intelligent, steady, industrious and economical realize a profit upon their stock-in-trade of less than fifty dollars a year. ... If you want more evidence of the evil effects of this barbarous labor system, go to Jamaica,* and look at the mass of the people and the worn-out plantations, where you will see strong men and women working ten hours per day in the open field, with a hoe weighing not less than seven pounds, and they board themselves, and receive from 31 to 18 cents per day. God forbid I should do any injustice to the colony of British Honduras! I therefore name the present price of common labor there, which ranges from six to ten dollars per month, payable half in cash, half in goods, with rations of four pounds of pork, and seven pounds of flour, the wages ranging according to rates of bands, one quarter, one half, three-quarters and full hands. They labor continually, rain or shine, but for only nine hours per day, allowing the afternoon for rest, and the cultivation of one’s own garden spot, if desired.”
"Like other countries where emigrants are wanted, two classes are asked for—pauper laborers and independent settlers.”
Mr. Babcock represents the climate as fine, the rainy season lasting, though not unremittingly, from Tune to December, and-the dry season one of even and continued delightful weather.’
Each denomination has its schools, and each can draw so much upon the government for their support. The Baptist denomination alone supports its own schools, and be says of the Rev. Dr. Henderson, the pastor, "a more clear-headed, bold, uncompromising reformer no one need to meet Long may be live to accomplish the herculean task before him!”
In answer to some questions asked in a private letter, Mr. Babcock says——"Emigrants to Honduras should by all means take their wives and families, for their hardships will in no manner outweigh the moral dangers their husbands would incur in a society so loosely formed as the one there.” In answer to the question, "What place would be the most eligible for a small party? “ he says——"It is one of the most beautiful islands In the world that is set apart for the landing of emigrants, called Jernaff Island, being about thirty miles north of Belize, in the bay of Honduras. This and leaser islands near it are covered with millions of cocoanut trees, which are cut down and gathered for shipment; the most delicious fish abound in the waters, and birds and pigeons are in abundance. It is very salubrious, and one great advantage of landing there is, that of avoiding contact with the natives. I presume that, by this time, more
 The laborers, here in Jamaica, are much degraded—I sean the great mass of the common people—and must necessarily remain so; for all they earn, as field hands, is, men 25 to 31 cents per day; women, 12 to 18 cents; but work only 5 days per week
<C03>
than fifty acres are all ready for the erection of temporary houses for emigrants." 
Mr. Babcock goes on to say—
" In the event of small parties, say five or six families going, it would be best to have a light framed house prepared here, for the comfort of women and children. Men, with a mosquito net, can live and sleep almost entirely out of doors, day and night, in the dry season. On arrival, the house being all ready to be set up, all danger from exposure would be saved arising from delay in transportation of lumber. Log-louses are not used, it being entirely unnecessary to provide against anything but rain. Till within six months, bricks and lumber were imported, there being no saw-mills; but in September, no lees than three were nearly ready to commence operations. Much land is owned by colored men, who are ready to sell, and the Crown has also plenty of it, but the position of the latter is leas favorable, it being more mountainous.
An industrious man, with a wife and two or three children, who has two hundred dollars to start with, is almost sure of success, by making agriculture in some sort the basis of all operations. If a man has a little surplus capital, and can take with him a few skilful laborers, his future is certain; and by a recent enactment of the Assembly, if a contract with him is witnessed by a British Consul, he will be protected by law. On no account should I recommend him to depend upon the laborers there, on account of their demoralization.
Thin flannel is the best clothing for night and day during the first year. It can be bought in Honduras, at present, cheaper than here. Cooking-stoves and other utensils, and small household articles, beds, mattresses-, and all light goods, should be carried. After houses are built, it will be easy to charter a vessel and import furniture, cotton-gins, and improved instruments of agriculture. Emigrants would probably be more favored about duties than traders are. Very little manufacturing is done there at present, but plenty of mahogany washtubs can be had.
The change in the policy of the Government, which is now doing what should have been done two years ago, enlisting and taking into the army all colored men that are able to fight, will undoubtedly check emigration for the present. The people are disposed to remain at home, and see what the future may bring forth."

THEODORE PARKER.
LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF THEODORE PARKER, 	Minister of the Twenty-eighth Congregational Society, 	Boston. By John Weiss. 2 vols. 8vo. New 	York: D. Appleton & Co.
As time draws on, and the characteristics of a State and people become daily more and more assured to America and its inhabitants, the material wealth that accompanies these developments of empire is far from being the sole endowments they bring with them. We are daily becoming mentally richer, also, the stock of native ideas fructifies, and, above all, is constantly increasing that inalienable heritage of coming generations, the memories of our good and great men—the home-crop of heroes springing from the soil, true to its instincts and sympathies, sharers of our conflicts and leaders of our victories. As "star after star decays" on earth, and the National Pantheon enlarges its boundaries to admit those who become immortal, the voice of the true sage proves, perhaps, even more potent than when it was heard in life, for counsel, rebuke, or warning, in seasons of difficulty and danger. The smoke and stir of turmoil no longer obscure their true proportions; the asperities of life are softened, and a wider audience is prepared to listen to utterances that formerly provoked to anger, or were received with indifference. Conspicuous among these " standard-bearers of humanity " recently departed, is the remarkable man commemorated in these goodly volumes. THEODORE PARKER—a name long associated with obloquy by his enemies, and hesitatingly championed even by his friends, who could not keep up with the speed of his intellectual processes—is here portrayed at full length. He stands before us in all his strength and weakness, and our literature is enriched by the life-like resemblance of one whom all acknowledged as a true man, and posterity will probably account a great one.
To his own pen is due the ample store of materials for the illustration of a character so worthy of study that the work affords. It has no claim to be considered a finished biography. The editor deserves the praise of industry, shown in the collection of these materials, and discerns their value sufficiently to place them before his readers. There is little other commendation to be given to the editorial part of the book. It is mainly written in a style so peculiar, so perversely bad, that the bold, clear, ringing sentences of Theodore Parker shine out like crystals embedded in a conglomerate of halting metaphors, tortuous rhetoric, and misapplied language in general. It might seem invidious to give specimens of the quips, cranks, and verbal enigmas that are scattered through the pages of the book, particularly as there is no profundity in the thoughts that flounder for utterance to justify the novelty of style, and it is apparently only a vicious trick of manner that leads to an uncouth license of diction, which sets sometimes grammar, and always good taste, at defiance. A charge has been made and substantiated against the American edition of the Life that involves more seriously the manner of its authorship. It is proved that suppressions have been made of passages printed at large in the English copy, but supposed to be too unpalatable for circulation here. The original mistake was no doubt committed, by publishing at all, matter more likely to hurt or injure individuals than to benefit the cause that Theodore Parker had at heart. When once this has been done, all attempt at suppression is futile, because impossible, and merely defeats its object by stimulating curiosity in these particulars. It is also peculiarly inappropriate when applied to the writings of one who never feared the face of man, and we hope another edition will be restored to its integrity.
Theodore Parker was born in August, 1810, the youngest of eleven children. Seventh in descent from the first settler of the name—Thomas Parker, who came to New England in 1635—his forefathers were flourishing and reliable men, one of whom, in 1710, migrated from the paternal homestead in Reading, and established himself at Lexington. The lineage here becomes historical. Captain John Parker ( who had served in the French War, and been at the taking of Quebec,) and his troop of seventy men, it was who first resisted the British troops, and inaugurated the war of the Revolution. The "King's arm," which he took from a grenadier of the Forty-Third Regiment—the first weapon captured in the Revolution—stood always by the study door of his grandson, Theodore, whose last literary work was the commencement of an autobiography wherein are commemorated the home and ancestral influences that impressed themselves on his youthful character. A delightful fragment it is, a true cabinet picture, showing the life of a Massachusetts farmer's family, born to toil, but not debased by it, and open to all opportunities for culture that might at any time present themselves. Grave, thoughtful, serious, was the general tone of society, varied by individual peculiarities. The father of Theodore was well-read and intelligent—an ingenious mechanist of no ordinary skill—his mother a woman of acute nervous sensibility and active religious instincts, which found their healthiest development in loving and ennobling views of creation and its Divine Author. Incalculable was the effect of his early surroundings.
In his latest year, her son says:—
"Religion was the inheritance my mother gave— gave me in my birth—gave me in her teachings. Many sons have been better born than I; few have had so good a mother. I mention these things to show you how I came to have the view of religion that I have now. My head is not more natural to my body, has not more grown with it, than my religion out of my soul, and with it, with me, religion was not carpentry—something built up of dry wood from without—but it was growth, growth of a germ in my soul."
Under these happy auspices, the youth of Theodore went joyously on. His ear was early attuned to the music of nature, and his eye drank in greedily the ever-changing charm of the unspeakable rural solitudes where his lot was cast. Books, too were not wanting even at that early day, in the New England home. He says: " Homer and Plutarch I read before I was eight; Rollin's Ancient History about the same time, and lots of histories, with all the poetry I could find, before ten. I took to metaphysics about eleven or twelve." The thirst for knowledge grew upon him, and gradually became an overmastering passion. Farm-labors occupied the year, except eleven weeks in winter, when he attended school. Latin and Greek he was " started in " by the kindness of a teacher, whom be always remembered with gratitude, at the district school. With the proceeds of a whortleberrying campaign, carried to Boston for sale, 1822, he bought his first book. One quarter's instruction at the Lexington
<C04>
Academy was all the tuition he received in addition to the winter lessons of the district school. Here Colburn's Algebra was mastered in twenty days, As is the custom in New England, teaching now filled the winters, but was combined with learning, and at this period he found time to acquire French and Spanish. So passed his days until his twentieth year, when
"In the summer of 1830, the day before his birthday, he went away from home, and was absent till near midnight. He had received permission from his father to be gone for a day, but was unwilling to say wherefore, so nobody knew where he had gone. Returning, he went up to his father's bedside and said, Father, I entered Harvard College to-day.’ He had spent the whole day in undergoing examination at Cambridge. The perplexity of the old man at his mysterious absence was not lessened when be heard the cause. Why, Theodore, you know I cannot support you there.' I know that, father. I mean to stay at home, and keep up with my class.' He had quietly prepared to enter the freshman class. He remained at home another winter, doing all his work, carrying on his studies, and going down to Cambridge to participate in the examination. In 1850 he wrote, It is this day twenty years since I entered Harvard College. What misgivings I had at that time! yet how joyfully I went home, and told my father, abed, but not asleep, that I had entered Harvard College. How joyfully I went to work again the next day.'“
This was the turning point of his career; in another season end the home-life and education of the youthful student; but there is no chasm, no harsh separation of feeling and interest between boyhood and manhood. Theodore Parker's days were, happily for him, “" linked each to each by natural piety.”." When near the term of his career, he could look back thankfully, and say:
" I have swum in clear sweet waters all my days, and if sometimes they were a little cold, and the stream ran adverse, and something rough, it was never too strong to be breasted and swum through. From the days of earliest boyhood, when I went stumbling through the grass 'as merry as a May bee,' up to the gray-headed manhood of this time, there is none but has left me honey in the hive of memory that I now feed on for present delight. When I recall the years of boyhood, youth, early manhood, I am filled with a sense of sweetness and wonder that such little things can make a mortal so exceeding rich.”
An engagement as assistant in a private school at Boston awaited him when he left his father's house, “" a raw boy with clothes made by country tailors, coarse shoes, great hands, red lips and blue eyes, carrying with him eleven cherished volumes, the dii majores of his little library, to teach Latin, Greek, French and Spanish, mathematics, and all sorts of philosophy,” for his board and fifteen dollars a month, eleven of which went to pay a hired man to replace him in the work of his father's farm. The seven hours of school-labor over left him, he calculated, ten or twelve for his private studies—a dangerous indulgence, which nature tardily avenged, that fatally sapped the stock of health inherited from six generations of hardy New England farmers, and laid the foundation for premature disease and decay. In after life, when suffering had begun, speaking of these years, he says:—
"You may judge what sort of a boy I was from the kind of man you have known since. Life lay before me then, (it is all behind me now,) and I had hope, when now is only remembrance. Judge if I did not work! It makes my flesh creep to think how I used to work, and how much I learned that year and the four next. Had I not the constitution for a scholar? Oh! that I had known the art of life, or found some book or some man to tell me how to live, to study, to take exercise, etc. But I found none, and so here I am.”
The dull routine of this Boston employ was agreeably diversified by two years school-keeping at Watertown, Mass. Here he found intellectual society and rejoiced in the scholarly companionship of a learned divine, Dr. FRANCIS, who could pilot him through the mazes of German philosophy and theology. Here, also, he made the acquaintance of the lady, Miss LYDIA D. CABOT, who afterward became his wife. At the end of that time, he reckoned he had money enough to venture with to the Theological School at Cambridge, when a frugal youth could live for less than two hundred dollars a year, all expenses included—having also the resources afforded by teaching and writing for further reliance. He accordingly entered the school in 1834. It was, of course, under Unitarian guidance, and numbered the most eminent men of that denomination among the professors, as Dr. PALFREY, HENRY WARE, etc. His course there was marked by his usual intensity of study. The languages he mastered at this time were Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Icelandic, Chaldaic, Arabic, Persian, Coptic, Anglo-Saxon, Swedish, and a smattering of Ethiopia and Russian. He had a class of students in Hebrew, (his knowledge of 0 that language being so minute that he was often refer red to by the Professor, SIDNEY WILLARD.) and also took private pupils. He delivered lectures wrote much for periodicals, and was, in short, engaged in a ceaseless round of mental activity. In 1836, the great ambition of his youthful life was accomplished, and he stood before a congregation of0 worshippers, in the old meeting-house of Water town, an ordained minister of the Gospel.
From his early boyhood, Theodore Parker declares, “ I felt I was to be a minister, and looked for ward with eager longings for the work to which I think my nature itself an effectual call—certainly a deep and continuous one.” The abiding impressions derived from the moral and religious culture of home were mingled in him with a singular hardihood of speculation, and an impatience of received dogma, that he also traces to an ancestral source. It is a curious fact that the Parkers, though men of local influence, dignified with places of trust, and enjoying the respect of the community, were not famous for orthodoxy. In several generations, one member of the family only ever joined the church. These facts, which are opposed to our current notions of New England society, had an unconscious weight with Theodore, and aroused him, when only a boy, to-*investigations of the boldest character. His psychological history is given at length in one of his latest writings—the letter to the members of his society in Boston, entitled “" Theodore Parker's Experience as a Minister,” a paper of the highest interest. From this it appears, that discarding by degrees all traditional authority, and exercising to the fullest extent as a youth that sublime confidence in the truth of his intuitions that always characterized him as a man, he had early evolved, by a process of his own, the doctrines that his future life was to develop. In a remarkable passage, he says:—
"I found certain great primal institutions of human nature, which depend on no logical process of demonstration, but are rather facts of consciousness given by the instinctive action of human nature itself. will mention only the three most important which pertain to religion:
"I. The instinctive intuition of the divine—a consciousness that there is a God.
" II. The instinctive intuition of the just and right —a consciousness that there is a moral law, independent of our will, which we ought to keep.
"III. The instinctive intuition of the immortal—a consciousness that the essential element of man, the principle of individuality, never dies.
"Here, then, was the foundation of religion laid in human nature itself, which neither the atheist nor the more pernicious bigot could move or even shake.”
These intuitions, established after great spiritual trial, were the corner-stones of his future teaching; from them he deduced the great ethical realities— what God actually is, and what morality is, and what eternal life has to offer. They were to him the lever that ARCHIMEDES in vain desired, the extra mundane stand-point from whence he could move the world. His youth has been dwelt upon from the delight which such an example always inspires, and because an example so ennobling cannot be too much insisted on. His ministerial career must be more briefly touched.
On the longest day of 1837, Theodore Parker was ordained minister of the Unitarian Church and congregation of West Roxbury, a suburban village near Boston. One of the smallest societies in New England, there was little in the situation to tempt an ambitious man; to Mr. Parker it offered what, with his moderate ideas, seemed a competence, combining also the mental advantages of immediate proximity to the social and intellectual life of the metropolis. Just married, “" with an income of five hundred and twenty dollars a year, may be— may be much less—to support a wife,” the quiet little parish of some sixty families, and the pleasant white parsonage-house, “ looking through trees upon flowers, vines, and garden buds,” was a delightful retreat, where official duties were not so overwhelming but that ample time was secured for study and the pursuit of knowledge. His journals and correspondence testify to the extent of his researches in learning of all kinds, ancient and modern, sacred and profane, and what was to be the noble library, grew insensibly by constant, if moderate, ac-
<C05>
cessions. A man of this stamp could not exist in contact with the stereotyped theology of slumbering and plethoric sects without rudely disturbing many prejudices; and intimations of the heterodoxy of Parker gradually gamed ground among his Unitarian brethren, who seemed anxious to visit on the head of a kindred offender the wrath and indignation-sometimes showered on themselves by the orthodox. His ecclesiastical position and relations grew precarious—and some of his oldest friends, unable to share or appreciate his clearness of mental vision, were among his denouncers. In 1841, a sermon preached at the ordination of a minister at South Boston, and afterward entitled “"Discourse of the Transient and Permanent in Religion,”." was regarded as an overt act of treason to the obligations of his profession. The outcry it made was startling—”-" Most of my clerical friends fell off (says Parker); some would not speak to me in the street, and refused to take me by the hand; in their pubic meetings, they left the sofas or benches where I sat down, and withdrew from me as Jews from contact with a leper. In a few months most of my former ministerial coadjutors forsook me, and there were only six who would allow me to enter into heir pulpits.”." The-controlling men of the denomination determined “" this young man must be silenced”— but they had not understood the person they were dealing with. His words are: “"I had not gone to war without calculating the cost. I 1 well new beforehand what awaited me, and had determined to fight the battle through, and never thought of yielding or being silenced.” The immediate effect of this ecclesiastical proscription was to remove him to a wider field. Influential men in Boston were unwilling to condemn a man or his doctrines unheard, and in the autumn of 1841, he delivered in that city the “" Lectures on Matters Pertaining to Religion,”," which, first widely circulated by newspaper reports, and afterward published in a volume, carried the fame of the author far beyond the local limits that had heretofore bounded it. The impression was deepened by his “" Sermon for the Times,”," also delivered in Boston during the following season; but here his health gave way, and in September, 1843, he “ fled off to Europe to spend a ear in recovery, observation, and thought.”." Few Americans have ever started on a similar tour so well qualified to realize the advantages it presents. To Theodore Parker, this involuntary year of rest and inaction turned out the most profitable in his life. To a mind so furnished, this episode of European travel was a continuous dream of delight. His letters and journals show him observant of everything. In Paris, attending lectures on Arabic, CORNEILLE, CICERO, DESCARTES, and GASSENDIS' philosophy, law of nature and nations, Italian literature, etc., etc., his journal—written in French by way of exercise—containing an analysis of every lecture heard beard, from COUSIN at the Sorbonne, to GEOFFRY St. HILAIRE, at the Garden of Plants, “"on Vultures.”." In Italy classical antiquities and the fine arts specially attracted him, the paintings and public buildings rising far above his imagination, the statues falling a little below it. Here, too, his large charity made him a tolerant and sympathetic critic of much that he found valuable in the imposing ideal of the Catholic Church, and he eagerly studied the practical working of its system on the minds and morals of men. In Germany the attractions of art gave way to those of humanity, and he gladly made acquaintance with the professors and divines, with whose works he had long been familiar. SCHLOSSER, “ " a fine old gentleman, who writes history for amusement, scorning equally money and renown;” GERVINUS, “who, they say, has read more books than any man in Germany;”;" DE WETTE, “a compact little man, with rather a dry face, a little irritable from his long disasters”" (whose Biblical Introduction he had just translated); EWALD, “"the hard-headed, more a man of genius than any one else seen in Germany;”;" HUMBOLDT, “" sleeping on his laurels;”;" SCHELLING,”, " old and feeble, almost inarticulate;” PAULUS, “a noble old fellow, eighty-three years old, hale and flourishing yet,”," are only a few of the celebrities that were met with, and characterized to friends in his sharp incisive manner. In England, be takes tea with CARLYLE, dines with Professor NEWMAN, breakfasts with BABBAGE, meets JOHN STERLING —then “" near the skies”— "—and is especially observant at Oxford of the religious' phenomena of the day, then taking the form known as Puseyism.
Returning home, he renewed his relation with the little flock at West Roxbury, but only for a season. The fame of THEODORE PARKER had gone forth, aided, perhaps, as much by the denunciations of his persecutors as by the admiration he excited among those who really knew him. There is a native generosity in most cultivated minds that reacts at the idea of condemning a man unheard, and in obedience to a professional clamor. Recounting the origin of the congregation henceforward the scene of his ministerial labor, he says: “" A few earnest men thought the great principle of religious freedom was endangered; some of you came together, privately at first, and then in public, to look matters in the face, and consider what ought to be done. A young man proposed this resolution:—
"'Resolved, That the Rev. THEODORE PARKER shall have a chance to be heard in Boston.'
That motion prevailed, and measures were soon taken to make the resolution an event, but so low was our reputation, that though payment was offered in advance, of all the unoccupied halls in Boston, but one could be hired for our purpose. So, one rainy Sunday, the streets full of snow, on the 16th of February, 1845, for the first time, I stood before you to preach and pray.”
Mr. Parker was then in his thirty-fifth year. The society was formally organized in the following January, and he was installed over it. Their first place of meeting was the Melodeon; but the full development of the congregation was not reached until their removal to the new Music Hall, in November, 1852. A friend and parishioner says, feelingly: “Those early days of his ministry at the Melodeon can never be forgotten by those favored to share them. The dark, dingy building, with dirty walls and close atmosphere, became a holy temple, for it contained a living soul.”." In the ampler space and more elegant arrangement of the Music Hall, the relation of the preacher to his bearers was changed; he had become public property; the small body of his regular parishioners formed a little nucleus around which gathered the customary audience, frequently of three thousand souls, attracted to the simple service by the certainty of hearing from the minister no words of dubious or uncertain sound on all the great questions that agitate humanity, whether of private conduct or public polity. How in time, when occupying this position, he came to be almost regarded as a separate estate in the commonwealth—a power that could counterbalance the accidents that might for the time legalize wrong and aggression, need not here be told. The Mexican War, the Fugitive Slave Law, the Kansas and Nebraska Bill, found him a true “" tribune of the people,”," giving expression, in his single trumpet-tones, to the thoughts, that silently swelled the bosoms of thousands. Here for fifteen years was the scene of his ministry; and while health allowed, no desire of change, no fickleness of purpose, ever for a moment was entertained. How dear to him was the twenty-eighth society is unconsciously testified by the casual expressions of almost every letter or paper that came from his pen. The mutual dependence of pastor and people, and his conception of ministerial duties, are well exemplified in his farewell letter, where, addressing his congregation, he says:—
" When I first came among you, and lived in a trading town where a great variety of occupations lay spread out before me all the time, and preached to such crowds of men as offered a wide diversity of nature, character, and conduct, I found not only an opportunity to work, but also to learn and grow. You say I have taught you much. I hope it is so; but you have been a large part of your own schooling, for I have also learned much from you. The audience has always furnished a large part of the sermon and the prayer. I have received much direct instruction, and that in matters of deep concern, from some of you, by hearing your words and looking at your lives. The indirect help to my power, I fear you would hardly credit should I attempt to tell. It is enough to say now that I have found amongst you men and women, often in quite humble stations, who have added new elements of strength and beauty to my notion of what constitutes a glorious human creature, in particular excellencies their actual surpassing my ideal. I have been a learner quite as much as a teacher. Indeed, out of nearly a thousand sermons I have written, I think there are not five and twenty which are not steps in my own development, studies I have learned by quite as much at lessons you have been taught with.”
The exercise of his professional fraction was, however, but one element in the intellectual life of Theodore Parker. On accepting the pastorate of his congregation, he removed from the country., and established his household in a town residence—Exeterplace , Boston. Here was arranged the library, originally limited to the fourth story, but gradually over-
<C06>
flowing other rooms, passages, and halls of the house , finally pausing only at the dining-room, close to the front door. In a cosy nook, with the implements of work all around him, sat the owner and collector of the twelve thousand volumes, cognizant of the individuality of each one, "as a shepherd knows his sheep.”." Here was he occupied, with the care of a wider parish, limited by no geographical bounds, but composed of the grateful minds who acknowledged their obligation to his writings, the inquirer who looked to him for counsel, the doubting who required the confidence of his strong convictions. England, Scotland, Germany, and the Far West, largely swelled his correspondence of this nature, which in extent and variety of station among the writers probably exceeded that of any public man of the time. His published writings also demanded much care; though apparently struck off in an extempore heat of composition, they were never slighted, but always as good as he could possibly make them. Matter, too, was constantly collecting for important works destined never to see the light. His lecturing campaigns also extended over much ground, and occupied a portion of every year. For many years the lectures he delivered averaged nearly fifty in number each season
But above all, and interpenetrating through all this ceaseless round of occupation, was the love of the acquisition of knowledge for its own sake—a passion-that knew neither stop nor stay. How the mind of Theodore Parker drank eagerly at every source, and embraced and harmonized all fields of inquiry, is beautifully illustrated in his own words:—
"To me human life in all its forms, individual and aggregate, is a perpetual wonder; the flora of the earth and sea is full of beauty and of mystery, which science seeks to understand; the fauna of land and ocean is in not less wonderful—-the world which holds them both, and the great universe which enfolds it on every side are still more wonderful, complex, and attractive to the contemplating mind. But the universe of human life, with its peculiar worlds of outer sense and inner soul, the particular faunas and floras which therein find a home, are still more complex, wonderful, and attractive, and the laws which control it seem to me more amazing than the mathematics principles that explain the celestial mechanics of the outward world. The <illegible> of matter seems little compared to this kosmos of immortal and progressive man; it is my continual study, discipline and delight. Oh that some young genius would devise the novum organum of humanity, determine the principia thereof, and, with deeper than mathematic science, write all the formulas of the human universe-the celestial mechanics of mankind!”
So passed on fifteen happy years, rich in the full and vigorous exercise of matured talent, in the domestic affections, and in the love and esteem of enlightened men. Visions of a calm and studious retirement, a long, quiet, mellow Autumn season, dedicated to the welfare of his fellow0-men, began to mingle with the unintermitted toil of every day; but it was not to be. The strong man was suddenly stricken down. At the commencement of 1859, decided symptoms of consumption manifested themselves in his overwrought frame, and henceforward the struggle for existence necessarily shared his concern with the great interests of humanity. With characteristic energy, he scorned the thought of submission to the insidious disease. His chance of full recovery was pronounced by his physicians to be as "one to ten.” On this his journal says: “I mean to live, and not die. I laugh at the odds of nine to one; if that is all, I’ll conquer. I have fought ninety-nine against one-yes, nine hundred and ninety-nine against one, and conquered; please God, I will again.” His last sermon was preached on January 2."What Religion may do for a man-a sermon for the New Year". In the hope of averting the progress of the disease, a voyage to the West Indies was undertaken in the following months. Though, in his own phraseology, ”fleeing from death, all my life-schemes prostrate, I stand up to my chin in my grave,” his letters from Santa Cruz and St. Thomas show all his old geniality. They are full of raillery, and, above all, of the old home-feeling that would gladly exchange the riches of tropical vegetation for “"a square rod of Boston Common, with green grass, white clover, and dandelions.” Only questionable benefit being derived from the equatorial climate, Mr. Parker sailed for Southampton in May. The succeeding last year of his life stands out in melancholy contrast with his former visit to Europe, though the invincible energies of the man shone more brightly than ever, when his unsatiated thirst for knowledge is compared with his feeble and wasted frame. No portion of his correspondence is equal in information, variety, and new and striking observations to these leave-taking words. The year was spent, with alternating seasons of hope and depression, in France, Switzerland, and Italy, till at last the end came at Florence, where, in the Protestant Cemetery, an unadorned inscription records: “Theodore Parker, born at Lexington, Mass., United States of America, Aug. 24,1810. Died at Florence, May 10, 1860.”
In this brief personal sketch, no indication has been given of the stores of varied information contained in the journals and correspondence of Theodore Parker and his friends; a selection of "Ana," or Table-Talk, might be made from them equal in value to anything of the kind now extant.—-New York Times.

She Champoos with a bark which does not grow in this country, and which is highly beneficial to the hair before using the Restorative, and will prevent the hair from turning grey.
She also has another for restoring grey hair to its natural color in nearly all cases. She is not afraid to speak of her Restoratives in any part of the world, as they are used in every city in the country. They are also packed for her customers to take to Europe with them, enough to last two or three years, as they often say they can get nothing abroad like them.

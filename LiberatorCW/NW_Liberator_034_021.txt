THIRTYFIRST ANNIVERSARY
OF THE
AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY
[Phonographically reported by JAS. M. W. YERRINTON.]
The Thirty-first Anniversary of the American Anti-Slavery Society was celebrated on Tuesday and Wednesday of last week, at the Church of the Puritans, and Cooper Institute, by several meetings, the first of which was held at 10 o'clock on Tuesday, at the Church, WM. LLOYD GARRISON, the President of the Society, in the chair. Among the friends of the Society on the platform were George Thompson, Wendell Phillips, Edmund Quincy, Samuel May, Jr., John Rankin, Thomas Garrett, Revs. O. B. Frothingham, John T. Sargeant, and Antoinette L. Blackwell, James and Lucretia Mott, Oliver Johnson, J. Miller McKim, Miss Susan B. Anthony, Wm. Wells Brown, and Wm. H. Day. The audience was unusually large, for a morning meeting, and comprised not only very many of the old and long-tried friends of the cause, but large numbers of young men and women, whom the events of the hour have brought into sympathy, more or less hearty, with the radical phase of the Anti-Slavery movement which this Society represents. Not without emotion could one familiar with the great struggle for the freedom of the slave which has been going on this country for thirty years, and more, look over the great audience, and mark the many venerable men and women, their hair silvered with honorable years, who have given their lives with self-sacrificing zeal and noble effort, to the elevation of an outcast and despised race, patiently laboring, amid derision and obloquy and reproach, to lay the foundations of that Temple of Liberty to which the multitude now come up to lay the capstone with shoutings. For long and weary years they struggled, "their faith triumphant over fears," until, at this hour, it is given them to see the fruition of their hopes near at hand, and their abiding faith in a God of justice" and liberty gloriously vindicated. A fitting prelude to the exercises of the meeting was the voluntary which the organist (Prof. Sigismund Lasar) played-the good old tune of "Lenox"-The year of jubilee has come."
Mr. GARRISON commenced the exercises by reading the following hymn, by THEODORE TILTON, which was sung by the choir:-
O Thou, before whose throne we fall,
Who bendest to the bended knee,
Who spurnest none, who lovest all,-
How long, O God, from land and sea,
Shall yet the groaning nations call?
O Thou, by whom the lost are found,
Whose Cross, upraised, forever stands,
When shall its shadow on the ground
Spread East and West through all the lands,
Until it gird the world around?
O Thou, who makest kingdoms Thine,
When shall thy mighty arms outreach
From Southern palm to Northern pine,
To bind each human heart to each,
And each to Thee as branch to vine?
O Thou, who cleansest human sin,
For whom the whole creation waits,
When shall thy reign on earth begin?-
O be ye lifted up, ye gates,
And let the King of Glory in!
The PRESIDENT then read the following significant passages from the 50th and 51st chapters of Jeremiah:-
"The word that the Lord spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet. Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not; say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces. For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein; they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast. In those days and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the Lord their God. They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten. My people hath been lost sheep; their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting place. All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the Lord, the habitation of justice, even the Lord, the hope of their fathers. Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks. For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken; their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain. And Chaldea shall be a spoil; all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the Lord. A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! How is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! I have lain a share for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the Lord. The Lord hath opened his armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans. Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left. Stay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God, the vengeance of his temple.
Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let some thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel. Therefore shall her young be cut off in that day, saith the Lord. Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord God of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visible. And the most proud shall stumble and fall, had none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him. A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the Lord, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men. A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed. A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her: and they shall became as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed. A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up; for it is the
<c02>
land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols. Babylon hath been a golden cap in the Lord's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad. Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed; howl for her: take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed. We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed; forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country; for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and lifted up even to the skies. O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness. The Lord of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillars: and they shall lift up a shout against thee. For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor, it is time to thresh her; yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come. Thus saith the Lord of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refuse to let them go. Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name; he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon."
The PRESIDENT said-We meet this morning under very cheering and hopeful circumstances, in view of what comes to us from the battle-field. The rebellion is reeling to its overthrow, and the cause which is dear to all our hearts-is in full promise of triumphant success-the cause of impartial and glorious liberty. (Applause.) It is obviously proper, at this time, to read the following proclamation of the President of the United States:-
EXECUTIVE MANSION, 
WASHINGTON, May 9, 1864. 
To the Friends of Union and Liberty:
Enough is known of army operations within the last few days to claim our especial gratitude to God. While what remains undone demands our most sincere prayers to, and reliance upon, him without whom all human effort is vain, I recommend that all patriots at their homes, in their places of public worship, and wherever they may be, unite in common thanksgiving and prayer to Almighty God.
(signed) ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
And so, from the beginning, the prophecy has been sure of fulfilment in the end; for 
"Freedom’s battle once begun,
Bequeathed from bleeding sire to son,
Though baffled oft, is ever won."
A fervent and impressive prayer was then offered by Rev. O. B. FROTHINGHAM; after which, another hymn was sung, as follows:-
Out of the dark the circling sphere
Is rounding onward to the light;
We see not yet the full day here,
But we do see the paling night; 
And Hope, that lights her fadeless fires, 
And Faith, that shines, a heavenly will, 
And Love, that courage re-inspires-
These stars have been above us still. 
Look backward, how much has been won! 
Look round, how much is yet to win! 
The watches of the night are done; 
The watches of the day begin. 
O Thou, whose mighty patience holds 
The night and day alike in view, 
Thy will our dearest hopes enfolds; 
O keep us steadfast, patient, true! 
The PRESIDENT then read a series of resolutions, which were laid over to be acted upon at the business meetings. 
The PRESIDENT-You will now be addressed by one who has never spoken, primarily, for the sake of receiving the applause of his friends, and who has never hesitated to speak all that was in him, in view of the opposition and contumely of his enemies. I have the pleasure of introducing WENDELL PHILLIPS, Esq., of Boston. (Prolonged applause.) 

SPEECH OF WENDELL PHILLIPS, ESQ. 
MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: Those who follow me will probably find ample text for what they have to say to you to-day in the very eloquent and excellent resolutions which have just been read to us. For myself, I beg leave to address what I shall say to you this morning, to a resolution which I ask leave to read:-
Resolved, That while we do not criticise the wishes of the Administration, still, as Abolitionists, we feel bound to declare that we see no evidence of its purpose to put the freedom of the negro on such a basis as will secure it against every peril. 
I recollect, Mr. President, and will endeavor to bear steadily in mind, that we come here this morning as Abolitionists; that this platform is sacred to the claims of the negro; that, so far as possible, we throw out of consideration here all those general interests which concern us only as citizens; and that as far as may be, we confine ourselves to those things which interest us as pledged to secure the abolition of chattel slavery. Still, I confess it is hardly possible, in such an hour as this, that one should totally forget that he has interests broader than those which concern merely the abolition of slavery. With the cannon shot echoing from the borders of Virginia, with the best blood and bravest of the nation poured out like water in defence of Republican institutions, with a great weight resting on the nation, the terrible burden which God gives it to-day, to save by the sacrifice of all its material wealth, if necessary, and its best blood, the institutions bequeathed to us by our fathers, it is impossible not to call to mind that even we Abolitionists, pledged to so sacred an object, have not only the right, but are bound to remember that that object, high and sacred as it is, is to be secured by the most economical means, by the slightest possible peril to the liberty of the white man, by the lightest mortgage laid on the industry of the future, by the slightest possible submission to the inevitable despotism of war, accustoming the public mind to the liberal exercise of despotic power, until at last vigilance, and the keen sense of individual right, and the sacredness of the bulwarks of personal liberty are lost in the din of battle. All these considerations we, even as Abolitionists, have a right to bear in mind. Standing, therefore, as we do this hour, with the news (if it can be credited) of the greatest success of the whole three years, before which, as our President has well said, the rebellion reels, it is still to be borne in mind that we have already incurred a debt, that we have already sacrificed an amount of life, that we have already blunted the old vigilance for individual liberty to an extent that bids us, as American citizens, beware that no such trial shall ever again be needed by the Republic. This war, if the intelligence and virtue of the people can secure it, is to be the last-at least, between the two sections of the
<c03>
American Union. It is very problematical whether any such war could be borne a second time, and free institutions survive it, in this belt of the continent. When I look, therefore, at the abolition of slavery, I connect with it, inevitably, the perpetuity of Republican institutions. In that dark and fearful storm into which the vessel of state is plunging, no man has foresight enough to see when she will reach the still water. The youngest of us are never again to see that Republic into which we were born; it is to be largely biased by such a civil war as this. A million of men are to come back into civil life half unfitted for citizenship by the habits of a camp. They are to bring with them from five to ten thousand idolized officers-the only available candidates for office for a century to come. Military ambition, biased toward military occupation-the grave of all free governments-is the maelstrom on one side of us; and on the other, debt-the other grave of free governments. Two thousand millions of dollars is the debt of our government to-day; three thousand million probably the ultimate debt of State, county and town, and war damages; an annual expense of three hundred million beyond our debt interest to keep that standing army with us, which will be inevitably necessary on any plan of reconstruction. Under that mortgage rests the labor of the next half-century. Every living right hand is mortgaged, and every one to be born for the next twenty years, for the atonement which God has demanded for the sin of our fathers. Hitherto, the charm of American liberty has been the surplusage of its means. When an American artisan reached Saturday night, after he had paid his rent, his clothing and his food, he had a half or a third of his wages left-ample material for books, for lectures, for amusements, for newspapers, for travel, for the education of his children. The Austrian prays to-day, in the streets of Vienna, "God grant I may be as well off to-morrow as I was yesterday!" No Yankee ever breathed such a prayer. Every Monday morning, he commenced life better than he started the week before. This has been the fulcrum and the spring-board which elevated the labor of the North into intellectual and moral life. This surplus dollar was pulpit, college, academy, impulse, and lifted labor to a higher level than the rest of the world knew. The English artisan, (speaking generally,) when he reaches Saturday night, has spent his last dollar for food, rent, clothing, and begins Monday morning almost as hopeless as the previous. Now, to long as the results of this war last, so long as the inevitable necessities of the government for twenty years to come are to take one-third, if not one-half of the average 
Income of the capital of the country to defray its expenses, so long the laboring masses of the Northern States are robbed of just the surplusage which constituted its nucleus of intellectual and moral progress. 
I look out upon our future, therefore, as one vastly momentous in the history of republican government. A comparatively ignorant laboring class, a large body of fund-holders-in the history of all free States the source of corruption and the grave of independence-these are the dead-weight, these are the lee-shore and maelstrom in which the o'er laden frigate struggles for the harbor. What I ask of American citizens, interested alike in twenty millions of white men and four millions of black-in the providence of God in one bottom, sinking or swimming together-is, remembering the danger on the right hand and the left, to clear the decks, sweep every possible obstacle from our pathway, if in the providence of God, by any possibility, we may save the liberty of the whole, and the free institutions bequeathed to us. 
 Over all this picture looms the cloud of a government habituated to the exercise of despotic power. Well did Seward say to Lord Lyons, "I but ring a bell on this side, and, unchallenged, I put in prison a New Englander; I ring another one on that, and, equally irresponsible, consign a citizen of Ohio to a dungeon." No such despotism this side the wall of China. Necessary-inevitable-not to be found fault with in this death-grapple with rebellion. But all the more earnestly does it become us to remember that such powers, if trusted to less worthy hands, may result in the speedy dismemberment of the republic, or the quick advance of despotism.
 In looking, therefore, at our question, let us remember that it is on a platform girdled by these dangers that we discuss the abolition of slavery to-day. I recognize as gladly as any man, as proudly as any man, the valor and the skill of the Army of the Potomac, and its matchless chief. (Loud applause.) I believe that Grant will go to the Gulf when he plans to (renewed applause,) and plant the stars and stripes again triumphant on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico (Continued applause.) But I believe it will be done over battle-fields as bloody as that which he treads to-day; for, though the rebellion reels in Virginia, it is by no means broken when it quits the Old Dominion. We have learned-the sections of the country-at least to respect each other. We know the South; its unanimity; its decided purpose; its willingness to die for its idea. We know its readiness for every sacrifice; its indomitable pride. Those elements are not to be subdued by a single battle; no, nor by three such. I believe, therefore, that although we beat the rebellion out of Virginia, it will still live. The war is to last many months longer. In considering our question, therefore, we are to consider, fairly, the next four years; and my resolution points the discriminating judgment of Abolitionists at the Administration, in fall view of that fact, and in full view of the fact, that this Summer the country is to say under what philosophy the war shall be conducted. The popular cry is, "Stand by the Administration!" (Loud applause.) I recognize it. It has a broad, deep, patriotic meaning. Stand by the Administration! It is every man’s duty, every citizen’s duty, to stand by the Administration. (Applause.) But remember, Mr. President, we are American, ‘not European. we live under he Constitution of the United States, not under French or English rule; and our fathers have laid it down as the safest, wisest principle of government, that every four years the citizen shall summon the government before himself, try it, and record his verdict. Every four years an administration comes before the people to ask, like the old prophet, "What have I done wrong? Whom have I injured?" It summons the judgment of the community. We are not only at liberty, but, as American citizens, we are bound to say to the pilot of the last four years,
<c04>
either, "You are," or "You are not my pilot for the coming four years." Any man, therefore, who raises to-day the war-cry, "Stand by the Administration!" and does not take into the account that limitation-that an American citizen is bound to stand by the Administration so far and so long as the Constitution allows him, and no longer-forfeits his franchise under the free institutions of the fathers, and binds his lips, like a vassal of the Czar, to a life-long allegiance. (Applause.)
If you think such a privilege dangerous, if you think the exercise of such a right inexpedient, there is the Constitution of the United States—assail it, but leave me untouched! There is the Convention of ’89-attack it, but leave me uncensured! There is the fundamental principle of American institutions-deny it, but leave me uncriticised! I am only a constitutional American citizen, treading in the footsteps of the fathers of the Republic, and denying that any man has a life-long right to office. (Applause.) The hour summons us, therefore, to the discharge of this duty, and no thoughtful citizen has a right to evade it. As an Abolitionist, I feel the deepest interest in the exercise of it.
I should not say this, if I thought this was a common war, to be decided by battle. If America was at this moment engaged in a quarrel with Mexico, if our bayonets were marshalled against those of France, I should stay at home and say, "Grant is as good as anybody and a little better; I will trust to the cannon shot that he manages." But if our success carries the banner down to the Gulf, you have not yet finished the war of ideas; you have not yet completed the struggle between Northern and Southern civilization. The Hon. L. W. Spratt said at Montgomery, at that Convention which launched the Confederacy, when he was called upon to announce its programme. "This is no geographical quarrel. This is no quarrel between the men of the North and the men of the South-they are cordial enough. It is a war between the civil institutions of one section and the civil institutions of the other section. It is an eagle and a fish tied together by indissoluble bonds. The eagle cannot live in the fluid suited to the fish, and the fish cannot live in the fluid suited to the eagle. One must perish that the other may survive." (Applause.) Every thoughtful Northerner accepts the conclusion. We have reached that ultimate goal, when the ideas of the North and of the South come in conflict;" one must perish that the other may survive!" In other words, unless the South supersedes us, we must supersede the South. I believe in God and Democracy, and therefore I believe that ultimately, in that final close of the epoch, the North, representing Justice and Democracy, will surely give law to this belt of the continent. (Applause.) I have not a doubt of it. God reigns. The inevitable gravitation of all time is toward universal suffrage and universal democracy. It will not be different on this continent from what it has been on the other, and in due time, that will be accomplished. The only question is, "How long?" Shall it come when we call home the cannon and furl the banner, or shall it come twenty-five or thirty years hence, after an experience of Mexican civilization? Will you adjourn the conflict from the battle-field in Virginia, where we conquer, to the Senate house, where we are always betrayed? That is the only question for the American people. My charge against the Administration, as an Abolitionist, is, that it seeks to adjourn the battle from cannon shot to the forum; from Grant to the Senate-house; and to leave the poisoned remnants of the slave system for a quarter of a century to come. If I was a negro and a slave, I should pray God that this war might last twenty years; if I was a negro and a slave, I should dread every victory on the part of the North; for I believe that this war, while it lasts, is performing exactly that work which war did in South America. It is taking the rivets out of society; it is crumbling up the whole civil and social life into its original elements; and when that work is completely done, no matter what may be the form of government that follows, the negro is always free. Witness Mexico and South America. War stalked from the Gulf to the Cape, sweeping all institutions out of her path; and when peace came, the negro, like every other man, had a hand in the reconstruction of the government. But, as a white man, as an American citizen, concerned in the welfare of white as well as black, I deprecate one month of war, because I see in it the seeds of debt, military ambition and despotism, to guard against which will demand a virtue and an intelligence in the masses such as history nowhere shows. I accept, therefore, with gratitude the first step that the Administration made, in December, towards reconstruction; not that I deem it a wise one, not that I deem it a quite well-timed one, in all its parts; but because I am well aware that the settlement of this war is not to be by battle, but by statesmanship, by the reconstruction of the elements of States; and, therefore, the greatest cause of anxiety is not for the battle-field-we can have nothing there but victory in the end-but it is for the intelligence of the hand that shall finally remodel the Union. Confined as I am out of fairness to those who are to follow me, I must briefly indicate the facts which I wish to bring to your attention on this point.
I have no charge to make against the Administration for the past-no fault to find with it. I am going to find fault only with its philosophy-its reason of procedure. I am going to allow, if you please, that it wishes the abolition of slavery and the freedom of the negro. I am going to allow the best disposition of the heart; all I am going to find fault with is the head. Now, in Mr. Lincoln's letter to Mr. Hodges, as in every one of his papers, if I do not misunderstand him, he lays down this principle: "I would fain reconstruct the Union; and touch slavery only in the last, inevitable resort. I would try everything else; I would exhaust all other means; I would allow time, to give a chance for the opposing parties to come to an understanding; I would exhaust everything before I would touch slavery." If I understand Mr. Lincoln, I do him no injustice in taking this for his philosophy of procedure. Then I think his action in the war shows the counterpart of that principle: "I will not only delay as long as possible touching slavery, but in my reconstruction, I will touch it as lightly as possible. I will merely touch its principle; I will leave everything connected with it in as nearly the same situation as possible.
<c05>
These are the two principles, I think, which have guided the Administration. Let me show you why I think so. On the first, I need not adduce evidence, because Mr. Lincoln’s own letter to Hodges states distinctly-"I put aside Fremont; I put aside Hunter; I expurgated Cameron’s report; I listened for the action of the Border States; I waited the returning reason of the malcontents; I exhausted patience-then I acted." That principle he allows. The second principle-that of touching slavery as lightly as possible, leaving everything connected with it in the same posture-is evinced in his action. Let me show you. The Administration has never yet acknowledged the manhood of the negro. It professes to have abolished chattelism, and the abolition of chattelism leaves manhood. The Administration has never yet acknowledged the manhood of the negro. Go to Gen. Banks’s department-the broadest field of experiment, under the hands of that officer of whom the President says, "He gives me the least trouble, does all I want, and makes no complaint." His department has from 50,000 to 200,000 negroes under our flag. His whole system of orders, from beginning to end, has no one element of the recognition of the manhood of the black in it-no one element of contract. The negro is to serve you; you are to fix his wages-what is he worth; if he is insubordinate, there is the Provost Marshal. No contract- no law-no equity of agreement The negro is a serf, punishable at the will, hireable at the will of the Government. No manhood. Now, if the Proclamation had made a man, then, like the laborer at Port Royal, under Boston influences, he might make his own contract; but there is no negro in Louisiana allowed either to make a contract or choose his residence-not one.
Again, the negro has been summoned into the army. As a white man, I confess that the most humiliating hour that I ever lived, Abolitionist as I am, was when twenty millions of white men, having ground the negro to powder under their proud heels for two hundred years, were obliged, in the death-grapple with the South, to get down and ask the negro to help them fight. (Applause.) But that was only humiliating; what followed was infamous. The Southerner hung him, shot him, bayoneted him, sold him into slavery, treated him like a brute-covered with the blue uniform of the United States. To the farthest borders of Christendom, men listened for one word from the Capitol, and it was dumb. Again, and again, and again, the midnight massacre made the world thrill with horror; and the government was dumb. At last, stirred to fiendish atrocity, white men and black went down in a common massacre under the walls of Fort Pillow; and then at last was launched from the evasive lips of the President the announcement, "If I could only find a case!" "Find a case!" When had the Government made a step of a single inch toward trying to find one? When, with the amplest means in its possession, had it opened one single document, examined one single witness? One Admiral, whose son falls by a guerilla bullet, and tumbles into an unknown grave, quite his post at Charleston, like a true father, the gunboats of the nation are at his service, and he scours the Virginia waters, while we make search through all her hamlets to find news of the dead body of his child. Well done! But when did a single government official, civil or military, quit his post an instant, give up his routine an hour, to find out what became of the massacred soldiers at Port Hudson, or of the dead, brutally bayoneted men at Fort Wagner? Not one! I arraign that speech of the President as the foulest insult to the black race ever uttered on this continent. (Applause and some hisses.) The head of the Confederacy, in the face of Europe, repudiated the money debts of Mississippi, and the world wrote "Repudiator" on his forehead. This Government has repudiated a debt infinitely more binding-the debt of honor to the men whom it had summoned to its side, with halters round their necks, and history will write "Repudiator" on the forehead of the United States. 
I speak as an American citizen, as one of a people who, having called that victim race to their side, and covered it with the United States uniform, deserted it. Now, where do you find the explanation? They have not acknowledged the manhood of the negro. Admiral Dahlgren’s son was a man; the white officers that disappear in sickly jails are men, and government follows them. The vigilant eye and long arm of the War Department searches for them amid the filth and disease in the Libby Prison, and picks them out, man by man, and carries home even the remains to the mother’s heart. Not one negro has ever been sought for, much less found.
But take a different view. Our resolutions say, with great reason, "Thanks to Attorney-General Bates that he has found out that the law of Congress puts the black soldier on a level with the white." I thank him also. But at whose suggestion did he find it out? At whose instance did the indifference of the government move? I will tell you. At the Instance of the. Governor of Massachusetts-tireless, indefatigable, incessant in his appeals to the government to protect the men whom the broad seal of the Commonwealth had summoned into the service of the nation. (Loud applause.) And yet, if the Administration had had a heart; if the Administration had recognized the manhood of the negro, could not they have seen the law as well as Attorney-General Bates? The lawyers of New York, Boston and Philadelphia, the legal profession all through the nation, and Mr. Sumner at the Senate Board, a year ago, asserted, "that law covers the black man as well as the white"; and now, April, 1864, Attorney-General Bates says so. Where was the hitch? Why did not the rest of the government see it? Had they eyes? Yes; but there are certain things you cannot see without a heart, and the Administration had no heart behind its eyes. (Applause.) The law was just as clear when Col. Shaw fell at Fort, Wagner as it is to-day. Massachusetts saw it; the Senate saw it; the legal profession saw it; the only one who could not see it was the pilot who demand that we shall choose him, a second time, to pilot us through the coming storm.
I contend that in all these cases, the government has shown a willingness to let the white race and the black race, and their relations, remain, after this war, as nearly what they were before as possible. That is really the philosophy of the Administration. What McClellan was on the battle-field-" Do as little hurt

as possible!"—that Lincoln is in civil affairs-" Make as little change as possible!"
You may think I am unjust to the Administration; but I have a right, as an American citizen, to say whether my interests and my future shall be committed to such a philosophy, announced this very month in accordance with the wishes of Kentucky, to conciliate slaveholders. "Touch slavery the last thing; touch it the least possible." Very well. If we were at war with France, I should not care much for the philosophy; bullets would settle it. But when I get back Louisiana on this principle, what have I got back? Let me tell you a story. The last fortnight, there were in Boston two representatives of the free colored men of Louisiana-Messrs. Bartonneau and Roudanez. In 1862, Butler said to them: "I cannot defend New Orleans-help me!" They gave him 4,000 men; and I heard Butler say, with his own lips, "They saved me the city." In 1863, Gen. Banks summoned a commission to insult them out of office. Like military men, on every principle of military etiquette, they gave up their commissions. In August, 1863, Shepley said, (Banks was at Port Hudson,) just as Butler did, that he was unable to dafend the city, and said, "White men, help me!" No response. He said to the civil employes of the government, "Volunteer for thirty days to defend the government in this emergency or you lose your offices"; and nineteenths of those men, who had eaten the bread of the government for eighteen months, resigned rather than defend the stars and stripes! That is the Unionism of the whites at New Orleans! Then said Shepley to the black men, whom Banks had insulted out of office, "Save me!" and in seventy hours they gave him two thousand men. (Applause.) He put them into the forts, kept them in the service forty days, saved the city until Banks's return, and then mustered them out, finding every man in debt to the government $6 67 for having saved it! When it was done, the blacks said, "The money is nothing. It seems strange that, having saved the third city in the empire, we should all be owing the nation-but no matter. You say you have twice made us save the city in spite of the Confederates. You are about to reconstruct the Union. Now, having made us twice anger the white, don’t leave us to his mercy. We will make our own way to liberty, only give us the ballot. You thought our hands fit for the musket, when you needed it; in Heaven's name give us the ballot when we need it!" Banks said No; the President said No. The State is to be reconstructed by white men, who went up into the steeples to ask God that they might kiss the bars that they saw in the city-they are to vote, and the black man who saved the steeples for us is to be under their heels! And that is the government.
Now, if we could have Louisiana on that basis, I would be the last man to criticise; but we cannot You never can make this nation one by force. It was possible in 1861, when, as I think, one half of the South was Union and the other half Confederate. The great Crittenden resolution of July, 1861, was based on that idea-that a large body of Southern white men were on our side, and only wanted to be assured that we meant to be conciliatory, and they would show themselves. Possibly it might have been so; but we can never know now, because every month of the war has built up a Confederate sentiment, angered, embittered, confirmed against us. Jefferson Davis made a rebellion; it was all he could make. Abraham Lincoln made a Confederacy; no man but he could have made it. (Hisses.) Well, if it is not true, disprove it! (Applause.) The Crittenden resolution was passed, as I believe, on the sound basis that the South had been hurried, against her will, into rebellion. Fremont’s statesmanlike word echoed over Missouri. (Applause.) Had it been seconded, with that element at the South, and similar enthusiasm
at the North, we might have beaten out the rebellion in six or nine months, and had a South not thoroughly alienated from us. But the men who have lost their sons, their property, their houses, who have seen the loved form of their States beaten to ashes-these men are to-day Confederates from anger who were once Unionists from old association. Three years of war have grouted that which was merely a temporary rebellion into a planted confederacy, and it is the slowness and indifference of the government that have done it. To-day, therefore, the man who takes the helm of the vessel of State in his hand has a tea-fold harder work to do than Abraham Lincoln had in March, 1861, for he has got the South, as far as such a thing can be, unanimous against him. You cannot reconstruct this Union on the loyalty of the white men of the South; there is nothing of it . You may conquer them down to New Orleans; you may cover Virginia with the best blood of the North and of the South both, and when it is over, the South will hate you worse than before. You must reconstruct these States on the loyalty of somebody. How shall it be done? There are but two ways. One is to keep them Territories for twenty years, until this generation dies out; until the temptations of business, until the patronage of the government, until new associations, until the immigration of Northern mercantile interests, shall replace that white population. Then you may do it. But in the meantime, you must keep one half of this country under the form of Territories, and trust the government with despotic power. I tremble for such an experiment. In the hands of such men as some we have seen in the Presidential chair, I should give up all hope of ever again seeing a Republic. The only other way to reconstruct the Union and save Republican institutions, is to reconstruct it on the only loyal basis that exists- the blacks. (Applause.) If there are not 10,000 white men in New Orleans who will vote for us, as there are not, (Gen. Banks had to press his own soldiers up to the ballot-box to make out that number,) then take the 400.000 blacks-give them a vote-link them to the fortunes of the Union-acknowledge the manhood of the black man till the white man is converted. (Applause.)
But I have spoken a great deal longer than I have any right. Whatever I have to say further, I will add at some future session. 
The PRESIDENT. Perhaps the Chair will be pardoned for a single remark, before introducing the next speaker. Our friend Phillips has said, very truly, that the American people have laid down the principle, that once in four years they mean to look their administra-
"Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof."
"I lay this down as the law of nations. I say that military authority takes, for the time, the place of all municipal institutions, and SLAVERY AMONG THE REST; and that, under that state of things, so far from its being true that the States where slavery exists have the exclusive management of the subject, not only the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, but the COMMANDER OF THE ARMY, HAS POWER TO ORDER THE UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION OF THE SLAVES.... From the instant that the slaveholding States become the theatre of a war, CIVIL, servile, or foreign, from that instant the war powers of CONGRESS extend to interferences with the institution of slavery, IN EVERY WAY IN WHICH IT CAN BE INTERFERRED WITH, from a claim of indemnity for slaves taken or destroyed, to the cession of States, burdened with slavery, to a foreign power.... It is a war power. I may it is a war power; and when your country is actually in war, whether it be a war of invasion or a war of insurrection, Congress has power to <illegible> on the war, and MUST CARRY IT ON, ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF WAR; and by the laws of war, an invaded country has all its laws and municipal institutions swept by the board, and MARTIAL POWER TAKES THE PLACE OF THEM. When two hostile armies are set in martial array, the commanders of both armies have power to emancipate all the slaves in the invaded territory."-J.Q. ADAMS.

tion in the face, and see if it is worth while to change it. But they have not committed themselves to the one term principle—they have not been so foolish as that; they say that every four years they will look and see whether they will change their President or not; but they hold to the principle that they may keep him in office for eight, twenty or fifty years, if he and they live long enough, and they like each other well enough (Applause.) So they are coming together this season to look at him; and I can only express the conviction of my own mind, that when they shall come together, and shall look the fact in the face, that no man in this nation is now so hated and detested by the rebels of the South, and by all at the North who sympathize with the rebels, as ABRAHAM LINCOLN, they will make up their minds that he will do to "run the machine" four years, longer. (Enthusiastic applause and cheers.)
A Voice—Butler is more hated. 
The PRESIDENT continued—Grant that there are many sad things to look in the face; grant that the whole of justice has not yet been done to the negro; grant that here and there grievances exist which are to be deplored and to be redressed; still, looking at the question broadly, comprehensively, and philosophically, I think the people will ask another question— whether they themselves have been one hair’s breadth in advance of Abraham Lincoln? (Applause.) Whether they are not conscious that he has not only been fully up with him, but, on the whole, a little beyond them? (Applause.) As the stream cannot rise higher than the fountain, so the President of the United States, amenable to public sentiment, could not, if he wished to do it, far transcend public sentiment in any direction. (Applause.) For my own part, when I remember the trials through which he has passed, and the perils which have surrounded him—perils and trials unknown to any man, in any age of the world, in official station—when I remember how fearfully pro-slavery was the public a sentiment of the North, to say nothing of the South— when I remember what he has had to deal with—when I remember how nearly a majority, even at this hour, is the seditious element of the North, and then remember that Abraham Lincoln has struck the chains from the limbs of more than three millions of slaves (applause); that he has expressed his earnest desire for the total abolition of slavery; that he has implored the Border States to get rid of it; that he has recognized the manhood and citizenship of the colored population of our country; that he has armed upwards of a hundred thousand of them, and recognized them as soldiers under the flag; when I remember that this Administration has recognized the independence of Liberia and Hayti; when I remember that it has struck a death-blow at the foreign slave trade by granting the right of search; when I remember that we have now nearly reached the culmination of our great struggle for the suppression of the rebellion and its cause, I do not feel disposed, for one, to take this occasion, or any occasion, to say anything very harshly against Abraham Lincoln (Loud and prolonged applause.)
Now let me say, that we have been in the habit of calling the Attorney-General of the United States a ”fossil,”," an " old fogie;” but it is a Scriptural command to ”give credit to whom credit is due, and honor to whom honor is due,” even if he be an “old fossil.” Whatever Gov. Andrew may have done—all thanks to him!—I think we are to look at the man who actually did the act, who stands historically as the man who did it. Whatever may have been done by individuals to urge on the government or the Attorney-General to a righteous decision, he has done two things which should make him, and will make him, honorable in the history of the United States. He has dared, in the face of the Supreme Court, with Judge Taney at its head, to declare that every colored man is a citizen of the United States (applause); and he has also declared, that between white soldiers and black soldiers there is, there must be, and there can be, no inequality, but that all must stand on the same level, and receive the same reward. If fossilism can do as well as that, let us be thankful, and let radicalism do better if it can. (Applause.)
I have now the pleasure of introducing one whose citizenship has been recognized by the Attorney-General of the United States, in behalf of the President and the Administration—Prof. WM.H.DAY

SPEECH OF W. HOWARD DAY.
MR. PRESIDENT AND FRIENDS: The time has so far elapsed; that it becomes me to speak but briefly. There seems hardly any need of me here, judging from the speeches of the noble men who have just addressed you. Their statement of the wrongs to the colored race has been so full, that the blackest man among us could not state it better. I appreciate all which the first speaker (Mr. Phillips) said so well. I enter fully into the criticisms—the severe criticisms—so needed and so just—of the state of things to-day; and for my interest in the people with whom I am identified, I would not lessen the force of those words, for I feel their truth. But I appreciate also the position of your President (Mr. Garrison,) who has just addressed you, and feel with him that much of the failure of Mr. Lincoln to do duty it owing to the failure of the people of the land whose agent he is. Do we complain that Mr. Lincoln and the government do not recognize the manhood of the negro? Let us find the cause of that in the people at home. Just so long as citizens of New York exclude respectable colored persons from railway cars on the streets; just so long as the people of the city exclude the colored children from the ward schools, and force the colored children from several wards together, on the ground of color merely; just so long as even in some of the churches of the city there are negro -pews—just so long as there is evidence that the people themselves do not recognize the manhood of the black man of this country.
Though the nation has been cast into the crucible of War, with waves of Death sweeping, for three years past, through oar very hearts, the nation has yet to learn one of the first truths proclaimed by this organization—namely, that everywhere and at any time emancipation in little or large numbers is a safe policy. And I deem it fitting upon the Thirty-first Anniversary of the American Anti-Slavery Society to note the fact that to-day we have a perfect vindication of your principles, if not of all your policy—to point to the realization of the great truth of the safety of emancipation, vindicated, without exception, in every case of thorough emancipation around the world. In 1794, in St. Domingo, Cayenne, Gaudaloupe and Martinique; in 1810, in Canada; in 1811, in Java; in 1815, in Ceylon; in 1816, in Buenos Ayres; in 1819, in St. Helena; in 1821, in Colombia and Chili; in 1828, in Cape Colony; in 1825, in Malacca; in 1826, in Bolivia and the Southern Provinces of Burmah; in 1828, in Peru, Guatemala and Monte Video; in 1834, in the British Isles in the Caribbean Sea; and since, in British India and other places too numerous to mention. It may not be known to you, that even in Canada, now so free, African slavery existed, and from 1803 to 1810, the poor slave groaned—groaned there as be has since groaned here. They then ran to the United States for protection in freedom, as since, to the number of fifty thousand, the United States slaves have run to Canada. There they toiled and pined—unheeded by even the Governors of the land, until a Governor came from England who understood England's principles. He appealed to the Chief Justice of Montreal to declare the law—and that Chief Justice, going back to 1772, declared slavery to be so incompatible with British law, that immediately every slave in Canada must go free. Those thousands thus introduced to manhood, united with the fifty thousand escaped slaves of this country, have wrought on, until their claim to manhood has been vindicated. Out of thirty thousand cases examined into, we find that twenty-seven thousand of these new-made freemen have had no aid for their physical wants from any source whatever. A vindication, Mr. President, of themselves and of your principles as well. The principles of equality for, human beings in the church, and before the law of the hand, urged by your Society in the early day, of the land, urged by your Society in the early day were responded to by the cry, "Let the blacks show themselves capable—it is not in them to rise." Here was another vindication from their
<c02>
own hands of their manhood, disputed, denied, and of the truth of your principles.
Another point is, that the United States have been no exception to the rule. Take even Louisiana, where, at Mr. Phillips justly complains, serfdom has been substituted for slavery; and we find even there the manhood of the black man and his fitness for freedom vindicated. Col Hanks, Superintendent of Labor at New Orleans, says: “The Free Labor movement brought ten to twelve thousand refugees at public expense. Subsequently, conquests swelled the number to 20,000. Not an able-bodied man is there who does not support himself. Only two hundred (and these include sixty orphans) who are supported.” It becomes me to be brief, considering that we are all anxious to hear the gentleman who is to follow me— and I omit other facts Colonel Hanks gives as to schools, etc. For the same reason, I omit special reference to the West Indies.
These points which have risen up in the pathway of the nation and have become facts, the American Anti-Slavery Society fully believed, in its inception. They urged them, therefore, with might and main. Charged with infidelity as was this organization, it yet used Christian weapons to urge its work. The burden of all was the negro’s manhood. The first Biblical truths I have remembered—truths burnt more deeply than others into my memory—were words read at these Anniversary Meetings, as read to-day, by the Garrisonian President of this Society, from the Book of Books, the Word of God. He pointed us through them, away back to the thunderings and lightnings of Sinai, where God, with his finger dipped in flame, wrote himself anti slavery saying, “I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: thou shalt have no other gods before me "—to the fact that the 16th verse of the following chapter makes him who said: “Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed, for in the image of God made he man "—also to say: “He that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death"— thus making the right to life and the right to liberty paramount and inalienable. That Jesus proclaimed it when he said: “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." That Peter thundered it forth on the astonished ears of the haughty Jew—" Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons." That Paul attested the love he had for liberty by saying. “I would to God that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.” And that voice has been going around the world, like a wave of fire licking up the despotisms of the world, but yet, through this Society and by other means, continuing to whisper in the ear of the bleeding bondman—" Thou thyself art a man!” This manhood thus vindicated by the friends of the black man and the black man himself, deserves a mention by us to-day. At this Thirty-first anniversary we can point to results as they stand up proudly in the pathway of the nation. Thus the colored people have risen, despite the objection to their color, despite all obstacles by the help of their friends and by self help, by events by war rolling its red waves through half a million hearts and homes, sweeping out the jewels in those hearts and homes, and burying them out of sight, until they shall be taken up to make up His jewels—but at the same time purging the issues of national life and preparing them to be issues for national freedom In accord with the first resolution proposed to-day, reverently recognize the hand of God, and thank Him for his faithfulness to the poor bound slave. Thanks for war even, if it bring liberty. In the colored people’s name, whom, in part, I represent, I thank you, Mr. President, for your earnest and able support in their uplifting. Thanks, that amid obloquy, danger and death, you were unawed. Thanks, that in the Old World and in the New, you would be heard. May. you long live to enjoy the blessings of a country truly free! And when the closing hours of your benevolent eventful life shall have come, they will be surrounded with a halo of glory all the more brilliant, because you labored to release those whom others had bound, and to lift up to the light the poorest man of America.
What shall I say to your coadjutors upon this platform—one of whom has preceded, and the other of whom will follow me? Par nobile fratrum. One in the Old World and the other in the New. Both the polished, unbending defenders of liberty here—both the implacable foes of tyranny everywhere. But for George Thompson, I may add, that India in the West and India in the East—Great Britain in the mists of the North, and this great nation, the child of Great Britain, in the clear sky of the farther South—will, together, weave a chaplet for him while living, and will strew roses upon his grave when dead, because in every land he did what he could, in the homes of the rich and the huts of the poor, to give Liberty back to the world as she came from God, fair and pure as an angel, unmarred by sorrow, untouched by crime, un fettered by chains.
To all the members of this Society—to the men and women—from a full heart, and from a people whose hearts are full, thanks, thanks to all!
But, in conclusion, from this table-land of rest this morning, we see all over the vast plains before us, that there is work to be done. It is well to look backward over the work of thirty-one years, but we must look forward as well. There is work to be done. Slavery is not dead yet, for all the songs we hear chanted over its grave—and your work, sir, and mine, and the work of all of us, is to throttle it where it lives, and give it no quarter until we drive it from the land Your national danger, as has been well intimated, is not rebellion—that can be met and overthrown—but the manner of dealing with the rebellion. Your danger is not slavery merely as against liberty—for slavery would always go under. J. M. Mason, the author of the Fugitive Slave Bill, when visiting, years ago, a house in New Jersey where I slept the other night, admitted that Slavery and Liberty were not equals—but that the thrift of the North was the thrift of Freedom. Slavery must thus always go under. That, therefore, is not your danger, but this—the manner of dealing with slavery.
I have been asked to describe slavery. If I were a painter, I would attempt it. I would erect in the corner there a huge engine, working from daylight to dark, and from dark to daylight, busy, busy, busy, with its iron arms crushing the body and the soul. I would place beyond it the remains of the victims who have already passed through the machine—already has it destroyed its millions—and even now there are hundreds of thousands chained for its murderous purposes. And yet the work goes on! Listen, as its ponderous wheels creak over the bones of innocent men, and women, and children! And there I would dig a pool nearly filled with clotted blood, that its stench might come up continually to remind us of the cruelties of slavery. And there I would make the entrance to a tomb and part prison, leading on and on to the Mexican Gulf. With the living slave I would place the mangled remains, the heart’s beat affections, the unrealized desire, the hope for freedom, the aspiration for a higher existence and manhood. I would raise over it a mound, and I would picture some one like Lovejoy, and Work, and Burr, and Thompson, and Torrey, and John Brown, walking among the graves, rolling away the stone from the door of the prison-sepulchre, and letting in the light of freedom. And there I would show relentless persecution following them: Lovejoy with a rifle, Work and Torrey with a penitentiary sentence, George Thompson and others with mobs, and Wm. Lloyd Garrison with a rope around his, neck, and a prison for his home. I would erect in the centre there a heartless, hellish image, with a giant’s strength, a scorpion's sting, and a hyena's heart, to clutch each of us as we entered those doors, and in his lap a huge cup to receive your hard earnings, as the dairy demand of the demon to sustain his system. I would crown him king. I would then close up every window here but one, that the darkness might go on, with only light enough to make it more dismal. I would then go up and down the land, and bring men and women to see it as it is—until its impression
<c03>
should be daguerreotyped upon the soul—until men and women should feel that liberty is above all price, and that slavery must die.
All would unite with us in singing then—
 “Down let the shrine of Moloch sink, 
And leave no traces where it stood; 
Nor longer let its idol drink 
Its daily cup of human blood; 
But rear another altar there,	
To truth, and love, and mercy given— 
And Freedom's gift and Freedom's prayer
Shall call an answer down from Heaven.”
The PRESIDENT—If there is a white man in this assembly who thinks he can make a more eloquent speech than that, let the prodigy stand up, and show himself to our astonished gaze. (Applause.) How true it is that, whatever his complexion may be, "a man's a man for a' that!" for our friend who has just taken his seat has proved himself to be a man, from head to foot We are now about to take up a collection, and while we are doing so, the choir will sing another hymn, and then we shall hear our friend, GEORGE THOMPSON; and while he is speaking, we will “take no note of time, even by its loss.”
The following him then was sung:
GOD made all his creatures free; 
Life itself is liberty; 
God ordained no other bands
Than united, hearts and bands.
Sin the primal charter broke— 
Sin, itself earth's heaviest yoke; 
Tyranny with sin began, 
Man o'er brute, and man o'er man.
But a better day shall be, 
Life again be liberty,
And the wide world's only bands 
Love-knit hearts and love-linked hands.
The PRESIDENT—Now, friends, a single word; for after the splendid yet just eulogium passed upon the friend at my side by Mr. Day, nothing else is really needed. But, in a word: in 1833, when I was in England, and heard GEORGE THOMPSON advocate the cause of the slaves of the West Indies, and saw that their emancipation was nearly consummated at that time, believing that, if he could come over to our country, he could win a yet more glorious victory in emancipating slaves on a still larger scale, I invited him, on my own responsibility, to come. I had nothing to offer him; no reward, no compensation, no chance of having any fair treatment; but to come and look peril in the face, to come and be scoffed at and hounded down wherever he might travel— nothing else. And for his love of humanity and liberty and our country, he came; and he came to experience more than I ever conceived in regard to the satanic persecution which followed him in every direction. He took his life in his hand, and it was by a miracle he escaped at last; his very friends had to force him out of the country to save his life. He came again, to find public sentiment somewhat altered, but still very bitter and malevolent against him; and now he has come a third time. O, what a change is indicated by his coming! (Applause.) How cheering and how glorious! These are bright days, not dark ones; they are full of hope and of glory; for whereas, in Boston and in Massachusetts he was for merly hunted for his life, on his coming this time, Massachusetts and Boston make the amende honorable, in the person of Gov. Andrew, in Music Hall, welcoming GEORGE THOMPSON as the friend of America and of liberty throughout the world. (Loud applause.) In this city he was received with the strongest demonstrations of regard, Gen. Fremont doing himself great honor in presiding on the occasion. (Applause.) Then Mr. Thompson proceeded to Philadelphia, and then to Washington, where the President of the United States, the Vice-President, and the most distinguished -members of both Houses of Congress, united in giving him a cordial, honorable welcome, recognizing his labors in the past, and claiming him to be the friend of America and free institutions. I now introduce GEORGE THOMPSON.

SPEECH OF GEORGE THOMPSON. 
Mr. Thompson, on rising, was greeted with the most cordial and hearty applause, and was evidently laboring under strong emotion when he began to speak. He said:
MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMAN: It is extremely embarrassing for me to attempt to speak under circumstances like the present There have been times in the past when my humble labors, in the midst of contumely and persecution, may have been of some slight service to the great cause; but I come to you now under such different circumstances, and find myself so continually made the subject of eulogistic remark, that I scarcely ever rise to speak when I have not first to overcome the embarrassment which is caused by the necessity laid upon me of listening to commendations of my poor services which I feel that I cannot appropriate.
I well remember the time to which Mr. Garrison alludes. It is about thirty-one years ago since he, an American, and I, an Englishman, shook hands upon the pavement of a street in London. I dare say he has not forgotten that day. I can never forget it, for it decided the current of my future life. Had we not met there then, we should never have met to-day here. It was that meeting that brought me to your shores; and now that I stand once more upon the platform of the American Anti-Slavery Society, I cannot say that I feel myself a stranger. This Society was talked of with me, and frequently, before it was brought into existence. When it was formed, at that ever memorable gathering in the city of Philadelphia, and when its Declaration of Sentiments was adopted. and published, I took that Declaration of Sentiments, and carried it through the length and breadth of my native country, and I made the names of the illustrious men and women who adopted or subscribed that document familiar as household words in the homes of England; and when I came to this country, and before I hat been a week in it, in a place very near to this, and in a small back room, where sat the now venerable and venerated Arthur Tappan, and the gentleman who sits at my side (Mr. Rankin)—whom I recognize with unmistakable pleasure to-day; for his house was the first into which I was received in this country, (applause)—there in that small room, at the hands of Mr. Arthur Tappan, and subscribed by the officers of the Society—Mr. Rankin at that time being one—I received my credentials as an agent of the Anti- Slavery Society. As its agent, and performing the duties of a devoted and most obedient agent, I remained in this country until that time came which has been referred to by Mr. Garrison, when, not from any shrinking on my part, but too much love on the part of my friends, I left their country for my own. I call the members of this Society to witness, that wherever I have been, I have stood by the Society unswervingly, upholding its principles and doing justice to its fidelity under all circumstances. (Applause.) The principles of that Society were mine before it came into existence; I had carried those principles through Great Britain, and their triumph was drawing near when that meeting took place between me and my friend to which both he and I have made reference. By those principles you have stood, unchanging and true, to the present hour. For this you are honored. The men and the women of this Society, who were with it in its earliest existence, and have remained with it until this hour, are honored in England as no other men and women are honored among us, (applause;) and if you want to evoke the shouts and plaudits of an English assembly, utter not the names that stand highest among you in literature, in art, in politics, or in wealth—no, but speak the name of some humble man or humble woman, who, taking his or her life in their hands, has gone forth, and for thirty years proclaimed in the ears of this nation the great principle on which this association stands to-day—slavery is a crime in the sight of God, and ought therefore to be immediately, utterly, and universally abolished I! (Applause.)
I come again, and what do I see? When I left you. slavery appeared so enthroned, so ubiquitous, so omnipotent in your land, that it seemed as though nothing could shake it In Church and State, in politics and religion, In the exchange, in the school room and
<c04>
in the college, everywhere, slavery was predominant, slavery was absolute. I come again, and find all changed. You were one; you are two. You were a congeries of commonwealths, but one confederate Republic; you are now divided into the United State and the Confederate States; you have two Presidents, two Constitutions, two Congresses, two armies. All is divided. What has done this? Slavery—simply and solely, slavery! And it was necessary and natural that it should be so. Mr. Phillips, by the use of one of those striking images which no man knows so well how to use as himself, has shown yon that you attempted, in the beginning, to reconcile things which were in their nature wholly irreconcilable, antagonistic, always and ever at war. You were trying to unite good with evil; light with darkness; truth with falsehood; Christ with Belial; the divine spirit of freedom with the infernal spirit of slavery. You tried to do this. You were shown repeatedly that the thing was impossible; still you tried again. You conceded, you compromised, you consented, you supported, you were accomplices, you were abettors, you would learn no lesson; and so at last the system that you thought to uphold and to perpetuate has been smitten—smitten as with the lightnings of heaven—and you must build again—how, my honored friend, and the most gifted champion of the negro, has shown you this morning. God grant that his advice may be taken! (Applause.) No more compromise; no more acknowledgment of the right of property in man; no more degradation of an immortal, rational creature of God down to the condition of four-footed beasts—a chattel personal. No; be it done sooner or later—be it done by Mr. Lincoln or by his successor—it must be done. You must finish the work you have begun. You must “lay righteousness to the line, and judgment to the plummet,” and you must present the negro of America to the eyes of man and of angels like yourselves —a man; nothing better, and nothing worse. (Loud applause.)
I thank Mr. Phillips for his speech this morning. I am not going to refer to his criticisms, to say how far they are necessary or justified; but I thank him for; this, that throughout his speech, it was not that he opposed Mr. Lincoln or his Administration so much as that he loved the negro and the cause of justice above everything, and would save the cause of the negro from peril and disaster. (Applause.) But we in England are wont to deal with public men somewhat—I will not say more justly, for that would be to impugn the justice of the criticisms of Mr. Lincoln—but permit me to say we judge them more leniently. I, through thirty-five years of incessant agitation, have learned this lesson, that men in office cannot always do what they would. (Applause.) Now, do not imagine that I am going to make a Presidential speech, to nominate a candidate, to counsel you as to the course you should pursue, or to act the presumptuous part of an adviser in respect to your nominations in the pending election campaign. Far from it. Such matters belong to you, and not to me. My prayer is that you may choose the right man; a man as much better than Mr. Lincoln as a man may be; but I pray Heaven he may not be a worse. (Applause.) But you will perhaps allow me to say that we have been taught in England to judge somewhat leniently of men after they get into office. Some few friends of mine, during the last three years, have gone into the Cabinet, become part and parcel of the Administration. I do not think them worse men than they were before; I do not think they have abandoned their principles. I think they love the old cause to which they were formerly devoted, but I know they have been much hampered and fettered by going into office. I know that, from the moment they entered office, felt its responsibilities, and found they had to administer the government for the entire country, to consult the wishes, opinions and views of all men, to balance the strength and influence of one party over against the strength and influence of another, to do justice to their opponents as well as to their friends, to work with the elements that they had, and not with the elements that they had not, that they had clashing interests to reconcile, and conflicting counsels to listen to, they learned that while it was very easy, upon the opposition bench, to arraign the incumbent Prime Minister, and those in possession of power, and exceedingly pleasant to deliver eloquent denunciations upon abstract principles, and demand great, sweeping and uncompromising reforms, it was another and very different thing to discharge their duties honestly and efficiently, and at the same time advance in some humble degree the cause to which they had been devoted when out of office. (Loud applause.)
I will take, by way of illustration, the case of a man who comes nearer to an American in his idea of the beau ideal of political institutions than any Englishman I know, save one—I mean John Bright. (Loud applause.) John Bright goes for “God and Democracy.” John Bright is not afraid of rebellion, as some people are, whom the very name frights from their propriety. He is not afraid of it He traces most of the good things we enjoy in England from rebellion. He has looked into the history of your rebellion, and I believe that, like myself, he has exulted in the good that has already resulted to this mighty nation from that rebellion. John Bright is the friend of the working classes of England. He desires to see them enfranchised, and he has from time to time prepared bills, with a view to obtaining acts in Parliament that should enfranchise the enfranchised masses of the people; and I well remember that upon one occasion, when he had prepared such a bill and resolved to bring it into Parliament, a consultation was held with the members of the Administration and other friends, and being informed by the Administration that they intended to bring forward such a measure, the leading features of which they stated at the meeting, and that, if he brought his in there would be a collision between the one measure and the other, and probably the loss of both; although the measure of the government did not, by any means go so far as his own, did not meet the whole justice of the case, nor satisfy the demands which the radical party had made, Mr. Bright consented to sacrifice his popularity with his radical friends outside and go with -the government, in the hope that, if he could not obtain all he desired, he might at least obtain a measure of justice, and then make the admission of that measure of justice the vantage ground from which to proceed to obtain the whole. (Applause.)
I merely throw this out as a hint I may tell you, however, how matters look to us on the other side of the water. We judge of the progress of this country by the great points that come out from time to time. Four year ago, as I have said; slavery was omnipotent. It controlled both your domestic and foreign policy; it appointed your ambassadors; it delegated your judges to the bench; in fact, it ruled the country. We look now, and see an altered state of things. We look over Europe, and see that whereas every one of your employees at foreign courts was formerly a friend and advocate of slavery, every one, be he your respected minister to the Court of St. James, your minister to the Court of Paris, or Vienna, or Berlin, or St. Petersburg, or your consul at Liverpool or at London, is now the friend and champion of liberty. (Applause.) Seeing this, the people of England say, “Things are mightily changed in the United States,” and they look upon the man who made those appointments, or the man and Senate together who made them, as men who, unlike their predecessors, are now administering the affairs of your country in the spirit of equal and impartial liberty.
At the beginning of this war, knowing little of the people of this country, and still less of the structure of your government, the nature of your Constitution, the limited powers of your Executive, and the rights of your individual States, they expected that Mr. Lincoln, who had sent these men abroad—men who appeared to be so good and so true—being in the Presidential chair, and armed not only with the constitutional powers enjoyed and exercised by every President, but possessing all the powers vested in him, in the last resort, as Commander-in-Chief—they expected, I say, that he would at once abolish slavery. He did not do it. They thought him bound to do it; he did not do it Contrariwise, they did not like his speech from the steps of
<c05>
the Capitol. They thought it was ten words for the, South to one for the North; that there was, too much coaxing, promising, cajoling, too much of the spirit of concession; and above all. they, thought it strange that the representative of the Republican party should even promise that the Fugitive Slave law, if necessary, should be made more stringent than it was.
Well, they looked again, and there came a voice from America—the official, diplomatic despatches of Mr. Seward; and they said: “You must not talk against slavery; you must not encourage the idea that slavery will be abolished; you must not tolerate the mention of slavery in your conversation with the ministers of foreign powers; you must declare that this war will not change the states of a single negro; that It will be over in sixty or ninety days;" and they did not like that. Then they did not like to see your news-papers—even Republican newspaper—stigmatizing the Abolitionist as marplots, and declaring that they were disturbing the counsels at Washington, that they were injuring the influence of Mr. Lincoln, that they were preventing men from joining the army, because they were representing that the abolition of slavery was one of the objects of the war. I tell you, even your Republican press did much to repress the sympathy of the English people by their abuse of the Abolitionists. Then there were constant instances of the rendition of fugitive slaves, by the soldiers and officers of the United States; and then the modification of Gen. Fremont’s proclamation in Missouri, the treatment of Gen. Hunter, Gen. Phelps, and others, the “iron hand" ordinance of Gen. McClellan in Western Virginia—these things startled the anti-slavery people of England. Their sympathies were ready to gush forth, but they could not find vent, white as yet it seemed, not only that you were not going to abolish slavery through this was, but that you were ready at any time to fling over the black man if you could secure the restoration of the Union and the re-establishment of the supremacy of the Constitution.
Shall I tell you when it was that the reaction in your, favor took place? It commenced with the message of your President of the 7th of March, 1862, when he recommended the passage, by Congress of a resolution promising indemnity to the planters of the slave States if, in their State Legislatures, they would take means to abolish slavery. And then you know what a constellation of measures gathered around that first measure. The abolition of slavery in the District; then the salvation of those great North-western territories from the pollution and curse of slavery; and then the recognition of Hayti and Liberia, so that either of these black Republics, their nationality now recognized by the government, might send their swarthiest representative to Washington, and might enter the presence of the President on the occasion of a levee, and stand on a footing of perfect equality with the palest and the proudest representatives of the oldest monarchies of Europe. (Applause.) Then came other measures, countermanding the order that fugitive slave should be delivered up; the Confiscation law; the preliminary proclamation of September, 1862’; and when that past, and weeks went by, and the hundred days of grace had nearly passed, without the South availing herself of the proffered amnesty—as every well-informed man in England knew she would not—we did not wait for the mail to bring us the news that President Lincoln had confirmed that proclamation. No, we held watch meetings over the length and breadth of England—one great meeting was held in Free Trade Hall, in Manchester, and another in Sheffield—and kept up the discussion on American affairs until 12 o’clock, and then thanked God that there were three million less slaves in the United States than there had been on the 31st of December, 1862. (Loud applause.)
Now the message that I have from England to you, I can deliver in one word. They ask you to carry on this good work to completion. They ask you to do all that Mr. Phillips has said should be done; to give to the negro in the United States the rights that he now possesses in the West Indies, where he is not only free from oppressive chains, but where he can become a freeholder and a voter, claim and obtain a seat in the representative assembly, become Secretary of the Governor of Jamaica, Mayor of Kingston, and be knighted by the Queen. And I am not now quoting things that may be, but things that have been, as your President well knows. They ask you to put the negro in this position. It is for you as Americans to judge through what man or Administration it shall be done; but this I say—and I say it with some knowledge of the state of things in my own country—that for what he has already accomplished and made sure, Mr. Lincoln has won for himself universal gratitude and universal praise; and there is not a name to conjure with so powerful in England as the name of Abraham Lincoln. (Enthusiastic applause.) I thank God for men like him, to rid your hind of this curse and scandal. I thank God for men like Wendell Phillips, (loud applause,) who will stand upon this platform, and say what he has said this morning. That Republic will never fail that has a man like Wendell Phillips, and many more to follow his advice, so that the time may come when slavery shall cease, the proscription of the black man shall cease, the debt shall be paid, the tears shall be wiped away, and America, from North to South, from East to West, shall be hallowed ground, with neither a tyrant wielding a cart-whip nor a negro wearing a chain. (Prolonged applause.)

SPEECH OF LUCRETIA MOTT.
I shall detain the meeting but a few moments. I only wish to express the great interest I have taken in the several speeches that have been made, and to say that I wanted one word should be added, before the meeting closed, in behalf of the warfare which has been carried on by this Society from this platform, and which has resulted, as I believe, in the great change of public sentiment which has been alluded to. The evils of this war were very forcibly presented in the early hour of this meeting, but, as was well expressed, they are inevitable, because we know that war, being of evil, must produce evil, and that continually; still, I would say, I had hoped that better things would accompany our salvation, and the salvation of the country, so that another generation, following this, might be born into a Republic far transcending the Republic that grew out of the Revolutionary war; because the war is now carried on by a people differing very much from the people of that time; an intelligent, instructed people, who have had the advantages of a Republic so far; and when peace shall be restored, they will be prepared to come forward and act unitedly to remove the many evils and wrongs that remain, and the mighty debt which has accumulated in the nation. And then the war has not been a warfare of brute force merely, and the materials that will be brought in with which to build up the Republic will be very different from the materials that were at command after the first war of our country. We shall have a free, liberated people, rather than an agreement that a large portion shall still be held as slaves; there will not be, there fore, that great drawback to our nation's prosperity. Let us, then, hope that in spite of the evils of this war, there is a day approaching when the Republic will be better understood, and the principles of a truly Christian Democracy better carried out, than ever before. So help us God!
Then, again, in the warfare, as it has been carried on, the Administration has been not only at Washington. It has been acknowledged here that woman has had something to do with it; that woman has been cooperating in the warfare which has been going on. I am desirous that our Anti Slavery Society, in its annual meetings, and in all its meetings, should keep the standard of liberty and truth high as in the beginning; and if in thus holding it up, it shall become the duty of men like Wendell Phillips to present the errors and short-comings of the Administration, let them do it; and let us rejoice that we, as a Society, are not part and parcel of the Government, the Administration, or the Cabinet, not even as John Bright was; that we are not responsible; that we have not any load upon our shoulders that shall tend in say way to make us compromise. Let us be careful how we commit ourselves, as a body, as a Society, to one candidate or another.
<c06>
We are in danger of becoming partisans in our feelings, by holding up one man or crying down another, any further than their acts warrant us in doing so. I wish we could hold up Fremont a little more for the act he did, (applause,) but I am glad to hear Abraham Lincoln held up, as we have just now, for the many things that he has done; and where he has fallen short, it is our duty to rebuke him. It is our duty to ourselves to keep the standard high, and to bring the acts of all classes, even of Kings and Governors, to the test of that standard.
I only rose with the desire to express this, and to hold out the hope that we are coming to a great and glorious day, when, I believe, whatever belongs to the great moral warfare of the nation will be commended, not to us, a handful of abolitionists merely, but to the great heart of the people. A proof of this is seen in the willingness, on the part of the people, to sign petitions and send them forth, and to join in the battle armed in the full armor of God; not depending on carnal weapons—knowing, however, that these things must needs be, in a government based, as ours is, and as all nations are, upon the sword—not depending on horses and chariots, but depending on the Lord God; and, going or forth with these weapons, we know they will be effective. Let our faith be firms, then, that they will ever be effective; we can never anticipate fearful, deplorable results from such a warfare, because it has its origin in God, in goodness, in love, in plainness of speech, in justice and mercy and truth.
I never had anything more to confirm my faith is the infinite and the eternal than the success of our weapons of warfare, wielded as they have been, morally, in season and out of season, full of fight as we have been, using the severest language that our dictionary could furnish us with, or that our thoughts could bring forth, to describe the monster slavery. I remember that Wm. Lloyd Garrison, in his first work, almost—“Thoughts on Colonization”–remarked that when Wilberforce spoke against the African slave trade, how vituperative his language was considered; “but now,” said he, "when the scorn of the whole civilized world is brought against this iniquitous system, how mild and inefficient his speeches do appear." So with us; we were afraid to use the “word "menstealers” in the beginning; we had been accustomed to speak soft words; but we found that the necessity was laid upon us, from the fact that we had to speak of slavery as it was; to hold it up to the utter execration of mankind, and to enlist the pulpit and the press in behalf of the suffering and the dumb. I say it is this great moral warfare that has been carried on, that has produced this wonderful change which we are now rejoicing in; and I only desire that we may be just as true as Wendell Phillips has been to-day, not praising men unduly because they have done something, but demanding that they should do the whole. And do not let us be so distrustful of human nature, of the good heart in man, at to suppose that if men have done wrong, they have done as nearly right as they could. Why, human nature judges what is right. Let us have confidence in the human heart. Even the Herald came out in defence of Fremont's proclamation, and the people were ready to say Amen! But we are too much accustomed yet, as our friend said they are in England, to honor people in office. We know them—we know how loyal they are; but we, the people here, we are the administration. Woman is taking her place—here is Susan B. Anthony calling attention to the Women's National League–and the men and women united, the people united, are to become the administration of our country; and then we shall look on these petty servants of ours that are in office, and while we shall give them all the honor they deserve, we shall feel that we must honor most MAN; MAN, wherever he is found; MAN—the black man and the white man; yes, and WOMAN, too. (Applause.)
The choir and audience then united in singing the Doxology, which closed the exercises of the morning:
From all that dwell below the skies,
Let the Creator’s praise arise;
Let the Redeemer’s name be sung
Through every land, by every tongue.
Eternal are Thy mercies Lord;
Eternal truth attends Thy word;
Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore,
Till suns shall rise and set no more.

BUSINESS MEETINGS.
TUESDAY EVENING MAY 10.
The Society assembled for business in the Lecture Room of the Church of the Puritans, and was called to order by THOMAS GARRETT of Delaware, one of the Vice-Presidents.
The attendance of members and friends of the Society from different portions of the country was large.
On motion of SAMUEL MAY, Jr., of Boston, AARON M. POWELL, of New York, was appointed Secretary.
The following committees were also appointed:
Business Committee—Wendell Phillips,. J Miller McKim. Oliver Johnson, Lucretia Mott, Mary Grew.
Finance Committee—E. D. Draper, of Mass, Susan B. Anthony, of N. Y.
Committee on Nominations—Samuel May, Jr., of Mass., Thomas Garrett, of Del., Aaron E. Powell, of N. Y., Rowland Johnson, of N. J., Edward M. Davis, of Pennsylvania.
On motion of OLIVER JOHNSON, a rule was adopted, limiting speakers to ten minutes.
Mr. GARRISON then read the series of resolutions [Nos. 1 to 7] offered at the morning meeting.
PARKER PILLSBURY then offered the following resolutions, upon which no action was taken by the Society:
Resolved, That the mode of reconstruction of the government in Louisiana, under the Amnesty Proclamation, proves that the Administration is willing, if not determined, to sacrifice the interest and the honor of the North, as well as to peril the whole cause of justice and freedom, to secure a sham peace: risking thereby the admission to Congress of a Southern element, able to embarrass if not control its action; and leaving the whole colored population, and the control of the Southern States, in the hands of an unscrupulous, heartless and slavery-loving aristocracy. No do we hear or see any spoken or written protests in the Republican party, or the popular pulpits, of such tone or character as to arrest public attention, and save the country from so dire a calamity.
Resolved, That in view of the momentous interests involved in the reconstruction of the government and Union, we earnestly recommend the support of only such party or candidates as are openly and most unequivocally committed—lst, To the entire abolition of slavery. 2, Such constitutional amendments or enactments as shall forever prohibit its establishment, and secure the equal and inalienable rights of all men before the law, without distinction of complexion or race.
STEPHEN S. FOSTER proposed that resolution No. 1 be so amended as to read, “So that the ‘old covenant with death’ is annulled, and the ‘agreement with hell’ no longer stands.” The amendment was subsequently withdrawn by Mr. FOSTER, but again brought quently withdrawn by Mr. FOSTER, but again brought before the meeting on motion of EDMUND QCINCY, Esq., for discussion. A prolonged and some what desultory discussion then followed upon the present relations of slavery to the Constitution, and the responsibility of the government for its continued existence.
The meeting was successively addressed by Rev. David Root, Jacob L. Paxson of Pa., Wendell Phillips, Edward Gilbert, Esq., Henry C. Wright, George Thompson, Mr. Garrison, and Aaron M. Powell.
Rev. Mr. ROOT considered the country as experiencing the judgment of God. We are a very corrupt people. Our flagrant wickedness and cruel persecution of the colored people must be repented of. He was followed by Mr. PAXON of Pa.
WENDELL PHILLIPS hoped the amendment would not be adopted. So long as slavery was tolerated or the government refused to repeal the Fugitive Slave law, the covenant had not been annulled.
EDWARD GILBERT, Esq., advocated the anti-slavery character of the Constitution. The President deserved

impeachment that he had not summoned to freedom four million of slaves, and by so much reduced the proportions and strength of the rebellion. 
HENRY C. WRIGHT said we assumed at the outset of the anti-slavery movement that we had no constitutional power to interfere with slavery in the States. But now, by virtue of the war power, it might be overthrown, and we, the people, should demand of the President, as our agent, its entire destruction. 
GEORGE THOMPSON said the people of England had regarded our Constitution as usually interpreted by ourselves, affording protection to slavery, but they now held the United States to be absolved from all obligations towards slavery, except to complete its destruction.
Mr. GARRISON argued that the President and Congress were now vested with the necessary power for the entire overthrow of slavery, and they should be called upon by the people to use it. It was a glorious opportunity to rid the country of the pestilence and curse of slavery, and should be promptly improved.
AARON M. POWELL thought it fully within the province of the war power for the President and Congress to entirely abolish slavery in the Border as in the Gulf States, while the war was in progress. It should have been done at the outset. But, until the Constitution be explicitly amended in the interest of liberty, settling the entire question of the legal existence of slavery very anywhere, he regarded our covenant with slavery as only suspended during the continuance of the war. In the slaveholding districts outside the limits of the Proclamation of Jan, 1, 1863, it is not yet annulled. He therefore urged the prohibitory constitutional amendment.
WENDELL PHILLIPS said it was essentially a difference of phraseology, and not as to the doom which should be visited upon slavery, that had prevailed in the discussion.
It was then voted, on motion of Mr. QUINCY, to recommit the resolution to report again to-morrow morning.
The following persons were added to the Business Committee: EDMUND QUINCY, WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, PARKER PILLSBURY.
After a song by JAMES G. CLARK, the meeting adjourned.
WEDNESDAY MORNING, MAY 11.
The Society re-assembled for business at 10 o’clock, A. M.—the PRESIDENT in the chair.
OLIVER JOHNSON read in behalf of the Treasurer the following report:
The Treasurer’s account gives the following figures, showing the financial condition of the Society from May, 1863, to May 1864.
DR.
By Balance from old account $ 4,154 55
By Receipts from donations, subscriptions 
to Standard, and sale of publications 11,334 18
$15,488 73
CR.
To Publishing Standard, for Lecturing 
Agents, and Office expenses 10,649 57 
To Balance to new account 4,839 16 
$15,488 73 
After brief remarks from SAMUEL MAY, Jr., showing that though the financial condition of the Society is more favorable than a year ago, still that liberal pecuniary support is highly important and desirable, the Treasurer’s report was adopted.
Mr. GARRISON, from the Business Committee, reported resolution No. 1, without the amendment proposed by Mr. QUINCY, and instead of the amendment, a supplemental resolution—No. 2 of the series.
STEPHEN S. FOSTER then offered the following resolution: 
WHEREAS, by the insurrection of the Confederate States, all constitutional guarantees of slavery were rendered void, and our old covenant with death was annulled, and our agreement with hell no longer stands; therefore, 
Resolved, That all subsequent support of the institution by the Federal government is a gratuitous service to the cause of despotism and disloyalty, which stamps the present Administration with a deeper infamy than that of any of its predecessors.
Dr. CROWELL believed the war was God’s discipline for a sinful people. Still the nation holds hard to slavery for loyal men. If this Society could frame something for the emergency to be sanctioned by Congress, he would be glad. He admired the moral grandeur of the anti-slavery struggle, and hoped there would be vigilance unto the end. Escaped slaves were still returned to pretended loyalists, and such men clung with a severer grasp than hitherto to their victims. The end must come. It is God’s cause. 
Dr. TOWNSEND dissented from Mr. FOSTER’S resolution—the last clause. It was untruthful to affirm that the present Administration was more infamous than any which had preceded it. He thought Mr. PHILLIPS’S charge upon the Administration, of indifference or unfriendliness to the negro, too unqualified. He instanced the establishment of asylums, schools and churches. Mr. Lincoln, as President, had been more lenient than he would have been. Retaliation was difficult. It was for those who criticise to suggest a method to adopt. What should that method be? He had not been a little dissatisfied and impatient  with President Lincoln, but, on the whole, he regarded him most favorably now.
HENRY C. WRIGHT thought the terms of government and administration were too often confounded. He held the people primarily responsible as the source of government, while the Administration, the officers elected, were responsible as agents and servants of the people. Progress has been made in the right direction. Let the government be freely criticised, but let the responsibility rest in the right place, which is primarily upon the people. Mr. Lincoln commenced his official duties under great disabilities, and, taking all the momentous circumstances into account, he had done well. The contrast with Buchanan’s imbecility and treachery was great. Thousands of slaves had been proclaimed free, and the validity of the proclamation would be maintained. The people themselves were <illegible> Supreme Court.
PARKER PILLSBURY spoke of the anti-slavery enterprise as a sublime moral struggle. Therein was its power. Numerically it had always been weak. It had been a mighty power in the land because of its moral position. He had early left the church and the ministry because he found there so little devotion to truth and justice. Attracted by the moral earnestness and fidelity of this Society, he had brought to it his best offering, and in conjunction with it had labored as best he could to promote the welfare of God’s holy, imperiled cause of justice and liberty. We had been told to stand by the Administration. The Administration does not stand by the slave. When it does, God being my judge, I will stand by it—not till then. He did not believe the President had gone as <illegible> and as fast as the people would have sustained. He referred to the modification Fremont’s and Hunter’s proclamations. When they were silenced, “Copperheads” were born. He had never voted for a President, but rejoiced in the prospect of a political platforms whereon, without compromise, a man could stand. This Society should look well to its ways, that it he not led into the service of an Administration careless of the freedom and justice for oppressed. <illegible> efficiency is in its moral earnestness and integrity.
A GENTLEMAN in the audience, while he admired the fidelity of Abolitionists in moral agitation, thought they should have done their whole duty by going to the polls.
WILLIAM A. JACKSON (Jefferson Davis’s <illegible> addressed the meeting briefly. He rejoiced that so much had been accomplished for the enslaved. He awarded much praise to President Lincoln, and thought he would make a very good President for another four years. His own electioneering arrangements for the coming campaign were already made in the State of Maine.
AARON M. POWELL then offered the following (No. <illegible> of the series.) 
<c02>
He did not regard it as within the province of this Society to support, as a Society, any political party, or nominee for the Presidency, nor could it properly dictate a course of political action to its individual members. It was often brought as an objection against Abolitionists, that they had not gone to the polls with their testimony against slavery. He was willing to risk the verdict of history in their behalf, as an independent moral power in the nation. The moral value of the anti-slavery movement cannot be over estimated, and its responsibilities have been well met. This crowning feature of our enterprise has still its high value, its sphere of great usefulness, and should be scrupulously cherished by as. To such as—apart from slavery—have no scruples against voting, and who now incline to use the ballot, we may properly address the exhortation to give their support only to such men and measures as will secure the total abolition of slavery, its prohibition by constitutional amendment, and the recognition, in reconstruction, of the citizenship of colored men, equal with white electors. 
STEPHEN S FOSTER commmented upon the remarks of a previous speaker, who thought that men who did not and would not vote ought to say nothing upon public affairs. He had not voted himself, neither was Mr. Garrison a voter. Ought, therefore, their mouths to be closed! The non-voter was not necessarily deprived of influence and great usefulness in the sphere of politics. He affirmed his belief in the anti-slavery character of the Constitution. But, at any rate, the war power warrants the entire destruction of slavery. He therefore defended the resolution he had offered, declaring the present Administration more infamous than any of its predecessors. It had the full power and opportunity to pronounce the doom of slavery, but had chosen rather to preserve and protect it wherever it assumed the guise of loyalty. Under Mr. Lincoln’s Administration, more fugitives have been returned to slavery than any previous Administration since the government was organized. The fact is indisputable, and yet, strange to say, Mr. Garrison is advocating the reelection of Mr. Lincoln to the Presidency! Under the testimony of Mr. Sumner and others, we are told that slave-hunting is still prosecuted with the sanction and authority of the government. No previous Administration had ever had so favorable an opportunity to distinguish itself in the service of freedom and justice. Yet no Administration had exceeded the present in its fidelity to slavery and slave-hunting. It was more infamous in the proportion that its opportunities for noble action had been greater. 
MR. GARRISON (EDMUND QUINCY, Esq., in the chair) next addressed the meeting. He criticised Mr. Foster’s resolution as absurdly assuming a covenant to be annulled, which he has told us he did not himself believe ever had an existence. Mr. Lincoln’s Administration, characterized as more infamous than any of its predecessors, has done all, and more than all, that the people, as a whole, have asked for. It has abolished slavery in the rebellious States. It has armed and equipped thousands of colored men as soldiers. Apart from the old Abolitionists, there was no general demand for a proclamation of Emancipation, or for the arming of the negroes. Mr. Lincoln was not therefore to be charged with not being up with the people. He had been true to his own convictions as to the extent he might interfere with slavery. He (Mr. Lincoln) did not accept the Constitution as interpreted by Mr. Foster. He had been governed by military necessity as to what he had done, and also what he had omitted to do, for the overthrow of slavery. The difficulties and embarrassments of his situation have been such as no man in that position has ever experienced. He deserves charitable and generous consideration, rather than wholesale, indiscriminate censure. It is for the people to take home to themselves the larger share of responsibility that all is not done which might have been accomplished. These are not days for despondency and discouragement, but rather for hope and good cheer.  What other Administration less “infamous” has ever done so well? Slavery abolished in the District of Columbia, in the rebellious States, the slave trade suppressed, Hayti and Liberia recognized, and thousands of colored men in the Federal uniform as soldiers? Marvellous indeed have been the changes of the last three years, affording substantial ground for encouragement as to the speedy consummation of our work, the entire abolition of slavery.
MR. DINSMORE differed from Mr. Garrison, and spoke in criticism of President Lincoln. 
DEXTER FAIRBANKS was surprised that old Abolitionists should advocate the reelection of Mr. Lincoln. He himself voted for him, but had been disappointed in his Administration. 
J. M. McKIM thought freedom of debate had been again most fully vindicated in this meeting. He was glad it was so. There had been much unqualified condemnation which it should be borne in mind was not true criticism. He proceeded to answer some of the charges which had been urged against Mr. Lincoln by Mr. Phillips and others. A cashier of a bank, in the midst of a suffering and hungered people, though he was kindly disposed, and had in his keeping a large amount of money, would not be permitted or expected to disburse such funds on his own responsibility. Mr. Lincoln had wisely awaited the direction of events, and consulted the average desire of the people, so far as he could ascertain it. While opposed naturally to slaver, as he has told us in his letter to Mr. Hodges, by the limitations of his office he has rightly governed himself by what he has deemed the military necessities of the nation. Mr. McKim mentioned instances, in Maryland and elsewhere, in which the friendly influence of President Lincoln has been most potentially felt in behalf of the cause of freedom. 
WENDELL PHILLIPS was the next speaker. It was not the function of this Society, nor was it his own, to nominate a President.  To my own mind, the slave’s fate is yet an uncertainty. My dear and faithful friend (Mr. Garrison) differs. I would have sooner severed my right hand than taken the responsibility. There are no hundred men in the country whose united voices would be of equal importance in determining the future of the government and country. A million dollars would have been a cheap purchase for the Administration of the Liberator’s article on the Presidency. Mr. Lincoln’s policy is to save the white slaveholder from all the harm possible. His philosophy does not recognize the manhood of the black man. The interests of liberty entrusted to his hands are therefore imperilled. Apart from justice to the negro, a full and impartial recognition of the black element is indispensable to the elevation of the country. To this Mr. Lincoln is constitutionally averse. If with him the negro men have freedom, he may not be admitted to citizenship. It is only freeing the negro, and then clothing him with the dignity and power of citizenship, that united stable government will in future be possible.

JOHN T. SARGENT. 
LUCRETIA MOTT thought there had not been as much attention given to the consideration of our present and future responsibilities of labor as should have been in the course of the discussions. She exhorted all to continued faithfulness and activity in the use of our weapons of moral warfare. 
EDWARD M. DAVIS spoke of the great responsibilities resting upon all in the present crisis. He had hoped much of Mr. Lincoln, but had been disappointed in him. He mentioned instances in Maryland and elsewhere, in which the Administration of Mr. Lincoln had been implicated disgracefully and unwarrantably in shielding slavery from that destruction which, as a matter of justice, and by virtue of the war itself, was its proper doom. Mr. DAVIS mentioned the name of FREMONT as one who would be a more trustworthy standard-bearer of the cause of Liberty and Union. 
MARY GREW said the great thing for us to remember was that our peculiar work is not yet done. Slaves still stand waiting for their message of freedom. We are still to pursue our work of watching in the slave’s place every act of Congress, every act of the Executive, the position of the Church, the relations of society to the sacred cause of liberty. We cannot yet disband our organization, and trust our work to others. We should all lament to descend to a mere party cause and caucus. Our division of sentiment is as to the best method of work. On the main question of fidelity to the slave, we are as one soul. Our being here together is a pledge of the faithful continuance of our labors. 
The following resolutions from the Business Committee were then adopted: 
1. Resolved, That the American Anti-Slavery Society would, on this occasion, reverently recognize the hand of God in the present rebellion as a merited chastisement for our great national sin of chattel slavery; and deems it matter of thankfulness, now that He has laid judgment to the line, and righteousness to the plummet, that the hail is sweeping away the refuge of lies, and the waters are overflowing the hiding-place. 
2. Resolved, That inasmuch as the present rebellion is exclusively and avowedly the uprising of a slaveholding oligarchy in the interests of their demoniacal slave system, and for the utter subversion of all free institutions, therefore the old “covenant with death” is annulled, and the “agreement with hell” no longer stands; and it is now the primary, paramount and CONSTITUTIONAL duty of the government, through Congress and the Executive, to “proclaim liberty throughout all the land, to all the inhabitants thereof.” And to hesitate to strike this decisive blow, whether through blindness or timidity, is not only to prolong the war, but to make a few questionable exceptions of slaveholding loyalty in the Border States the dominant power over the destiny of the republic, and to render the reconstruction of the Union upon the solid basis of democratic equality impracticable and disastrous. 
3. Resolved, That, in the nature of things, Liberty and Slavery must be in perpetual conflict, to the grievous punishment and ultimate overthrow of any government attempting to unite them in a common bond; hence, not only the suppression of the rebellion, but the total abolition of slavery, is essential to the attainment of peace, the unity of the republic, and the preservation of free institutions.  Therefore, 
4. Resolved, That we hail, as the highest wisdom, the purest patriotism, and the truest justice, the measure now before Congress for the immediate and utter extinction of slavery in those portions of the country exempted from the application of the President’s Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863; and that all honor is to be specially accorded to the Women’s Loyal League for the energy and perseverance they have displayed in the circulation of petitions, (which have been numerously signed and presented,) asking Congress to lose no time in the adoption of that righteous measure; the consummation of which will be applauded by all who are truly loyal in the land, and by the friends of freedom throughout the world. 
5. Resolved, That as it has hitherto been held, under the Constitution of the United States, that every State has a right to determine whether human chattelism shall find protection upon its soil, it is essential that that instrument should contain an article, expressly prohibiting slavery in every part of the country, under all circumstances—anything in any State Constitution or State laws to the contrary notwithstanding; and, rejoicing in the recent action of the  U. S. Senate, adopting such an amendment by a vote of 38 to 6, we trust it will be sanctioned with equal unanimity by the House of Representatives; “believing that it will be duly ratified by the several States, and by an overwhelming majority;—thus redeeming our national character from the infamy which slavery has brought upon it, and making our example potent in the overthrow of tyranny in every part of the globe. 
6. Resolved, That the severest accusations ever brought against slavery as a system, and slaveholders as a body, by the Abolitionists, in regard to the former as being “the sum of all villanies,” and to the latter as being sensual, brutal and ferocious towards the victims of their tyranny, have been fully sustained in the progress of the rebellion; the fiend-like atrocities perpetrated upon the colored soldiers at Fort Pillow, Port Hudson, Fort Wagner, and other places, by the rebel forces, being the natural and inevitable effect of making man the property of man—denying to a race their natural and inalienable rights. 
7. Resolved, That while the government may be sorely perplexed to decide what counteracting measures to institute, whereby these horrible excesses shall be stayed, it is nevertheless bound to give the amplest protection to all who are fighting under its flag; and failing to do this, through irresolution or neglect, it will make itself base and contemptible in the eyes of the civilized world. 
8. Resolved, That the late decision of Attorney-General Bates, that no discrimination can be legally made between those who, as officers or soldiers, are enlisted in defence of the country, and therefore that the same compensation is to be meted out without regard to race or complexion, is one for which he will long be held in honorable remembrance, as well as manifestly just and obligatory; and, while it is humiliating to think that the government should have hesitated to act upon this principle from the beginning, it is unspeakably gratifying to know that this root of bitterness is likely to be extracted, and thus at least in some measure atonement for past injustice is to be made to the gallant men who, at great suffering to themselves and their families, have refused to receive an inferior remuneration on account of their complexion. 
After additional brief discussion, participated in by Messrs. McKIM, GARRISON, FOSTER, DAVIS, MAY, JOHNSON, PHILLIPS, POWELL and others, the following resolution, offered by AARON M. POWELL, was adopted by a close vote:— 
9. Resolved, That while this Society, by the term of its organization, has for its object, through public opinion, the moral regeneration of the nation upon the subject of slavery, we are not insensible to the importance of the present political issues, involving the existence or non-existence of slavery; that while, as a Society, it is not within our province to determine for individual members in respect to the support or non-support of the parties and candidates, we do exhort Abolitionists, and admonish our fellow-countrymen generally, who exercise the elective franchise, to support in the pending important canvas only such candidates and measures as will secure the immedi-
<c04>
ate abolition of slavery, with its prohibition by Constitutional amendment, and the equal enfranchisement of the negro. 
Also the following additional resolution, offered by WENDELL PHILLIPS, on Tuesday morning, was then, after a brief discussion, adopted, by a vote of 21 in the affirmative to 18 in the negative:— 
Resolved, That while we do not criticise the wishes of the Administration, still, as Abolitionists, we feel bound to declare that we see no evidence of its purpose to put the freedom of the negro on such a basis as will secure it against every peril.
Mr. FOSTER’S resolution, after some discussion, was laid on the table.
On motion of OLIVER JOHNSON, the meeting then adjourned, sine die.

NEW ENGLAND ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION. 
The Annual New England Anti-Slavery Convention will be held in Boston on THURSDAY and FRIDAY, May 26th and 27th.
The meeting on Thursday will be in the MEIONAON, (basement of the Tremont Temple,) commencing at 10 o’clock, A. M. On Friday, it will be in the TREMONT TEMPLE. Three sessions will be held each day—at 10, A. M., and at a quarter before 3 and a quarter before 8, P. M. In addition to the well-known and long-tried advocates of the Anti-Slavery cause, who for so many years have sustained the interest of this memorable series of Conventions, and made it such a potent agency against the vile and traitorous schemes of Slavery, we expect this year to have with us our faithful and honored friend GEORGE THOMPSON, of England.
Let every State and section of New England be represented. We respectfully invite delegates from other States. And let those, who cannot appear in person, show their remembrance and their love for the cause by transmitting some contribution in its behalf. 
By order of the Board of Managers of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, 
EDMUND QUINCY, President.
ROBERT F. WALLCUT, 
SAMUEL MAY, Jr., Secretaries.
THE BIBLE AGAINST SLAVERY: or, an Inquiry into the Genius of the Mosaic System, and the Teachings of the Old Testament on the Subject of Human Rights.—United Presbyterian Board of Publication. Pittsburg. 1864.”—pp. 154. Price 25 cts. 
The first thought naturally excited by reading the above title, with no author’s name, was the strangeness of the fact that a Presbyterian Board had advanced so far as to make open proclamation that the Bible is opposed to slavery; the second was to wonder whether this Board, (like the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in 1818, and many subsequent ones,) had contrived to unite the theoretical condemnation with the practical toleration of slavery; and the third was, that a careful examination might be necessary (as in the 1818 document) to separate the wheat from the chaff. 
The last two ideas, however, were immediately dispelled by a glance at the first two lines of the work. It was plain that this treatise was our old friend, familiar through almost our whole experience of the Anti-Slavery struggle, written by Theodore D. Weld, and originally published in the Quarterly Anti-Slavery Magazine for April, 1837, under the title—”Is Slavery from Above or from Beneath?” Copies of two previous editions of it, worn by much lending, now lie before us. One of them we lent, shortly after its publication, to an eminently pious and (church-) case-hardened Northern-born slaveholder from Baton Rouge. He afterwards returned to the North, but keeps his Southern faith, and has always considered Anti-Slavery to be synonymous with Infidelity. In other cases, where the loan of the book fell on good ground, it took root and brought forth good fruit. 
This little work, written and published in 1837, contains, as far as the Old Testament is concerned, the substance of an argument elaborated by Dr. Cheever twenty-three years after, in a volume called—”The Scriptures on the Guilt of Slavery.” Both are excellent. Both are needed. But the briefer one, now republished, does the work as thoroughly and convincingly as need be. No candid reader can resist the evidence it brings. Its publication now by the Presbyterian Board will introduce it to a new set of readers, and a class who have heretofore been wofully in the dark respecting slavery, led astray by the vicious practice of Southern Presbyterians, and the false doctrine of the whole Presbyterian Church, South and North, Old School and New School. Any advance made by them in regard to condemnation of slavery is plainly due to an impulse from without rather than from within. It is a special effort to avoid being left behind by “the world,” the “unregenerate” mass of the community.
The church could have abolished slavery, (or made very large progress towards abolishing it,) in any one year of the last quarter-century. It did not choose to work in that direction. It did choose to hinder the actual workers therein, and to publish many apologies for slaveholding. A year-and-a half ago the President of the United States, not a church-member, and not pretending any impulse but that of military necessity, abolished slavery over three-quarters of the country. Since that time, our armies, not very devout or exemplary bodies, have been gradually grinding the remainder of the system to powder. Now that the peculiar institution seems thoroughly doomed to destruction, publishing Boards and Tract Societies are hurrying in the record of their testimony against it. After its burial has been thoroughly accomplished, no doubt the Prudential Committee of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions will add their voice to the general chorus, and say “Amen, Hallelujah!” in a tone intended to convey the impression that they never held the opposite position.—C. K. W.

YEARLY MEETING OF PROGRESSIVE FRIENDS.
The Twelfth Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Progressive Friends will be held at LONGWOOD, (near Hamorton,) Chester County, Pa., beginning at 10 o’clock, A. M., on Fifth-day, the 2d of 6th month, and continuing, probably, for three days. 
This Society demands assent to no system of doctrines, acknowledges no priesthood, prescribes no form of worship; but, cherishing the utmost liberty of religious opinion, inquiry and speculation, seeks its bond of Union in a common love of God as the Universal Father, a common regard for mankind as one Brotherhood, common aspirations for moral and religions excellence, and common labors to redeem the world from ignorance, superstition and sin, and introduce the era of universal righteousness and peace. Welcoming and cherishing whatever of truth was spoken or recorded in the past, it nevertheless looks continually for fresh revelations of the Divine will, and rejoices in the assurance that it is the privilege of the pure in heart, not less now than in former ages, to hold communion with God, and to be guided by the teachings of his Holy Spirit. The time of its public assemblies is devoted, not to sectarian propagandism, nor to unprofitable strife and debate in regard to modes of faith and worship, but to the discovery and adoption of the measures best adapted to promote the welfare of the human family; to the application of the principles of justice and freedom to individuals, communities and nations; to the promulgation of testimonies against every system of oppression and wrong; to the cultivation of those sentiments, aspirations, yearnings and hopes which proclaim the soul of man immortal as his Maker; and to that exalted fellowship one with another which is the fruit of mutual toils and sacrifices in the cause of our common humanity. 
All who feel attracted towards a Religious Society founded upon the principles, devoted to the objects, and animated by the spirit above described, are heartily invited to meet with us, and take part in our deliberations.

“AN APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC.” It being a well-known fact that the brave men composing the 54th and 55th Regiments Mass. Vols. have, since they have been in their country’s service, received no pay, and also that hundreds of them have fallen in defence of the American flag, leaving here in our midst their poor, suffering and destitute wives and children, the Colored Ladies of Massachusetts, knowing the urgent necessity there is, just at this time, of doing something for these suffering ones, are preparing to hold a Fair in this city at as early a day as possible, this being, in their judgment, the most practical method of accomplishing their object. Donations, either of goods or money, will be most thankfully received by the President, Madam CARTEAUX BANNISTER, 31 Winter street, and the Treasurer, Rev. Mrs. GRIMES, 28 Grove street. As we have just sent into the field another brave regiment, the 5th Cavalry, and their families are left with us, while their husbands, brothers and fathers have gone to uphold the honor of our flag, there will be a demand for all our friends may assist us in raising.

MASON & HAMLIN’S 
CABINET ORGANS. 
<IMAGE>
Every Church, Sunday School and Private Family 
MAY HAVE 
A GOOD ORGAN 
AT a very moderate cost—$85, $100, $110, $135, $165, $260, and upward, according to number of Stops and style of case. 
They are elegant as pieces of furniture, occupying little space, are not liable to get out of order, and every one is warranted for five years. 
THE CABINET ORGANS, 
introduced about a year since, and manufactured exclusivesively by MASON & HAMLIN, have met with success unprecedented in the history of musical instruments. Supplying a long-felt want, they have been received with the greatest pleasure by the musical profession and the public, and have already been very widely introduced, and the demand for them is still rapidly increasing, and must continue to increase as their merits become known. They are to private houses, Sunday Schools, and smaller churches, all that the larger pipe organs are to large churches, In addition to this, they are admirably adapted to the performance of secular as well as sacred music. 
The Cabinet Organ is essentially different from and a very great improvement upon all instruments of the Melodeon or Harmonium kind. Its superior excellence consists in many important characteristics, among which are: 
1. The more organ-like character of its tones. Indeed, it is asserted with confidence that it has not yet been found possible to produce a better quality of tone from pipes than is attained in these organs. 
2. It has greatly more power and volume of tone in proportion to its cost. 
3. By the employment of a very simple and beautiful invention, its capacity for expression is made vastly greater than has ever before been attained in such instruments. This invention is especially valuable, because scarcely any practice is necessary to render it available. Any ordinary performer can master it in an hour or two. 
4. It admits of great rapidity of execution, adapting it to the performance of a great variety of lively secular music. 
5. No instrument is less liable to get out of order. 
6. It will remain in tune ten times as long as a piano forte. 
It may be reasonably said, that if these instruments have the great and obvious superiority thus claimed for them, they must have received very warm recommendations from professional musicians, who would naturally be most interested in the introduction of such instruments, and who are the best judges of their excellence. Such recommendations already have been given tot hem, to an extent unparalleled. 
Among those who have proffered written testimony to their admirable qualities and great desirability, and that they regard them as unequalled by any other instrument of their class, are such well-known musicians as Lowell Mason, Thomas Hastings, William B. Bradbury, George F. Root, &c.; the most distinguished organists in the country, as Cutler of Trinity Church, N. Y., Morgan of Grace Church, Zundel of Mr. Beecher’s Church, Braun, Wels, Wilcox, Tuckerman, Zerrahn, &c.: such celebrated pianists as Gottsehalk, Wm. Mason, Mill. Sanderson, Strakoech, etc.: in brief, more than two hundred musicians, including a large portion of the most eminent in the country, have testified to this effect. Each Cabinet Organ is securely boxed, so that it can be sent safely to any part of the country.

Poetry.
For the Liberator.
THE BONDMAN.
Close by the sea, on the desolate strand,
Where the gruff wave beat with its heavy hand,
I saw the fugitive bondman stand,
Alone, and sad, and weary.
The brisk winds heedless around him played, 
The clouds sailed over, not one delayed,
The pine on the cliff-top no music made, 
The brook crept softly, as though afraid-
Alone, and sad, and weary.
I could not tell why he stood alone,
By the sulky waves, with their querulous tone;
I could not tell, till I heard him moan
A touching soliloquy.
Anon he appealed to the moody seas,
To the winds, to the clouds, to the brook, to the trees, 
To the winds, to the clouds, to the brook, to the trees,
While I heard, as the dreamer his vision sees,
The wonderful colloquy.
The language he spoke was uncouth and unknown;
But the earnest emotion that breathed in each tone,
And the eloquent flame in his deep eye that shone,
These spoke to me:
And I ne'er shall forget, whate'er age be attained,
How the bondman spoke, while his eye explained,
I ne'er shall forget how my heart was pained,
As I stood by the sea:
"O, I am not free!
No, I am not free!
Not free! 
Life is pleasant, men say.
It is sweet to be free!
And I am not free!
Not free!
Life is precious, men say.
It is sweet to be free!
No, I am not free!
Not free!
Pleasant life! Precious life!
Farewell! I'll be free!"
He leaned from the rock-I was helpless and dumb,
My stifled heart beat like a funeral drum-
But the waves dashed up fiercely, and bade him not come,
And the bondman forbore;
But told of his sorrow with sorrowful word,
Still unmeaning to me, though I plainly heard,
But for that eyeflash-like glancing sword
It wounded me sore:-
"Waves, waves, you are free! you are free! you can flow
Half way round the great world; yet how angry you grow,
How quick you curl your white lips when you know
That all is not yours!-O, then, waves, pity me!
Waves, waves, you are free!
"How you hate the great rocks that keep you at bay!
How quick, if you could, you would drive them away!
How you come up to curse them twice every day!
When half of the world is your own, and you free!
Yes, waves, you are free.
"And, waves, if you always fret and roar,
If you always long and toil for more,
When all is your own but a little of shore,
Tell me, what would you do if you were, like me....
But no! waves are free.
”And I must not hate you, for you do not know,—
O waves, if you knew, you would pity me so!
I will ask of the winds, for I just heard them blow,
Of the clouds, trees and brook...But they are all free!-
Will none pity me?
"Winds, Winds, all around the great world you can roam,
All the land, all the sea, all the sky, for a home; 
Would you like to be chained, far away in the gloom!
I am chained-in the gloom; will you not pity me?
But no! winds are free.
Clouds, Clouds, with the winds and the stars you can fly,
You can play, you can sleep in the beautiful sky;
Will you not pity me? will you always pass by?
You would weep bitter tears if you were like me….
But no! clouds are free!
"Trees, Trees, you can grow everywhere on the land, 
Yet how greedy you stretch your long arms from the strand!
Suppose you were torn, by some strong, cruel hand,
From your dear native soil? Trees, Trees, pity me!
No! no! you are free.
Brook, Brook, little Brook, happy child of the hill,
You can go your own way, you can do your own will;
Say, would you be penned up, and made to be still?
O then pity me, brook! Will you not pity me?
Alas! you are free.
"Mankind have no pity; brutes howl and my track,
And ye have no pity-ye bid me go back!
Not a thing, save my brothers, whose faces are black,
In all the wide world will have pity on me,-
The rest are all free."
He paused-and his deep eye grew dim with despair:
All was silent, so silent! earth, water and air.
Such a wonderful stillness was everywhere
As I ne'er thought could be:
All listening; I thought to have listened in vain,
But once more he spoke, though with evident pain,
And faintly that eye-flash came back again,
Still explaining to me:-
"Free! all of you free! O why am not I?
When I ask to be free, why do you deny?
Somewhere, anywhere on this shore let me lie— 
I'll trouble you not, if I only am free:
You are free-pity me!
I have lost the great gift that the Father gave,
Men say I've no soul, I am only-a slave!
O say, is it wrong to be free in the grave?
O answer me, all! Will you not answer me—
May I not be free?”
He ceased: and I thought that the wrathful sea 
Would annul, in its rage, the firm decree 
Which said to it-"Here shall thy boundary be,
Here shalt thou be stayed."
The clouds muttered hoarse from the hurrying sky, 
The winds cried aloud with a passionate cry,
The pines on the cliff-top made instant reply,
The brook complained as it lingered nigh,
In a shadowy glade.
Earnestly thrilling the answer came
From the waves, from the winds, from each cloud's tongue of flame;
From the trees, from the brook it was ever the same—
(I knew it before,)
"Happy and free did God create
Every man in his first estate.
Freedom to all-" no more could I wait.
I sprang down the shore.
A stooping wave toiled upward to meet, 
And laid the bondman down at my feet,
But motionless, voiceless, and rigid-no beat
Of the life-stroke-no breath!
As I musing stood by the silent dead,
An echo came floating about my head:
"Freedom! Freedom to All!" it said.
"FREEDOM, or DEATH.”

WHAT THE BIRDS SAID.
BY JOHN G. WHITTIER.
The birds, against the April wind,
Flew Northward, singing as they flew;
They sang, "The land we leave behind
Has swords for corn-blades, blood for dew.”
"O wild birds, flying from the South,
What saw and heard ye, gazing down?”
"We saw the mortar's upturned mouth,
The sickened camp, the blazing town.
"Beneath the bivouac's starry lamps,
We saw your march-worn children die
In shrouds of moss, in cypress swamps,
We aw your dead uncoffined lie
<c02>
"We heard the starving prisoner’s sighs;
And saw, from line and trench, your sons
Follow our flight with home-sick eyes
Beyond the battery's smoking guns."
"And heard and saw ye only wrong
And pain," I cried, "O wing-worn flocks?"
"We heard," they sang, "the Freedman's song,
The crash of Slavery's broken looks!
"We saw from new, uprising States
The Treason-nursing mischief spurned,
As, crowding Freedom's ample gates,
The long-estranged and lost returned.
"O'er dusky faces, seamed and old,
And hands horn-hard with unpaid toil,
With hope in every rustling fold,
We saw your star-dropt flag uncoil.
"And, struggling up through sounds accursed,
A grateful murmur clomb the air,
A whisper scarcely heard at first,
It filled the listening heavens with prayer.
"And sweet and far, as from a star,
Replied a voice which shall not cease,
Till, drowning all the noise of war,
It sings the blessed songs of peace!"
So to me, in a doubtful day
Of chill and slowly-greening spring,
Low-stooping from the cloudy grey,
The wild-birds sang, or seemed to sing.
They vanished in the misty air,
The song went with them in their flight;
But, lo! they left the sunset fair,
And in the evening there was light.

Selections.
GEN. GILLMORE ON THE PAY AND USE OF NEGRO TROOPS.
[Correspondence of the Evening Post.] 
HILTON HEAD, (S. C.) April 23, 1864. 
I herewith enclose you an authentic copy of a letter addressed by General Gillmore to the General-in-Chief as long ago as the 14th of December last. The letter is at your disposal, to make whatever use of it you may think fit; though I hope, for the sake both of the man and the cause, that you will give it a place in your columns. You will see, both from this, letter and from his recent report of the doings in Florida, that Gen. Gillmore has, by his acts, sealed his practical approval of the policy of enrolling the bondmen of the South in the Union armies; which, it seems to me, fairly shuts off all just cause for doubting his soundness on the negro question. He not only acquiesces in that policy, but is prompt in using his judgment and in giving his counsel with a view to further it.
"DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, HEADQUARTERS IN THE FIELD, FOLLY ISLAND, S. C., Dec. 14, 1863.
Major-General H. W. Halleck, General-in-Chief U. S. A., Washington, D. C.:
SIR:—I desire to urge upon the attention of Government certain simple measures for bettering the condition of the colored people in this Department, colored soldiers in particular.
The policy of the Government in organizing regiments of colored troops upon this coast, and the value and general efficiency of that class of soldiers, have had a fair trial and successful issue under my own eyes. The wisdom of the course pursued (under my uniform rule to treat the white and the colored soldier alike) has been fully vindicated upon the field of battle and in the trenches. Every vestige of the prejudice and ill feeling which existed between the white and colored troops of this command, during a period of inactivity, has disappeared under the excitement of an active campaign, of which the labors and dangers were shared alike by both classes.
I request attention to the following points:—
First. The colored volunteers in this Department are derived from the States of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, and in forming them into regiments, they should be designated as United. States Colored Regiments with the appropriate numbers. This would materially simplify their organizations and increase their efficiency.
Second. A Board for the examination of candidates for commissions in colored regiments should be appointed in this Department.
Third. The pay of the white soldier and of the colored soldier should be. the same. All distinctions calculated to raise in the mind of the colored man a suspicion that he is regarded as an inferior being should be scrupulously avoided. Every dictate of sound policy suggests this course, even if we. regard the matter as still an experiment of doubtful results, which it is not.
Fourth. The families of colored soldiers should be provided for by allowing them to locate upon and cultivate land in advance of the regular survey and sale thereof!
This is important as a military measure, by making the soldier contented with his lot, in securing to him a home for his family during the war, and for himself when the war is over.
I enclose herewith the duplicate of a letter addressed this day to the Secretary of War, recommending the consolidation, under Colonel Littlefield, (Fourth South Carolina Volunteers,) of fragments of the Third, Fourth and Fifth South Carolina Volunteers. Brigadier-General. R. Saxton, who had commenced the organization of the Fifth South Carolina Volunteers, under his special authority from the War Department to raise five thousand South Carolina volunteers, offers no objection to this plan. There are urgent reasons why it should be carried into immediate effect.
Very respectfully,
Your obedient servant,
Q. A. GILLMORE, 
Major-General Commanding.

THEN AND NOW.
It requires no great stretch of memory to refer to a period when freedom of speech in the State of Louisiana was practically abrogated on the subject of Slavery. The Civil Code of that State was considered sufficiently explicit and declaratory on the subject of human bondage, to place it beyond all dissent or controversy on the part of the doubting or captious. It affirms that" A slave is one who is in the power of a master to whom he belongs. The master may sell him, dispose of his person, his industry and his labor; be can do nothing, possess nothing, nor acquire anything but what must belong to his master. If any one questioned the right to establish a system of absolute authority on the one hand, and absolute subjection on the other, he dared not express the doubt—it was treason to the State. If he wondered how a bondage without limitation and without compensation could accord with the divine precepts of Christianity, he dared not ask his minister to explain, for that minister was in the interest of Slavery. If his observations led him to conclude that, economically considered, it is an evil of great magnitude—that it humiliates the mechanic, the artisan, and the manufacturer—that it converts the energy of a community into indolence, its power into imbecility, and its efficiency into feebleness—he could not give expression to such opinions, for it was not safe. If he thought that the harsher features of the system—the lash, the licentiousness, the compulsory ignorance, and the forcible separation of families— found no justification in humanity, or no sanction in religion, he dared not avow such belief, for its avowal would inevitably have resulted in the tightening of a halter around his neck. Freedom of speech was only guaranteed to those who believed in the divine origin, moral right and political advantage of the peculiar institution, and therefore meant only freedom to express what they believed and desired. But as to any expressions of belief or feeling in regard to Anti-Slavery, Emancipation, and kindred subjects, it was not simply abridged, but effectually gagged. 
Now all this is changed, and the change, more particularly in the city of New Orleans, is not partial and half-way, but antipodal. The constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech means something. Its limitations are no longer circumscribed within a line beyond which there are perils innumerable to life or limb. The tongues of the advocates of Slavery have been loosened, and they now preach deliverance to the captives. Its secret opponents rejoice in their newly-found freedom, and about in thunder tones their testimony against the great oppression. We pick up the New Orleans Delta, or Times, or
<c03>
Era, and we gape with astonishment at the boldness of their utterances and the radical character of their opinions. We can hardly divest ourselves of the impression that we are reading Garrison's Liberator or the Anti-Slavery Standard, and we refer back to the title to be certain that we are light. We read on and we find a torrent of vehemence, a bitterness of sarcasm, and a boldness of denunciation in these recently awakened champions of Emancipation that would do infinite credit to Wendell Phillips. If coals are to be thus brought from Newcastle, your occupation, Mr. Phillips, is gone. You will have to hang your harp on the willows and retire from the service. The New England Presses, which have been so energetic and unceasing in their attacks, can now repose upon their laurels, as we shall hereafter expect our full supply of Anti-Slavery literature from the latitude of New Orleans. The Picayune and the Bee are more reticent, and do not fulminate so unsparingly, but they have dragged the ebony idol from its exalted throne, and it will never be replaced. Let us hope that Congress will aid and confirm them in the good work they have undertaken, by so altering the Constitution as to forever prohibit involuntary servitude within their borders.—Baltimore American.

RICHMOND PRISON EXPERIENCE.
STATEMENT OF ONE OF COLONEL DAHLGREN'S MEN.
Editors Baltimore American:
I give you a brief statement of the sufferings of the raiding prisoners that were under command of Col. Dahlgren and Lieut. Col. Cook. On the raid to Richmond, after riding three days and nights, only stopping long enough to feed our horses, we were ordered to halt, build fires, and make coffee, and feed, and being very tired and hungry, we obeyed the order very readily. It being about nine o'clock in the evening, and very dark, our fires enabled the rebels (that were secreted all about us) to come near enough to even count the number of our force. This they told me after we were captured. They mustered their forces and secreted themselves in the wood within two rods of the road, about a mile and a half in advance of where we camped, near a turn in the road. We were ordered to mount and keep well closed up, which we did, Colonel Dahlgren and Lieutenant Colonel Cook in the advance, and as they made the turn in the road the rebels fired a volley into the column from their double-barrelled shot guns, loaded with buck-shot, killing Colonel Dahlgren, and wounding several others, and killing several horses. Then Lieutenant Colonel Cook ordered the fence to be thrown down to the right, which was done in haste, and we fell back in an open field, where we were captured the next morning. They marched us, seventy-three in all, past where Colonel Dahlgren lay. I passed within ten feet of him. He was stripped of every thread of clothing, his false leg taken off, and his finger cut off to get his ring. He had three balls through him, and was almost covered with mud. This was about 8 o'clock in the morning.
They then marched us to Stevensville, where they gave us some water to drink, but nothing to eat. We marched until about 2 o'clock, when they halted, and gave each of the prisoners about a half-pint of corn meal and about an ounce of bacon. We mixed our meal with water (no salt) and baked it in the ashes. The second day of our march the boys began to give out from exhaustion. I could not walk, and I gave a rebel a new overcoat that I had if he would allow me to ride to Richmond. He took it, and told me to get into the baggage-wagon, which I did, suffering from a severe pain in my side. But they were not content to let me ride there, and they took me out of the wagon and put me straddle of a mule. I did not ride more than half a mile before I fainted, and fell off my mule. They let me lay there in the mud until the wagon came up, when they ordered two negroes to pick me up and pitch me into the wagon, and kill the d-d raider, declaring that we all ought to be shot. The most of our boys stood it very well. We arrived at the prison the second night, about 9 o'clock. Three rebels came in, (one of them having a book,) saying: " All of you that have money or watches, come forward and give them up, and I will take your names, and perhaps, when you are paroled, you may get them again; but those that do not will be searched, and if there is any money or watches found about you, it will be confiscated;" and those that did give up their money were also searched, and everything taken. I gave them twenty-three dollars, and then they took my blanket, haversack and contents, knife, pocket-book, postage-stamps, and, in fact, everything except the clothes I had on my back. I had to lie on the floor, with a brick for a pillow, as many of the other boys did.
Our rations consisted of a corn dodger, about the size of one's hand, and about a half pint of black bean soup, which was not fit for hog feed. This was our rations for one day.
I should have stated that the day we arrived at prison there were twenty-eight that were captured and put in prison in the morning. The whole of us were bucked and gagged, and kept in that position for several hours, until some of us were nearly exhausted. This was done because we were raiders. They said that all ought to be shot, and that they were going to turn us over to the civil authorities, and they would hang every d-d one of us. They kept the raiders separate from the rest of the prisoners, not even allowing them to ask for a chew of tobacco. They kept a guard over us night and day, and on the island no language can describe the sufferings there. Frank Leslie's illustrations are nearer than I can describe—worse, if anything, than he represents. The rations there consisted of a piece of corn-dodger about three inches square twice a day, and once in two or three days a small piece of meat of doubtful origin.
There are men here in this ward who actually ate horse beef, and even dog, and were glad to get it. One man I saw in the prison before I went to the hospital, that had one of the dog's paws that he eat of on the island. He said that he was going to keep it and fetch it to our lines when he came. The prisoners on the island, although nearly exhausted from exposure and starvation, were detailed to carry wood about three-fourths of a mile. Some of them were so weak that they could hardly get around, and would refuse to fetch wood. As a mode of punishment for disobedience of orders they had a wooden horse, the legs about five feet long, made after the style of a carpenter's horse, and the bench of it sharpened almost to an edge, on which they would put the prisoner a straddle, tie his hands behind him, gag him, and fasten a rope to each ankle, and stretched both ways, until it would nearly split a man in two. There they would keep him as long as they thought he could stand it, and then they would loosen him, take him 
down, and kick him to his quarters.
There is one man in this ward that they had in this position for nearly two hours. Every few minutes the rebel sergeant would pass by and ask him if he would fetch wood now; his answer was that he was a prisoner of war, and that he would not work. "Then sit there until you will," was the answer. He being very spunky, they kept him in this position until he was nearly exhausted. He could hardly stand or get to his quarters when they took him down, and told him to get into his quarters. There was a squad that had been detailed to go to the prison, where they were going to be paroled, and one poor fellow that was not in the detail, anxious to get away, stole into the ranks, hoping to get paroled. He being discovered by the officer in command, who, having a club in his hand, struck the poor fellow on the head, fracturing his skull, causing death in a few hours. Another was struck on the cheek, cleaving the flesh all off one side of his face. I saw one man shot, sitting in the window eating his breakfast; the guard shot him through, the glass, hitting him in the head, killing him instantly. It is an almost every day occurrence for the prisoners to be shot at through the window by the guards.
A RAIDER,
Of the Army of the Potomac.
PRACTICAL MISCEGINATION. A son of Gov. Smith, of Virginia, was married on the 16th inst., in Vicksburg, to a colored woman, by the regular army chaplain of the 63d U. S. Infantry.
The effect of Abolition measures, sneers the Copperhead Snob. Not so fast, Mr. Snob! The bridegroom was the son of Gov. Smith, by his slave woman, and therefore neither he nor" Abolition measures" are responsible for his being a Miscegen. It seems be was a natural production of modern sham Democracy with which Black Republicanism and Abolitionism had nothing to do.
PECULIAR. Mr. Epes Sargeant's novel by this title, which has met with such a large sale in this country and England, has been dramatized, and will be brought out at the Howard Athenaeum. The narrative of the book is full of dramatic interest, and in the bands of a skilful playwright, will furnish the groundwork for a successful drama.—Boston Transcript.

A REMINISCENCE OF HON. OWEN LOVEJOY.
In the summer of 1850, a fugitive slave, on his way to the land of freedom, came to Princeton, Ill., and finding employment among the farmers, concluded to stop and earn a little money before completing his journey. He remained until haying time, when his master came in pursuit of him; and, having obtained the assistance of a tavern-keeper residing in the place, came upon him suddenly one morning, while quietly engaged at work, siezed him, tied his hands, and led him publicly through the village to the tavern. 
A crowd soon collected, foremost among whom was Mr. Lovejoy, who, coming up to the slaveholder, boldly demanded by what right he held that man bound. "Why," replied the other, "he is my slave." "Sir," said Mr. Lovejoy, "we do not recognize slavery in Illinois, and I demand by what right you hold that man." While Mr. Lovejoy was thus enlightening the Southerner on the subject of human rights, a warrant was procured, and the latter arrested for kidnapping. Dragging his slave with him, he was led off a prisoner to the court-house, the crowd following. The court-room was soon filled to overflowing, and in the bustle the slave, by some strategy, was separated from the master, the rope cut, and a passage opened through the crowd, which was instantly closed after him as he rushed out. The relative position of master and slave being thus essentially changed, the latter made good use of his time, and, being furnished with a horse, started for Mr. Lovejoy's residence, with friends and foes in full pursuit—Lovejoy and the tavern-keeper leading the way. Mr. Lovejoy arrived first, and, springing over the fence, turned to the tavern-keeper, who was about to follow, and ordered him not to intrude on his premises. 
Great numbers having again gathered, Mr. Lovejoy came out on the porch and said that, as they had assembled, he would improve the opportunity, and made them a speech suited to the occasion; taking for his text the passage, "Thou shalt not return unto his master the servant that is escaped from his master unto thee." While Mr. Lovejoy was thus occupying their attention, the slave, concealed in the bottom of a wagon, was quietly driven around in the rear, and off in a southerly direction. A runner, personating the fugitive, was, at the same time, started off north, and when he had got a sufficient distance, the alarm was given, and all instantly started in hot pursuit—the tools of slavery to catch their supposed victim, and the others to keep up the ruse. Our white fugitive made good time for Canada, but, after tiring out his pursuers, allowed them to come up, and very good naturedly asked them where they were all running to. The real fugitive, having taken the cars on the Underground railroad, was, by this time, out of reach of harm. 
Meanwhile, the slaveholder had his trial, and was held in bail for the nominal sum of $50 for his appearance at the ensuing term of the circuit court. Finding no one to become his security, he was kept under guard, but finally arranged the matter with the tavern-keeper, and left for the South, declaring that, if he ever lost another slave, he would not come to Princeton to look for him.

IN MEMORIAM.
SHELBY COUNTY, Ill., April 15, 1864. 
I read with tears the incidents of the sickness, death, and burial of Thomas Starr King. What a glorious death! But no wonder, because his life was a continual song of praise; and as a man lives, so does he die.
How can any one read of the last moments in the flesh of this good man, and the tender, touching memories of his life which his death brings to light, and believe them—which he must when be reads of such an involuntary outburst of popular grief—without shedding sad, sorrowful, and yet joyful tears! May our Father help us to emulate his virtues—his personal purity, his untiring industry, his noble self-sacrifice, his lofty patriotism, and his devotion to liberty and the cause of the poor and needy—that we may die as peaceful and hopeful as he, and pass up to as beautiful and glorious a life! How many that we seem to so much need are passing to a higher life! Thank God that we may hope they still live to labor for the cause that needs assistance!
On the first day of the present month, the fine, manly body of Owen Lovejoy was committed to the tomb. In the closing words of the elegy that was sung at his grave,
"In these free prairies of the West
We lay his manly form away; 
"Tis meet that here earth’s loving breast 
Receive again the conqueror’s clay.”
Doubtless, Lovejoy had his faults, for he was human; but what those faults were, even his enemies failed to discover, except that he loved freedom and hated slavery with all the intensity of a warm, full, ardent nature. His power to influence and interest the masses in the cause that was nearest his heart was immense. Three years ago the writer sat at his feet on a rude rostrum, constructed for the occasion in the middle of one of our largest prairies, and witnessed him keep as many men and women as could get within hearing of his unusually powerful voice spell-bound for full three hours by his matchless eloquence.
Two other distinguished speakers at the same time were discoursing from other stands, out their audiences constantly grew less, while his as constantly increased; and notwithstanding be was uttering sentiments that were unpopular then with the great mass of the Republicans, yet his voice was often drowned amid cheers and applause. And when utterly exhausted, sweating great drops of sweat, he was compelled to retire from the stand, hundreds of voices followed him crying, ”Hurrah for Lovejoy!" “Speak on!” "Speak on, Lovejoy!” "We'll listen to you till morning." I have heard the sweet, graceful, simple eloquence of Phillips—and he it was who convinced one person how great a sin he had committed in casting his first vote for James Buchanan —I have witnessed the strong, social, magnetizing eloquence of the late Senator Douglas; I have heard the smooth, finished periods of Everett; but I never knew a person who possessed such powers of winning the sympathy of all classes of society and influencing all degrees of intellect as did Owen Lovejoy. The secret of this power was his large, warm social nature, and his intimate sympathy with all classes and conditions of the human family, combined with an excellent judgment of human nature, a hearty good humor, a keen sense of the ridiculous, and a temperament so intense as to be susceptible of occasional inspiration. Often only a single speech or short acquaintance was necessary to convert his bitterest enemies into warm admirers and staunch friends. None but those "possessed," such as he had to face in Congress, could listen to him, and abuse him at the same time. I have heard a number, who were previously prejudiced against him, declare after hearing him speak that if Owen Lovejoy was an abolitionist, they were also. The future will alone reveal how much this champion of human rights has done for a State, which, alas! does not fully appreciate his labors, and which is yet darkened by a code of unchristian laws that are a disgrace to the civilized world.
Good, brave, true men are passing to their reward. How we can do without them, we may not know; but God does, which is infinitely better.

LETTER OF OWEN LOVEJOY.
The Princeton (III.) Republican says: 
"The following letter is, perhaps, the last one written by Mr. Lovejoy. It was in answer to one from Mr. J. H. Bryant, requesting his services in procuring the discharge of a hopelessly disabled soldier. Also an earnest inquiry as to his health, with an intimation that he, Bryant, feared that his sickness would prove fatal. The personal attention which Mr. Lovejoy gave to this business, even in his death sickness, was characteristic of his faithfulness. The reply about his health, 'I shall come out right,’ is also characteristic of the hope which ever buoyed him up. The close of his letter shows that his life idea, freedom, was the great subject of his thoughts:
"WASHINGTON, D. C., March 15, 1864.
"Dear Sir: I went in person and presented the case of the young man to the War Department. I cannot tell what will be the result, but I think he will be discharged.
"I shall come out all right. I am going to leave the city for a time, to get rid of the applicants who dog me so that I have no peace. I hope to return in two or three weeks with strength to advocate my bill for universal emancipation, and to exculpate the fathers and clear up the constitution from the charges of pro-slavery men.
"Very truly yours, OWEN LOVEJOY.”

THE SCHEME TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT LINCOLN. 
WASHINGTON, April 17, 1864. 
Two or three, and possibly more copperhead journals have seen fit to question the truth of my statements in regard to rebel schemes to kidnap or assassinate President Lincoln. That these friends of Jeff. Davis should endeavor to screen him and his followers from so serious a charge will not surprise you, and should not surprise the public. From the beginning of the war, these organs have affected to disbelieve nearly everything adverse or discreditable to their rebel friends that has appeared in print, and especially everything that has appeared in the Tribune. It would have been strange, indeed, if they had passed over my letters in silence; and I should have concluded that the intelligence offered by me was of little public interest or value. Encouraged by their denunciation and abuse, which I esteem the greatest compliments, as I should regard their praise the greatest censure that could be heaped upon me, I shall continue my correspondence as long as I have facts and information concerning rebels and rebeldom to enlighten and interest the public.
The schemes exposed by me to kidnap or kill the President of the United States may shock the unsophisticated, and to the novel reader may sound like romance, as charged by that disinterested and scrupulous journal, The Daily News; but to an intelligent public, who have watched, not with ”a single eye," but with all their eyes and senses, the conduct and proceedings of the rebels during the past three years, my story will not seem at all improbable.
The same copperhead journals that pretend to doubt my revelations of schemes to kidnap or assasinate President Lincoln, have never questioned with a single line the statements with which the Southern papers teemed of the plots on the part of Yankee spies and Union men in Richmond to assassinate Jeff. Davis. They can readily believe that Union men are capable of murdering the rebel President, but they cannot believe that the rebels would be guilty of murdering the Union President.
But I happen to have at hand evidence sufficient to satisfy any man who is open to conviction, that the scheme detailed by me to kidnap or assassinate our President are not romance, but real projects of a desperate and unscrupulous people. This evidence will be found in the following letter, which will speak for itself. The writer, who merely signs his surname, ”Cullom," rejoices in the Christian name of Calhoun. He is a captain in a North Carolina regiment, and is said to have distinguished himself in several affairs, in the last of which he was wounded. I enclose the original letter, because it carries on its face prima facie evidence of its genuineness—a Confederate ten cent postage stamp and the post mark of the place at which it was mailed. It will not be contended, even by the News, that the Tribune has friends in the Confederacy who could have prepared the letter and sent it through the mails, to give it a genuine appearance, as was done in the case of the T. Butler King letter. I received the letter from Mr. Wellford, a clerk in the War Office, to whom it was addressed, and have this and other reasons for knowing it to be authentic. But here is the letter:—
"MORGANTOWN, Sept. 30, 1863.
MY DEAR WELLFORD,—I have for several weeks been looking for a letter from you on the subject of our last conversation. On yesterday, Mr. Gaither, M. C. for the IXth District, came to see father and dined with us. He spent the week before last at Richmond, and had a number of conversations with the President, Secretary of War, and other officials. I inquired of him if he had heard anything of the ruse de guerre to capture "Honest Abe," and he said he had, but that the affair would probably be managed rather by individual enterprise than by the Government. He gave me the names of the most prominent workers in the project in Richmond, and as you must be acquainted with them all, I beg you to put in a timely word for me. If the affair was to be managed by the Government, I know your influence, and that of my other friends, with Mr. Seddon, would get me assigned to the part I desire to play in the grand comedy or tragedy, as the case may be; but if it is to be managed by the citizens of Richmond, my chances are not so good, and I may have to depend entirely on you. Speak a good word for me at once, and I will see you next week. As I told you, I would willingly sell my soul to the devil for the honor of playing a conspicuous part in the destruction of the great hydra.
My arm is nearly well, and I find it quite useful again, as you will conclude from my being able to dispense with an amanuensis.
Don't neglect me.
Your sincere friend,
CULLOM."
Now, to enable the curious to see with their own eyes the evidence of the rebel plots to kidnap or assassinate our President, and to prevent doubts on the part of suspicious copperheads that the evidence exists, as set forth, I suggest that you send the original letter to Barnum, or to the Sanitary Fair, where that liberal showman may have an opportunity of purchasing it as an addition to the curiosities of his Museum.-Corr. N. Y. Tribune.

ANOTHER INSTANCE OF REBEL BARBARITY.
A correspondent of the Cincinnati Commercial writing in Decatur, Alabama, gives the following account of another barbarous act of the rebels:
"Having often heard, since we came here, of the murder of a Probate Judge in the county south of us, which seems to have made a great impression on the minds of the people on account of its fiendishness, I made it my business to find out the particulars from refugees who knew the man and the manner of his death.
Hon. T. P. Curtis was Probate Judge of Winston county, (a new county, formed four years ago, and you do not find it on the maps,) directly south of Decatur. He was a quiet, unobtrusive man, held in the highest estimation by the people as an honest, conscientious, judicious officer. He had never made himself prominent as a politician, but, when the war broke out, modestly proclaimed himself against secession. His term of office having expired about two years ago, he offered again, and was elected over a violent secessionist. This completed his crimes in the eyes of the rebels, and he was marked for destruction. His property was destroyed by midnight depredators, and he was reduced to poverty. Charges of various kinds were brought against him as different times, but the investigations proved his innocence and established him in the good will of the community. At last, a band of desperadoes united with a number of rebel conscription officers and their agents, arrested him at night, conveyed him some miles from home into the woods, and went through the mockery of a trial. They then robbed him of everything except a part of his clothing, and threw him headlong from a high cliff. There his friends found him two days after. The fall had not killed him; he had crawled to the margin of a little creek in the ravine, and there had been shot in the head and through the body.
These refugees tell me that this is only one instance out of many. Do you wonder that they grind their teeth at the idea of compromising with such men? They ask, with evident anxiety, what course will the government pursue in relation to the Fort Pillow massacre?" 

GUERILLAS PUNISHED-A WHITE MAN SHOT BY A NEGRO.
A party of guerillas, about thirty in number, has just been disposed of by a party of scouts under Capt. Reynolds. They were heard of in Green County, roaming over the country, killing men, and boys of tender years; plundering houses, stealing horses, and committing other atrocities in keeping with their villanous profession. Accordingly, a detachment consisting of the 3d Indiana Cavalry and of Capt. Reynolds’ old party of scouts were sent in pursuit. The Union forces were divided and sent to guard three roads. The party immediately in command of Reynolds came upon a squad of the marauders, and killed ten of their number, taking no prisoners. The 3d Indiana Cavalry, with a captain in command, intercepted another portion of the same thieving crowd, and took fifteen of them prisoners, among the rest, a Capt. Reynolds, a desperate villain, who has been the terror of that region.
The details of the cold-blooded murders perpetrated by these guerillas (a wholly irresponsible set of highwaymen) would curdle the blood of all civilized men. Even boys of twelve years of age have been deliberately shot because they would not tell the place of concealment of their fathers. And women have been punished with lashes on the naked flesh to compel them to tell where their husbands were, or to point out the place where they had concealed the food to keep themselves and family from starvation. A perfectly credible person, who is familiar with the history of these murderous outrages
<c06>
in the upper counties, says he can go to graves of ten persons, from boys of twelve and fifteen years up to old men of sixty, who were compelled to dig their own graces and get into them, and then were shot to death—all for the crime of being for the Union. The capture, killing, and dispersion of this band will break up for a time these lawless and inhuman proceedings in the neighborhood referred to Capt. Reynolds, the old scout, who has so often distinguished himself in hunting and dispersing these guerillas, is entitled to great credit for this last achievement. The Captain commanding the detachment of the 3d Indiana Cavalry (I have not his name) should also receive a due share of credit.
A black soldier belonging to Major McGowan’s Regiment of 1st 1st U. S. Colored Artillery, (heavy,) yesterday, shot another, a white soldier, belonging to the 1st Ohio heavy artillery. This announcement I know will send a thrill of holy horror through the land, and there will be a universal how! over the circumstances, with renewed denunciations of the negro regiments. Not for the benefit of such men, but to satisfy the good and loyal people of the country, all of whom will sincerely deplore the occurrence., I will state what is known of the affairs at headquarters. The black soldier who killed the Ohio soldier had frequently been set upon, insulted and maltreated by the men of this battery, and by this very man. He had been stoned and threatened with death, and this conduct had become so habitual that no black soldier could pass along the road where these battery-men were without being stoned, assaulted, or in some way abused. The officers had submitted to this state of things until they saw the demoralizing influence of it upon their men; and that further toleration of this abuse would be criminal. The soldiers were then told to defend themselves; to avoid all quarrels, if possible, and keep out of the way of these men, but if assaulted to protect themselves. It seems deceased began by using abusive language toward the negro as he was going peaceably along the road, and followed it up by throwing stones at him, but the black man ran, and tried to avoid a collision. A comrade of the assailant remonstrated with him, and told him "to let the negro alone," but he continued to follow and stone the black man, all the time swearing he would kill him. Finding that the man was in earnest in his threats, and that he could not escape, he drew his pistol and fired at his pursuer, and killed him on the spot. 

EXECUTION OF B. W. WOOTER.
HAINES BLUFF, (Miss.) April 24, 1864.
The undersigned, officers of the Third regiment United States cavalry (colored) make the following statement in relation to the hanging of B. W. Wooster, (a citizen) at this place, this 24th day of April, 1864.
Mr. B. W. Wooster made the statement to Major J. B. Cook, 3d United States cavalry (colored) that he (B. J. Wooster) considered that the rebel General Forrest was perfectly justified in massacring the brave colored garrison at Fort Pillow, Tennessee, on his capture of that place. He (B. W. Wooster) made the statement to colored soldiers of the 3d United States cavalry (colored) that the rebels were right in killing them when captured, alluding to Fort Pillow, Tennessee, and the murder of men belonging to the regiment at Roache's Plantation, Miss. 
Said B. W. Wooster drew his knife on knife of a colored soldier, Amos Hurd, Co. K, U. S. cavalry, (colored) while said soldier was on guard duty, and threatened to cut his throat.
The said B. W. Wooster was at the time engaged in purchasing cotton and other speculations, under the protection of a brigade of colored soldiers, while in the enemy's country on an expedition, towards Yazoo City, Miss.
He was arrested by order of Col. E. D. Osband, commanding the regiment. During the absence of Col. Osband, at brigade headquarters, the undersigned officers of the regiment met, and dispassionately heard the testimony in the case, decided that he should be hung, and did hang him.

ANOTHER STEP FORWARD.
The New England Conference of the M. E. Church, at its last session, pulled down another of those bars of prejudice which have been so sedulously erected by church and state for centuries in our land. They admitted Rev. Mr. Mars, a colored preacher, into their ranks. Mr. Mars is of Virginian and Presbyterian descent. His father was a Presbyterian clergyman of Norfolk, and his mother the minister's slave. No scarlet letter blazed upon the brow of that transgressor, though Hawthorne is not needed to prove that it burned into his soul. His son has long been a distinguished minister in Western Massachusetts, was chaplain in the 1st North Carolina, was discharged for sickness, and expects to return to Newbern or Norfolk under the direction of the Missionary Society of his church. He was very popular there, and will be a very valuable acquisition to that society. In admitting him, the Conference cut the gordian knot that is perplexing some of the Methodist leaders. What shall be the relations of the new church of the South with the North? Some are attempting to reorganize it on its old basis of separation—colored colored churches for colored conferences and synods. This clergyman, being a member of a regularly instituted conference, must be a member of that which shall be organized in the territory where he labors. He is eligible to the General Conference and the bishopric of that church, and may yet reach these honors. That church and all other churches must be organized without consideration of color. Ministers of every complexion, and people also, shall dwell in unity and fraternity; the pastors being appointed or installed according to merit, not complexion. It will fare hard for some Caucasians in such a rivalry; but such is the future fate of the church and nation. The favorite missionary lines will then have a truer meaning than they ever had before in this country:
"People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on his praise with sweetest song."

DEMOCRACY CLASSIFIED.
